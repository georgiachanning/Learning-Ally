Parent and community partnerships are vital to the heartbeat of the school. Parent involvement is 
welcomed and we offer many opportunities for parents and families to engage with our 

learning. With our newly elected officers in our Parent Teacher Association we are excited to work 
together and foster those relationships so we can do what is best for our students. Additionally, we 
understand that we cannot succeed without the
 
support of our families and community members. 
We take pride in working alongside our families and community members to ensure that we do 
everything we can to help our students have a memorable and meaningful elementary education.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the

e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities);

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful analysis of achievement data. The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teach
ers also have opportunities to attend conferences 
and district
-
wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2019
-
20 school year all teachers at El Toyon School will receive 
approximately 30 hours of professional development in mathematics 
through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This professional 
development will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes h
ands
-
on, research
-
based professional developm
ent, standards
-
based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the 
implementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content exp
erts, and math 
educa
tion researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the 
needs highlighted 
in our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in
-
depth professional developm
ent in the California ELA/ELD framework. 
The ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English langu
age learners and the 
need for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materi
als needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have 
been delivered through teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and 
during individual teacher
 
planning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and 
English Language Development. We also have credentialed teachers that provide Engineering is Elementary lessons for students.
 
This pr
ovides 
opportunity for the Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all teachers will receive s
taff development in the 
implementation of our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous readi
ng, our district office has adopted the American 
Reading Company 100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff development on the implementation and best practices used
 
for these reading baskets 
for students. Our counselors have received training on 
the Sanford Harmony social
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. 
Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In a
ddition, all teachers have 
received prof
essional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior inter
ventions and 
supports to all students. of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for implementation 
of Common Core Standards, best 
practices for Data Teams collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathemati
cs, as well as specific 
training to support the needs of English Learners. Teachers of students with
 
special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized 
training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various f
ormats, including whole staff 
group, grade
-
level teams, a
nd through individual mentoring by the school administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction 
Support for year one and two teachers. Teachers who are experiencing difficulty or need improvement have access to the PAR (P
eer As
sistance Review) 
Program.
