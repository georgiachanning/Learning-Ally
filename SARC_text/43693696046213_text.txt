By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district
 
uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School C
onstruction. The results of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
Linda Vista School was built in 1950. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field Act requirements of the 
State Building Code with a foc
us on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead containing building materials 
are found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, and Local requirements. 
Deferred maintenance funds have been used to properly 
maintain and renovate district buildings. Needed repairs and 
maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
Whenever possible, school facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 
classroom, office, lib

the instructional program. The Alum Rock School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, 
ensure the school buildings an
d grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that 
classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and staff use.
 
Regular oversight by district maintenan
ce crews ensures that grass and landscaped areas are well maintained, and that 

 
Informational Technology installed a new public address system that includes a clock and bell component. The res
ults of 
these renovations have improved our safety and have given us a more modern appearance. We have also improved the 
number of wireless hubs located throughout the campus. Our student have access to seven carts with 35 wireless laptops 
that arrived dur
ing the latter part of 2013 along with  We have one cart for every three classrooms.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., Cal
ifornia Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/lit
eracy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core S
tate Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State
 
University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To help ensure school safety, all visitors are required to check
-
in at the school office. In addition, the
 
district provides extra 
yard duty supervisors. All yard duty supervisors and school staff maintain a welcoming but controlled campus 
environment. The school grounds and playground are safe because they are well
-
supervised by staff before, during, and 
afte
r school.
 
 
Safety programs for students include anti
-
bullying, drug awareness, personal safety, and personal growth.
 
The San Jose Police Department Community Liaison assists the school principal with families who have truancy and 
supervision issues. A Stud
ent Attendance Review Board (SARB) and a School Site Team are in place to reduce truancy. 
Linda Vista Visual and Performing Arts Anchor School has a very detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines 
protocols, systems, and procedures in the eve
nt of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains the yearly safety goals as 
determined by the students, staff, and parents. The safety plan is reviewed and revised annually by the Linda Vista Safety 
Committee before it is presented to the Alum Rock Union 
Elementary School District Board of Trustees for annual 
approval. The revised plan was last approved in February 2015 and is currently being updated. The safety plan and drill 
procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety alerts are shared
 
with all staff as needed throughout the 
school year. In addition, all required drills (earthquake, fire, safety) are calendared and completed, and the results are 
shared with the staff.
 
 
The Linda Vista Safety Plan contains a comprehensive, enforceable, a
nd continuous behavior policy, set of rules and 
regulations, dress code policy, protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral policy, 
Internet policy, and nondiscriminatory policy on student rights and responsibilities.
