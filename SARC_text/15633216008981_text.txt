By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters. As you 
read the Report Card, you will 
gain a better understanding of Horace Mann Elementary as a school with a commitment 
towards academic achievement and continuous improvement, a faculty that is professionally skilled and personally 
committed to meeting the learning needs of students, and a 
student body that is enthusiastic and motivated to achieve 
to their fullest potential. 
 
 
At Horace Mann School we believe that: 
 

 
A strong academic background is essential for all students to have successful and productive lives.
 

 
Teachers, administrators, p

mission.
 

 
Students learn in different ways and should be provided with a variety of instructional approaches to support 
their learning.
 

 
A safe, attractive and physically comfortabl
e environment promotes student learning.
 

 
The commitment to continuous improvement is imperative if our school is going to enable students to become 
confident, self
-
directed learners.
 
* Parents are the child's first teacher and we will do all we can to support the needs of families, provide training and 
opportunities for them to be a part of the education for their child. 
 
 
The mission of Horace Mann School is to create a learning commu
nity where individuality is valued and students are 
motivated to learn the necessary skills to become productive citizens in an ever
-
changing society.
 
 
Narrative is developed and provided by the LEA.
 
 
Suggested questions that may be answered include:
 

 
Horac
e Mann is unique because it is one of the oldest standing schools in the Bakersfield City School District. 
Opened first in 1927, it has withstood the test of time, undergone major remodels, leadership and personnel. 
The one thing that remains the same is t
he commitment to excellence in academics, efforts to support families 
and leadership that focuses on student achievement.
 

 
Horace Mann goals for the coming year are to raise tests scores in not only state assessments in Reading and 
Math but to also raise ac
hievement levels in formative assessments along the way. We aim to gain +3 points 
toward the state standards and grow 10% in reading and math on STAR tests. We also have goals to increase 
attendance percentages and lower the number of chronic absenteeism.
 

 
Progress indicators will include District formative assessment results, increased attendance and lowering 
chronic absenteeism.
 

 
Attendance will be monitored daily and chronic absenteeism will be monitored weekly. Assessments will be 
monitored quarterly by t
he District data management tools.

The School will focus on good first instruction for students being key. We will monitor and assess students as 
needed for the MTSS process to rule out disabilities and institute early intervention. Students will be using 
Accelerated Reader, STAR reading and math to help achieve academic goals and students needing intensive 
intervention in reading will join a reading group with the intervention specialist. Teachers will be provided 
opportunities for cognitive coaching with 
the Academic Program Leader and the Academic Coach. The 
Academic Program Leader and the Academic Coach will model lessons, make observations and deliver cognitive 
feedback to help teachers remain focused on the accurate delivery of content knowledge, lesso
n planning, 
behavior management and assessment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training opportunities affirm the 
basic philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruction and student learning.
 
 
All training revolves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, the Common Core 
State Sta
ndards, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning Communities through our Se
rvice Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and resources for collaboration, 
planning, and professional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received four days of professional development prior to th
e beginning of the school year 
focused on orientation to District and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up the classroom. Teachers in their second year 
with 
the District received two days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
site and focused on improving best practices.

New teachers with California preliminary credentials received professional devel
opment through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California
 
Induction 
standards. The culmination of TIP is the recommendation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
veteran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional development in 
coaching/mentoring strategies,
 
instructional strategies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthly meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional development at monthly meetings focusing on t
he initial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day
-
to
-
day support in these areas as we
ll as advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern
 
Program.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Cred
ential. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provide
d a weekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university part
ners to ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
