School Description
 
San Luis Rey Elementary School holds high expectations for student achievement and behavior. We 
provide HOPE to our students and the community. H 
-
  
We Honor and Respect everyone. O 
-
 
Open 
Hearts and Minds. P 
-
 
Perseverance; We never give up. E 
-
 
Everyone 
is Family. We are committed 
to helping each student become academically successful. Our dedicated teachers meet with 
parents and discuss with them how they can better support their child. Grade
-
level teams 
collaborate to ensure that teachers cover the Comm
on Core Standards during each school year. 
Our small enrollment of about 275 students allows us to pay close attention to individual students.
 
 
We strive to have a balanced approach to teaching children literacy, and provide different programs 
to help 
students at their particular level. To support math instruction, most of our teachers have 
been trained with Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) strategies as well as the Go Math Program. 
We have two computer labs that allow students individual practice t
argeted to their particular 
needs and skills. Our 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students also have access to one to one Chromebooks 
to enhance their learning experience and better prepare them for the 21st Century and real world 
skills. We provide a wonderful af
ter
-
school program through the Boys and Girls Club of Oceanside, 
which gives students a great place to go after hours.
 
 
Parents are integral to our success. We encourage you to attend School Site Council, PTA, and 
English Language Advisory Committee meetin
gs. We appreciate parents who participate in school 
functions. Please volunteer in our classrooms or our school
-
wide events like Fall Festival, Field Day, 
and Math and Literacy Nights.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by sta
te 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requi
red to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to
 
be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the s
chool principal or the 
district office.
