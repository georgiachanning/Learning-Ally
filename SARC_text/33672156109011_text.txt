By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

It was determined that each RUSD school had sufficient and good qual
ity textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab 
equipment, where appropriate, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or
 
instructional materials, or both, in core 
subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a 
6
-
year cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in t
he school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
avai
lable for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption
 
 
Riverside Unified School District adopts instructional materials on a regular schedule based on State adoptions. All 
students receive appropriate, up

number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who 
met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many opportunities for parental involvement at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School, beginning with our 
Benjamin Franklin Parent Teacher Organization.  The PTO supports various school events such as the Welcome Tea, Book 
Fair, Red Ribbon Week, Rea
d Across America, "Oh the Places You Will Go!" College and Career Fair, after school 
enrichment classes, and many other family
-
oriented events such as the Father/Daughter Dance, Mother /Son Sports Day, 
and school
-
wide Winter Festival.  They also raise mone
y to help fund field trips, assemblies, awards, and science camp.  
Every classroom invites parents in to support student achievement as well as enrichment.
 
 
Our Parent Advisory Committee is a branch of PTO and is another opportunity for parents to particip
ate in the 
development of student centered programs and the monitoring of instructional programs.  Parents are also invited to 
volunteer in their child's classroom. When children see their parents participating at the school, they recognize that school
 
is 
an important part of their lives and that a good education is a family value.  Parents can contact the school Principal, 
Dawn Smith, or PTO President, Farrah Stewart, at 951

Professional development is an ongoing effort at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School. Areas for Professional 
Development are determined from student achievement data and staff surveys. During the 
2017
-
18 school year teachers 
participated in a variety of Professional Development offerings through the school site as well as the District. These 
trainings included the following: 
 
 
1. Our staff attending publisher presentations for Amplify, the publishe
r of an ELA program that incorporates Core 
Knowledge content, in preparation for Frankin becoming a Core Knowledge school.
 
 
2. RTI Model Training for all grade levels, including the mClass platform for administering DIBELS, and "Burst" and RtI 
program for 
early intervention of reading difficulties. 
 
 
3. Grade Level planning for the new language arts adoption, training in the Eureka mathematics program, and the use of 
Zearn and Dreambox for intervention and acceleration.
 
 
4. Targeting English Learners (ongoi
ng)
 
 
5. Personalized Learning with Discovery Education, Pear Deck, Kids Discover, and Dreambox (staff meetings, team 
meetings)
 
 
8. CCSS implementation and academic vocabulary training
 
 
9. We continue our focus on research, listening comprehension, and writ
ing instruction. One of our LCAP strategies to 
support ELA achievement focus this year is writing, and we are using a graphic organizer model systematically throughout 
the grades.
 
 
10. We are now a Core Knowledge school. This involved switching to the Ampl
ify CKLA (Cpre Knowledge Language Arts) in 
grades K
-
5 and Amplify 6
-
8 digital middle school curriculum for our 6th graders. We prepared an application for the school 
board that was presented in January of 2017. We anticipated that this will support our rea
ding comprehension and writing 
goals. Core Knowledge has a specific body of knowledge that starts in Kindergarten and builds each year, giving students 
a broad knowledge background in literature, history, geography, and the arts. End of year scores indicat
ing growth across 
all grade levels.
 
 
In the 2018
-
19 and 19
-
20 School Year, teachers attended professional development in the areas of:
 

 
Project Read (support for early reading intervention)
 

 
mClass
 

 
Google Apps for Education through RUSD's 
Innovation and Learner
 

 
Three full days of textbook adoption review for one teacher per grade level for Amplify CKLA

Depending on the grade level, subject or school focus, teachers participated in 3 

 
10 days of professional development. 
 
 
Franklin is now a full Core Knowledge school, which means we have adopted the Amplify Core Knowledge Language Arts 
program for grades K
-
5 as well as Amplify ELA middle school curriculum for grade 6. All teachers have had access to a third 
day of professi
onal development and planning. 
 
 
We continue to have a 1 FTE Reading Intervention TOSA to support our mClass reading diagnostic and intervention 
program. With the help of our R.I. teacher, all staff members are being trained in the use of the mClass digita
l platform 
for DIBELS. Through this we are able to drill down and identify more specific skill deficits, create groups by name and need,
 
and use the Burst program to generate 10 day cycles of lessons. After each "Burst" students are monitored for progress 
in mClass. In
-
class coaching will be provided through the R.I. teacher and administration.
 
 
Additionally, we work collaboratively with the .4 TOSA's from the other two Core Knowledge to provide ongoing staff 
development and planning during staff meetings a
nd planning time.
