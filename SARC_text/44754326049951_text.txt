Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Vine Hill School takes pride in the safety and 
cleanliness of our school facility. All classrooms are attractive, comfortable 
and have adequate lighting. Our custodial staff consists of one daytime facilities specialist, and one half time evening 
facilities specialist. These facilities specialists are 
responsible for and take pride in keeping a clean, beautiful campus for 
all. Aside from their janitorial responsibilities they also perform routine maintenance tasks.
 
 
The campus has a number of features beyond the classrooms. The school maintains an ADA a
ccessible outdoor Life Lab 
to provide experiential learning opportunities for all students. There is an outdoor amphitheater large enough to hold the 
entire student body for assemblies and events. There are three distinct playground areas: a kindergarten o
nly area; a 
playground area containing play structures; and an area containing basketball and tetherball courts and a baseball 
diamond.

We have an active Safety Committee that reviews safety plans, procedures, and provides safety education to our 
staff. 
We have a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan in place and drills are routinely held. Recesses and lunch periods are 
staggered to limit the number of students on the playground thus ensuring more effective supervision of students. The 
campus is lit 
with motion sensor devices, and any graffiti is removed immediately. Each campus has an annual safety 
inspection performed by an external agency to assist us in providing safe facilities.
 
 
District maintenance personnel attend to maintenance needs at each 
campus on an ongoing basis, with service requests 
being managed through a web
-
based work order system. To assist in the effort to ensure clean, safe and functional 
facilities, the district uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of Califor
nia Office of Public School 
Construction and conducts annual self
-
inspections, recording the results of the inspection on the survey document. Below 
is more specific information about the school and the efforts made to ensure that students and staff are pr
ovided with a 
clean, safe and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of the School Buildings: Built in 1959, Vine Hill has 27 classrooms, a library and a computer lab. Ten of the classrooms 
are portables. The permanent buildings were modernized in 1995.
 
 
Cl
eaning Process and Schedule: The district has adopted cleaning standards. The principal works daily with the custodial 
staff to develop and adjust cleaning schedules to ensure a clean, safe campus. All restrooms are checked throughout the 
day for cleanline
ss and adequate supplies. In good weather, when students eat lunch outside, lunch tables and the 
immediate grounds are washed down daily. Vine Hill implements a recycling program in the classrooms and during lunch.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District mainten
ance personnel make every effort to ensure that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. Safety issues are given the highest priority.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only e

The District provides two staff development days each 
year.  Content of those days for 2019
-
20 focused on training in 
using data systems and technology, and social and emotional support for all students.  Additionally, teams of teaching 
staff and administration attend ongoing training throughout the year.  So
me of the more notable trainings are SVMI 
(Silicon Valley Math Initiative) through a grant with S4C (Santa Cruz County College Commitment), English Learners, NGSS 
(Next Generation Science Standards), PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, IB (In
ternational Baccalaureate) 
training in specific subjects, and Special Education topics including compliance, behavior analysis and strategies.
 
 
All certificated staff meet weekly in a restructured day schedule in order to have Professional Development and 
Collaboration. The weekly work centers around district goals to increase student achievement and the site Single School 
Plan for Student Achievement. Our plan identifies specific goals for school improvement in all subject areas. These goals 
are part of th
e outcome of staff and School Site Council analysis of student achievement data, as well as feedback from 
parent and student surveys. Staff development needs are identified as a result of student achievement performance. 
During the past several years, emph
asis was given to learning strategies appropriate to English Learners, students with 
disabilities, analysis of student work, and strategies to address needs of students not meeting standards. We continue to 
work on essential standards and benchmarks. The w
eekly professional development time provides opportunities for cross 
grade level collaboration. All sites participate in the New Teacher Project for first and second year teachers.
