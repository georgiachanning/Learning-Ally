School Description
 
Taylor Middle School is located in a suburban community with a rich history and a dedication to 
education, as documented in the documentary Taylor Middle School's 75th Anniversary 
Documentary, found on
-
line. Taylor is a sixth through eighth grade middle school with a diverse 

e all students 
regardless of socioeconomic status, race, or gender. Our purpose is to provide the information and 
skills necessary for students to become responsible, healthy, young adults. It is our intention to 
provide a rigorous standards
-
based educatio
n to all students while educating the whole child to 

action items that address the district's goals around nurturing emotional intelligence, promoting a 
passion 
for learning in our young people, and to foster an innovative learning environment 
accessed by all students. The topics central to our strategic plan included an emphasis on student 
wellness, college and career, the appropriate integration of technology in
to instruction, 
strengthening community relationships, academic department's focus on implementation of new 
curriculum as well as next generation standards and frameworks, and the development of the 
Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support program. Al
l of this work is framed by our district's 
LCAP goals that promote the common core, multiple tiered support for all students, and the making 
and sustaining of community relationships and partnerships.
 
 
We have instituted a full multidisciplinary curriculum
 
school
-
wide to meet the needs of all students. 
The academic program is creative and rigorous, yet accessible to all, and aligned to the California 
Common Core Standards. We support professional development of all staff members according to 
the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession with an emphasis on collaborative curriculum 
implementation that have professionals sharing best practices and studies approaches to the new 
curriculum. As a result, we are able to provide a gradual, nurturing transiti
on to middle school life 
with a two
-
period sixth grade core program of English and social studies, and science and math in 
the sixth grade and stand along courses in all other contexts. All sixth graders take mathematics 
and science in the cored environmen

technology, computer science, architecture, literature courses, and music and orchestra. Our 
seventh grade program provides a two
-
period English
-
social studies core that gradually prepares 
students 
for the eighth grade program. Seventh graders take science, PE, mathematics, and an 
elective class. Our eighth grade offers one period of English, United States History, science and 
math. All eighth graders take PE as well as one elective class that meet d
aily. We offer grade level 
appropriate math (Illustrative Math) with offerings of accelerated math at the seventh and eighth 
grade levels. Taylor offers reading and math support classes through both teacher 
recommendation, and to students who scored Below 
Proficient on benchmarks. Taylor Middle 
School offers a rich elective program that includes Broadcast Journalism, Art, Drama, Leadership, 
Music, a year
-
long STEAM class, and Spanish. Students participate in a variety of critical
-
thinking 
activities in our 
21st century technology courses, computer labs, and our live TV show. Every day, 
students produce an eight
-
minute morning show featuring school news, athletic activities, 
community news and current events.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Taylor Middle School was built in 1939. It has had a wide range of uses throughout its
 

as well as social activities. For its age, Taylor is in amazing shape despite the cutbacks, budget reductions, and decreased 
custodial and maintenance staff. 
The dedicated custodial staf
f and the district maintenance staff are dedicated to keeping every classroom clean and restrooms hygienic on a daily basis. 
As a result of Measure X passed in 2009 and Measure N passed in 2012, the school has undergone numerous improvements to class
rooms,
 
bathrooms 
and walkways in compliance with ADA (American Disability Act). The existing cafeteria was demolished in 2012 and a significan
tly larger state
-
of
-
the
-
art 
cafeteria has been built. The new building is referred to the Caroline Shea center after a T
aylor staff member passed away several years ago This new 
building accommodates over 1,500 students and serve as a cafeteria and meal preparation site for the school district.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Taylor Middle School enjoys a history of posit
ive relationships among schools, parents, and community members through open communication and 
shared decision making that puts students first. These opportunities to engage our parent and Millbrae communities centers up
on an effort to treat 
every person w
ho walks through the Taylor front door  to feel welcome and appreciated no matter their background or the need they may have 
to 
address with the school. At the Board level, each televised district board meeting features the many positive activities in w
hic
h children are involved, in 
which Taylor Middle School participates and most recently featured three student groups from drama, math and English demonstr
ating classroom 
activities. At the school level, we also have an active PTA that coordinates volunteer 
activities, raise funds for classroom expenditures and larger school 
projects, and helps to maintain a culture of support for our teachers and staff. Parents provide luncheons and special events
 
for faculty and staff. Parents 
also volunteer as chaperones o
n field trips and the eighth grade promotion picnic and dance. Some activities are designed as fundraisers and others are 
appreciation events or community pursuits. The Taylor PTA actively provides a variety of assemblies each year to support educ
ational p
rograms. Decision 
making is shared at our school. Advisory groups, including the ELAC and the School Site Council, and the Department Represent
atives meet throughout 
the school year. For the general population of parents and community members, parent educa
tion is a high priority in the Millbrae School District and at 
Taylor Middle School, with several parent
-
education programs each year. We understand that it is important to keep parents well informed about 
changes in our curriculum, our emphasis on college
 
and career readiness, or in the case of an upcoming Principal's Coffee, the plight and possibilities of 
social media and children. We often include guest speakers and other experts who speak to these issues or address matters of 
upward articulation to 
the
 
high schools we feed.
 
 
Taylor provides behavior expectations for each student and family outlining expected standards of behavior, a calendar of eve
nts for the years, and other 
essential information through the publication of our Bulldog Binder 
Reminder and academic calendar. The Taylor Principal sends a monthly newsletter 
through email and posts on the website to keep parents informed about current and upcoming activities, including PTA and dist
rict news and employs 
other opportunities to connec
t to parents and all stakeholders. The school maintains a comprehensive activities calendar on Google Calendar for ease of 
access. Many teachers send frequent updates on class activities through our web
-
based parent portal. Frequent autodial messages are s
ent to Taylor 
families about upcoming events. These forms of communication help promote parent involvement.

Program, the San Mateo Sheriff Depart
ment and the Millbrae Fire Department, the School Site Council revised and implemented a new School Safety 
Plan that provides updated emergency responses and procedures that are standard across this county. We hold regular emergenci
es drills on the campus 
and lockdown drills in collaboration with the sheriff and fire department. All students and staff review emergency procedures
 
before a drill. Staff debriefs 
with local agencies on a regular basis. The Millbrae School District has a Memorandum of Understand

Both agencies work closely together to ensure student safety. The school grounds are monitored 30 minutes before and after sc
hool by administrators 
or designated staff. Students learn rules for conduct to
 
create a safe environment and those are reinforced through production videos and PSAs that 
educate the school community about how to act and respond in all areas of the campus. Teachers regularly review the rules for
 
safe, responsible behavior 
in school a
nd in areas of the campus through the establishment and delivery of the BARK Code of Conduct that asks students to Build Up O
thers, to Act 
Responsibly, to be Ready to Learn, and to Know What Is Right. Visitors must sign in at the office, where they receive
 
a bright badge to wear throughout 
their stay. The school has an autodial system that, in case of emergency, instantly phones parents with the most current info
rmation. The Millbrae 

 
San Mateo Sheriff Department has assigned a School Resource Officer to the 
Taylor campus that provides excellent support for our school.

During the school 
year, our teachers attended various professional workshops. Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and EL
A, 
and a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the estab
lis
hment of curriculum 
maps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pac
ing guides that assign fidelity 
to the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consis
ts of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted 
Social Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for te
achers to collaborate on 
school wide topics. Our professi
onal development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of 
the classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.

Types of Services Funded
 
State Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs. The PTA and 
San Mateo County Office 
of Education fund 
our school homework center staffed most mornings and afternoons by certificated teachers. The PTA raised funds to purchase 
Chromebooks, new TVs, document cameras and other instructional technologies. We use Federal English Language Acquisition Prog
ram fund
s to pay for 
a part
-
time English language coordinator and a teacher to instruct the newcomers in an intensive English Language Development (ELD) 
class. The district 
Technology Plan allows for a shift of technology purchasing away from the school site and o
n to a district budget line item, and the appropriate 
infrastructure for deploying 21st century educational technologies is supported through district office resources. The Taylor
 
Middle School library was 
refurbished and updated care of a partnership betw
een the Chinese Business Association, Taylor PTA, and the MESD District Office.
