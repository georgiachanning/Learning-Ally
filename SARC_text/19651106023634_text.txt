By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

to our decision to purchase instructional 
materials aligned with the State Standards. Currently, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curricu
lum, which includes 


 
Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common
 
Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy 
skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell w
ere purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there 
is 
a process to order additional materials througho
ut the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our schoo
l complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provi
de supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full
 
implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 
recomm

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Phelan School is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions which contribute to 
the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Phelan provides
 
compiles school crime information each month for the California Safe 
School Assessment as mandated by the State of California. This information is analyzed at each school site to 
determine what steps may be taken to reduce incidents of crime.
 
2.
 
Child Abuse 
Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected 
child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any 
follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
3.
 
Disast
er Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school safety committee 
has created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan. Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated 
for effectiveness. Safety concerns are a
ddressed at each staff meeting.
 
4.
 
School Discipline: Phelan School has created a school
-
wide discipline plan using Caring School Communities in 
order to communicate high standards and expectations and to hold students accountable for their behavior. The 
disc
ipline plan is given to every student and reviewed by classroom teachers. Staff members consistently enforce 
the school
-
wide standards. In addition, Phelan is a PBIS school where students are taught behavioral strategies to 
implement in the classroom, libr
ary, playground, and lunch area. With the support from the school psychologist, 
teachers and staff participate in staff development to enforce positive behavior.
 
5.
 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: If a student is deemed dangerous 
because of behavior at 
school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authorities, the teacher(s) of 
the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student.
 
6.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Phelan School strictly adh
eres to district policies which prohibit sexual harassment or 
discrimination of any kind. The sexual harassment policy is distributed to each student at the beginning of the 
school year, and employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they
 
become aware of any incidents 
of sexual harassment.
 
7.
 
School
-
wide Dress Code: Phelan School is a uniform school. We believe that a clearly defined dress code 
contributes to a positive school environment. The primary standards for student dress and grooming 
include that 
the student should be neat and clean at school, and the student should not wear clothing that compromises safety 
or modesty or that is disruptive to the educational process.
 
8.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Phelan School believes a safe and order
ly environment is necessary to ensure a 
positive learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, administrators, campus supervisors and parent volunteer
s 
consistently supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
 
9.
 
Campus Security and Safety: Phelan is a closed campus and gates are kept locked during school hours. Teachers 
follow a schedule for recess duty o
n the playground, helping ensure that playground rules are adhered to for 
student safety at all times. We also hold monthly fire, lock down, and earthquake drills. Protocols and procedures 
have been established for all possible emergencies. Teachers and st
aff are aware of their roles in case of an 
emergency and every child is provided with an emergency earthquake kit.
 
 
The safety plan was reviewed, updated and discussed with the . We continuously revisit and update our school plan as we 
practice our drills 
throughout the year.
 
 
Finally, a strong partnership exists between our school and local law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies provide 
ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel in case of a campus or 
neighborhood 
threat.
