About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SAR
C 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which 
describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are 
provided at both the district and individual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The district offers two full
-
day staff development days and eight Wednesday afternoon sessions annually, 
where staff members are offered professio
nal growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Common Core Standards, 
Next Generation Science Standards, Project Based Learning, Readers Workshop, Writers Workshop, Math in Focus and technology i
nfused instruction 
are being
 
integrated into the curriculum. Teachers also review student data, make timely decisions based in data, and share practical t
ips and strategies 
with each other, during their collaborative prep and meeting time. This year, we continued coaching and collabo
ration sessions for teachers during the 
school day. In addition to opportunities through the district, site "Flex Funds"  as well as other targeted budgets are used 
to provide professional 
development to teachers to attend workshops, observe in other class
rooms and to collaborate with colleagues. Areas of focus are determined by our 
Strategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.
