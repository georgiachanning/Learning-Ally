By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Students feel comfortable and safe on school grounds before, during and after school. During school 
hours, students are 
supervised by school faculty and staff. The school facility includes sufficient classroom space to meet the needs of an 
enrollment of approximately 440 students. The playground sufficiently provides play areas for students with the assi
stance 
of block scheduling to facilitate efficient usage of the playground. To ensure optimal learning opportunities, faculty and 
staff coordinate classroom facility usage to include intervention instruction. The district takes great efforts to ensure tha
t
 
all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility survey instrument develop
ed 
by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the school offic
e 
or at the district office.

Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Climate: Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to check in at the school 

RAPTOR Program which connects with Megan's law software; visitors are required to return to the school office upon 
departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, assigned staff m
embers supervise students and school 
grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The Comprehensive Safe 
School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. Development o
f the safety plan 
was a joint effort of school staff and School Site Council. Brea Police Department and Fire Department were consulted in 
the writing and development of our plan. Our action plan has four primary goals. They are: 1) All students and staff 
members are provided a safe learning and teaching environment. 2) All students are safe and secure while at school, when 
traveling to and from school, and when traveling to and from school related activities. 3) District programs and approved 
community res
ources are made available to students and parents. 4) Our school will provide the educational environment 
where students, parents, staff, and community members shall effectively communicate in a manner that is respectful to 
all cultural, racial, and religi
ous backgrounds. The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly 
learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current 
status of school crime; child abuse reporti
ng procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to 
suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe 
ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school emplo
yees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and 
procedures. Annually, the school evaluates and updates the plan. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School 
Plan, are reviewed with school and District staff in the fall, at the 
start of each school year.

a plan to increase achievement in identified areas. After District goals and expectations are set, this team reaches out to 
schools through needs assessment surveys regarding individual school concerns and needs. Us
ing results from the survey, 
combined with data analysis from standardized tests and District assessments, the committee creates a plan that is 
implemented at all schools.
 
 
 
Arovista develops its own plan for training activities to improve instruction and 
to increase student proficiency. The 
California Department of Education requires schools to develop improvement plans (
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement) 
based upon analysis of pupil achievement in meeting State standards for student proficiency. Each ye
ar, the plan is 
reviewed and updated to reflect the changing needs of Arovista students.
 
 
 
During the 2018
-
20 school years, District specialists and school leadership teams reviewed and updated achievement 
plans using student assessment data. Findings were
 
used to choose staff development workshops for District
-
wide 
implementation and supplemental school
-
level activities.
