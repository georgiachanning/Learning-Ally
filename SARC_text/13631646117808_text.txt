About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District 
maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct 
inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a 
timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient ser
vice and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the 
school office or at
 
the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 

 
The district does not participate in the State School Deferred 
Maintenance Program. The program was eliminated in 2010
-
11. The district 
does allocated funds to Routine Restricted Maintenance account which is designed to fund district expenditures for major repa
ir or 
replacement of existing school building components. 
Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. School facilities are situated on 20 acres. Th
e school
 
buildings span 25,863 
square feet, consisting of 26 permanent classrooms, 14 portables, an administration building, library, cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room, staff room, 2 work 
rooms, and P.E. area. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning throug
h its ample classroom and recreation space. The table shows the results 
of the most recent school facilities inspection.

Parents and the community a
re very supportive of the educational program at T. L. Waggoner Elementary School. The school encourages parents to 

-
sponsored activities. Our School Sit
e Council 
meets regularly and welcomes the participation of parents. The administration holds Title 1 meetings to discuss program impro
vement, parent 
involvement, and academic achievement. Our ELAC program holds regular meetings to discuss resources for ou
r English Language Learners and to provide 
inclusion to school discussions. Council members continue to create opportunities for more parent engagement. The PTO organiz
ed in 2004 is currently 
lead by Teresa Penuela, President. Our PTO board is committed to
 
providing supplemental resources to our students.
 
 
T. L. Waggoner Elementary School welcomes parents and the community to activities held throughout the year. Each grade level 
organizes a parent night 
focused on academic resources to support learning at h
ome. School events include Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, Family Night, the Fifth Grade Wax 
Museum, the Fourth Grade Mission Project Presentation, Wrangler Round

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of T. L. Waggoner Elementary School. The school has a clos
ed campus; all visitors must sign in at the 
front office and wear an identification badge while on school grounds. Student Supervision Aides are on duty before and after
 
school and during recess 
and lunch periods to ensure a safe and orderly environment. A
 
security officer monitors campus safety since 2014. A Student Resource Officer works 
with the administration to support students and parents. In addition, we have a safety patrol program that allows students th
e opportunity to take 
ownership of school saf
ety before and after school.
 
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each 
school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies relate
d to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to
 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and 
updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed by school 
and district staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. The plan was last updated and reviewed by school staff in N
ovember 2019.

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at 
both the district and individual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff. The district offers six staff development days annually where staff members a
re offered professional growth 
opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, a
nd methodologies.  In addition, staff meetings provide collaboration time for educational development.
 
 
All curriculum development in the Imperial Unified School District revolves around the California State Content Standards. Te
achers align curriculum to 
ensure that all students either meet or exceed state proficiency levels. The writing and implementation of the curriculum is 
an ongoing process. 
Curriculum guides are updated regularly to align with the state standards, district goals, and the statewide as
sessment program.
 
 
Curriculum planning occurs through careful review of district standards, state frameworks, and district policies; a review of
 
STAR testing results and 
district multiple measures; and the most recent educational research.
 
Teachers belong 
to professional organizations to acquire and share knowledge regarding recent instructional trends, developments, and improve
ments.
