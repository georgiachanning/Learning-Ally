School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Lake Center Middle School is a part of the Little Lake City School District located in Santa Fe Springs, 
California. We are one of two middle schools in the district serving grades 6
-
8 and are the receiving 
or partner school to four (Cresson, Jersey, Lakel
and, Lakeview) of the seven elementary schools.
 
 
Lake Center Middle School has been a central part of the Santa Fe Springs Community for over 50 
years.  Many students' parents and grandparents attended Lake Center themselves when they were 
middle 
school students.  The Lake Center staff does an excellent job helping students successfully 
make the move from elementary school to middle school and then preparing these students to be 
successful at the high school level and beyond.
 
 
Lake Center is a lear
ning community with excellent teachers, wonderful students and a very 
supportive parent community. Our school community values positive academic and social growth, 
believes in a rigorous well
-
rounded education, values diversity, and looks out for the best 
interest 
of children. As our mission statement says, "With a focus on learning, the Lake Center community 
will provide high quality, well
-
rounded instructional experiences to support student success every 
period, every day."  As a result of our shared effo
rts, Lake Center was recently recognized as a 2019 
PBIS Gold School, 2018 National School to Watch re
-
designation, 2015 Gold Ribbon School, 2015 
Title I Achieving School and 2018 Honor Roll for California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE).
 
 
In recen
t parent survey results, almost 90% of respondents agreed with the statement, "In general, 
I am satisfied with my child's school," and the statement, "I am pleased with the progress my child 
is making toward meeting state standards."

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lake Center Middle School takes a great deal of pride in the facility and the campus. The school was built in the late 1950s,
 
is in excellent condition, and 
is maintained to ensure that
 
teaching and learning occurs on a high level. Administration regularly tours the facility to inspect and ensure that the 
buildings are in satisfactory condition.
 
 
In 2013 the Physical Education locker rooms were completely renovated, classrooms in the 200
 
wing were also renovated. In addition, new exterior 
lighting  was installed throughout the campus.  Wireless internet access was also installed throughout campus. In 2014 all cl
assrooms and restrooms 
were renovated along with exterior doors being replaced
.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structur
al integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it 
and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

The School Site Council 

ish Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Supports team and Music Club are all opportunities available for parent involvement and support.  Further, particular classes
 
and subject areas such as 
Advancement Via Individual Det
ermination (AVID) and science have evening parent events.  Our evening parent events are partially supported through 
our Supplemental Concentration and Title I funds.  We consult with parents about these expenditures through our School Site C
ouncil, Englis
h Language 
Advisory Committee, or by appointment.
 
 
Parents learn about these opportunities through the TeleParent automated phone dialer, the school website, letters and notice
s sent home, and on the 
marquee in front of the school. We urge community member

education. Also, there are a variety of Parent Training and Parent Education classes through the City of Santa Fe Springs, No
rwalk, and our District offered 
throu
ghout the year.
 
 
In recent parent survey results, 92% of respondents agreed with the statement, "I feel welcomed by staff when I visit the sch
ool."

School Safety Plan
 
Little Lake City School District and Lake Center Middle School considers the safety of students, staff, and the 
community to be of utmost importance. To 
that end, the school district and Lake Center Middle School update safety plans on a yearly basis. Each month, we conduct eme
rgency drills to ensure 
that all of our students and staff know exactly what to do in case
 
of an emergency. Fire drills, duck and cover drills, and even emergency lock down drills 
are rehearsed to ensure the safety of the Lake Center community. Twice each year, district
-
wide disaster drills are conducted that include emergency 
scenarios, like t
oxic gasses and huge earthquakes.
 
 
All staff members (teachers, administration, front office, custodial, cafeteria, etc.) have received "No Bully" training. Thi
s comprehensive training has 
given us all the tools to recognize and address campus bullying.  In addition, a core of staff members
 
received further training to become campus "No 
Bully" Solution Coaches.  These teams are used to help students peacefully resolve bullying issues that occur here on campus.
  
Moreover, students can 
utilize a range of reporting systems to inform staff membe
rs if they have concerns such as an online reporting system through our website, "Bully Box" 
for reporting situations, or they can consult with a teacher or staff member.  This year, we have added Restorative Circles t
o our system of interventions 
to suppo
rt the social and emotional well being of our students.  In addition, our students participate in social

The staff at Lake Center participates in professional development throughout the year.  Three professional development days a
re organized by the LLCSD 
Educational Services office.  This year, teachers were trained in Depth of Knowledge (DOK)and applying th
e rigor for each DOK level in their classrooms. 
In addition, our science teachers continue to work with UCLA to refine lessons and provide real
-
world experiences for children.  Our math teachers work 
with our district experts to refine learning experiences
 
for children.  This assists our ongoing efforts to refine our instruction.  Moreover, our teachers 
regularly collaborate 2 days per week to design lessons and activities that are in alignment with Common Core state standards
.  These lessons increase 
the l
evel of inquiry, collaboration, citing of textual evidence, primary source referencing, writing,  practical applications of c
ontent and critical reading.  
These goals are further supported by our 1:1 ratio of Chromebooks in every classroom for every studen
t.  Technology is integrated into all aspects of 
classroom lessons to add depth to each activity.
 
 
Prior to Common Core, Lake Center staff participated in a great deal of training in Effective Instruction.  Teachers were tra

t

become standard practice 
here at Lake Center and have been naturally embedded into Common Core lessons.
 
 
As we move forward in 2019
-
2020, we continue to support our teachers through professional development.  Lake Center teachers regularly attend 
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) workshops where they further enhance their instructional delivery practices. 
 
One of these p
ractices 
is using Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and Reading (WICOR) across all subject matters.  During this school y
ear, we are focusing on the 
WICOR strategies with particular emphasis on focused note taking, using notes as an instructio
nal tool, and responding in writing about those notes or 
class essential questions.  Our professional development activities and their implementation, are monitored through Data Refl
ection Sessions 5 times 
per year.  To help our teachers grow professionall
y as a team, Lake Center plans multiple site directed professional development sessions that cover such 
topics as PBIS, Special Education, LCAP,  and the concept of rigor/depth of knowledge.  Moreover, our Site Academic Leadershi
p Team (SALT) provides 
supp
ort and additional professional development to staff.  Our ability to continuously improve our practices with additional mate
rials and professional 
development is generously supported through Supplemental Concentration funding.

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
.
