School Description
 
 
School Vision
 
The Pleasant Elementary School Staff believes that each student can learn to their fullest potential 
and grow 
academically as well as socio
-
emotionally.
 
 
School Mission
 
The mission of Pleasant Elementary School is to ensure all students experience success 
academically, socially, morally, and physically. Pleasant Elementary School staff members utilize 
current, sta
ndards
-
based curriculum and instructional strategies/practices to improve academic 
achievement. Staff members use Character Counts! as a common language to develop students' 
abilities in demonstrating character and responsibility for themselves and their c
ommunity. Staff, 
parents, and students work well together to provide a climate that empowers everyone in an effort 
to maximize learning.  Pleasant Elementary students believe that "Bears C.L.I.M.B. with Character" 
(Caring, Listen, Integrity, Manners, Brill
iant).
 
 
Annual Schoolwide Plan Review
 
Data shows that Pleasant students are performing at a comparable level to the district average; 
however, scores show that many standards are not yet met across all grade levels according to 
state expectations.
 
 
The Ple
asant School Plan for Student Achievement is aligned with the Tulare City School District 
LCAP Plan. The school plan is revised during this school year to reflect the current needs 
assessment. The plan reflects the most recent state and federal accountabil
ity data and the goals 
we as educators strive to obtain. This plan was developed collaboratively with staff and members 
of the school community. It is the guide that is used for budget expenditures and instructional 
program implementation. The Pleasant Ele
mentary School Plan for Student Achievement is 
updated yearly.
 
 
Academic growth of English Language Learners is an educational focus at Pleasant Elementary. The 
plan to improve skills for these students is to implement a rigorous intervention program both 
during the school day and after school for targeted students. Teachers are aware of the need and 
implement strategic teaching practices to assist students in the acquisition of the English language. 
As a school, we are also focused on improving standards b
ased instruction across all content areas, 
focusing on each student growing at individual levels.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains infor
mation about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how th
ey intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
All school district facilities are supportive of teaching and learning. Classrooms are clean and orderly and provide a safe l
earning environment reflective 
of student work and current curriculum. The school cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room provides students a 
breakfast and lunch program. The cafeteria is used 
as a multi
-
purpose facility for large
-
scale programs and meetings. The school library provides students with supplemental reading materials and provides 
additional educational resources. The school grounds
 
are kept clean and well
-
maintained for student play, recreation, and athletic activities. Pleasant 
staff members take pride in the well
-
maintained buildings and landscaping. The Tulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe 
an
d clean environment throughout the school year. Students, staff, and parent volunteers are committed to keeping the campus cl
ean and litter free. 
The Tulare City School District provides ongoing maintenance and routine repairs to all permanent and portable
 
buildings to guarantee all schools in the 
district are in good working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for pupils are maintained so they 
are functional and meet local 
hygiene standards generally applicable to public facilitie
s, including operational toilets and sinks in all restrooms. The district has established a facilities 
inspection system to ensure that all school buildings meet the standards listed above. The school grounds, buildings, and res
trooms are kept clean, safe,
 
and regularly maintained by the morning custodian (from 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.) and the evening custodian (from 12:30 P.M. to
 
9:00 P.M.) Custodians 
are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building principal and a director of custodians to make sure t
hat all schools are safely maintained and 
cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, the district has a general maintenance crew that takes care of the mo
re technical repairs 
(plumbing, heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, painting, m
ajor repairs, and so on). At times, the district will hire an independent contractor to 

as a work order repair 
procedure that begin
s with the school principal referring needed repairs that cannot be taken care of by the site custodians to the district supe
rintendent. 
The superintendent assigns the repairs to the maintenance director who, in turn, assigns the work out to the different 
maintenance specialists. Work 
orders are completed on a timely basis. Each school  has a school site safety representative that attends ongoing safety meet
ings. The school district also 

s with the District Superintendent to discuss questions or concerns. Pleasant 
Elementary School opened in 1987. There are seven separate structures including one multipurpose/cafeteria building, one offi
ce/support staff building, 
and five separate classroo
m wings. All buildings are in exceptional condition and are maintained on a regular basis. The entire campus encompasses 
44,401 square feet. Pleasant Elementary is a one
-
level structure, therefore no ramps are present and the campus is accessible to all. T
he school library 
houses 23,557 books for check out to staff, students, and parents. Pleasant School has 93 computers in classrooms that are us
ed for instructional 
purposes. Sixty
-
five of the computers on campus have Internet access. During the summer of 2
005, the roofs of all buildings (except the multi
-
purpose/cafeteria and the 100 wing) were remodeled and each of those also received new air conditioning units. School playgro
unds are in good working 
conditions but will continue to be updated over the next
 
year to promote safety for all students.

Pleasant Elementary School supports TCSD Priority # 3: Connecting to the Local and Global Community.  Pleasant students and s
taff are involved in a 
variety of activities to involve families and the community.  We also encourage all parents
 
and members of the community to become actively involved 
at Pleasant Elementary. Classroom volunteers, Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), School Site Council (SSC), English Learner A
dvisory Committee (ELAC), 
and Migrant Parent Advisory Committee are just 
a few of the ways parents/guardians and school community members can make a difference. We are 
implementing a Parent Involvement Committee this year to create more opportunities for parents including information meetings
 
as well as fun events 
to enjoy with
 
their students.  Parents also make a difference at Pleasant Elementary by participating in school functions, classroom activi
ties, and by 
assisting teachers in the supervision of students while on field trips. The Pleasant staff is grateful to all adults 
who volunteer in any capacity. For more 
information on how to become involved, contact Tara Houston, Principal, at (559) 685
