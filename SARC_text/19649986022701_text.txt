About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Our professional development focuses on providing support for our new and returning teachers.  The Teacher Induction program 
provides support 
through mentor teachers to our first and second year teachers.  All 
teachers continue to receive training in Professional Learning Communities (PLC), 
Technology, Curriculum, Next Gen Math, Illuminate, Constructing Meaning (CM) and Systematic ELD instructions.  All through th
e year teachers attended 
workshops that focused o
n the use of Chromebooks and Interactive Flat Panels (IFP) in classroom instruction.  Our teachers on special assignment (TOS
As) 
continue to provide support in the areas of Technology, Arts Integration, NGSS, Physical Education, Systematic ELD and academ
ic
 
vocabulary instruction.  
We continue to work on our understanding of the new California Standards.  We are paying special attention to Mathematics, th
rough an understanding 
of the scope and content of the targets, the depth of knowledge (DOK) level(s) for
 
each target and assessment/mastery evidence required for each target.  
We are also working on a coherent sequence of instruction of the ELA standards.  In addition to these professional developmen
t opportunities, the 

 
professional development days and weekly collaborative instructional planning times.
