By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
West Orange Elementary School is one of 27 elementary schools in the Orange Unified School district. We are located in 
a residential area consisting primarily of single
-
family detached homes 
and apartments in the area of Main St. and 
Chapman Ave. in the city of Orange. There are 390 students enrolled in Transitional Kindergarten through 5th grade during 
the 2019/2020 school year. West Orange maintains a traditional school calendar.
 
 
The origin
al school site was built in 1890 and the existing permanent structure was built in 1949. The West Orange School 
community is committed to establishing an environment of quality learning. Teachers align instruction and assessments 
with the California State 
Content Standards. The students are challenged to reach their full potential in order to be 
productive citizens in a global society.
 
 
West Orange Elementary takes a child
-
centered approach to education. Every child has the capacity to learn and the 
right 
to the best possible education. Instruction is differentiated to meet the individual student's needs and learning styles. 
West Orange has a diagnostic Response to Intervention and Instruction system in place where every student is given a 
universal s
creening assessment three times per year. The results of these assessments guide teachers in forming 
homogeneous groups where the specific needs of each student are addressed during a scheduled intervention time five 
days a week for 30 minutes in language 
arts. In addition, West Orange Elementary has developed a math intervention 
program that focuses on developing a students skill in communicating reasoning and problem solving through a variety of 
strategies such as number talks. 
 
 
West Orange continues to 
excel in academics and exceed the State's academic targets. We are committed to creating a 
safe and caring environment that fosters the intellectual, social, emotional and physical growth of each student. The 
development of literacy, critical thinking, and
 
problem solving skills are crucial to the success of our students as we focus 
on vocabulary development and reading comprehension. 
 
 
The West Orange staff has worked diligently and efficiently in order for our community to be favorably impressed by the 
qu
ality of instructional program and our desire to prepare responsible individuals to develop excellence. West Orange was 
selected by the California State Department of Education to receive the Gold Ribbon School Award in 2016 as well as the 
Title I Academic
 
Achievement Award in recognition of the West Orange WIN program. It is our goal to do whatever it takes 
to promote continuous and sustained academic achievement for every student at West Orange.
 
 
Vision:
 
 
West Orange Elementary School will strive for 
academic excellence by providing all students a meaningful and rigorous 
learning experience in order to develop the intellectual, creative, social, emotional, technological, and physical skills 
necessary to prepare them for the next phase of their lives.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

West Orange 
Elementary School strives to involve parents in all aspects of the school program, which include an active 
school site council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), parent education classes, and the West Orange 
School Association (WOSA).
 
 
The 
West Orange School Association parent organization works to provide a better education for our students. They 
sponsor study trips, assemblies, parent training, summer enrichment programs and funds for the library. Our parent group 
works in conjunction with
 
our teachers, Associative Student Body and school Administration in order to enrich the 
academic and school culture of West Orange elementary school.
 
 
We have many parents who volunteer in the classroom and throughout campus regularly. Parents are an inte
gral part of 
the school community and are encouraged to participate in daily school activities.  Each year their volunteer service is 
honored at our Annual Volunteer Appreciation tribute.
 
 
West Orange also provides a Family Library and STEAM Night twice a 
month  where parents can read with their children, 
check
-
out books, and engage STEAM activities.
 
 
West Orange elementary is constantly seeking to strengthen our home
-
school connection, and parents are encouraged 
to participate as often as possible. The rol
e that parents and the community play are vital to our success.

y radio contact system, and district radio drills are held 
periodically to be prepared in case of an actual disaster. Noon duty supervisors are hired to supervise lunch and playground 
activities in order to maintain a safe, organized, and supervised lunch 
time. The principal meets with supervisors and staff 
on a regular basis to monitor concerns and changes to the duty and safety plan. In compliance with SB 187, the West
