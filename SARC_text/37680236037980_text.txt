School Description
 
Mueller Charter School (MCS) is a TK
-
12 school, currently enjoying its 25th year as a charter.  
Though we are independent of the Chula Vista Elementary School District, we participate in all state 
and local assessment time
-
lines and systems.  As such, we h
ave continued to meet expected targets 
and have made steady gains in academic performance.  In 2008, we were named a "Title I Academic 
Award Winning School" by the California Department of Education. In 2009, we were awarded a 
"Golden Bell" by the Californ
ia School Boards Association for our work in student wellness. And the 
California Business for Education Excellence listed MCS on the "Honor Roll" of high performing 
schools in 2009, 2010, and 2011. In 2012, Mueller was a recipient of the "National Urban S
chool 
Transformation Award," one of only four K
-
8 schools so designated in the United States. During the 
2019 school year Mueller Charter School was recognized as a California Distinguished School.
 
 
MCS is a fiscally independent charter school among 46 
elementary schools of the Chula Vista 
Elementary School District.   Located 7 miles north of the Mexico/California border, MCS was built 
in 1953 and consists of TK
-
12 regular education classrooms. MCS operates on an extended, year
-
round schedule, during wh
ich our students attend school for 196 instructional days.
 
 
MCS enrollment is over  1540 students.  Approximately 90% live in apartment complexes within 
walking distance of the school.  A large percentage of the population comes from single parent 
families
 
with considerable economic need. About 75% qualify for the federal free or reduced
-
price 
meal program.  Over half the children enrolled in regular education are Title 1 students, with nearly 
60% learning English as a second language.
 
 
As a charter, we are
 
guided by the provisions of our Charter Petition.  The mission of our charter 
school is to provide a strong, rigorous academic program that will contribute to a minimum of 90% 
of our students demonstrating grade level competency.  Students are monitored t
hroughout the 
school year, primarily by the computer
-
based MAPS system, developed by the Northwest 

provided an engaging, integrated curriculum that features writ
ing, science, social studies, the arts 
and physical fitness.   Mueller Charter School is well on the way to a complete transition to Common 
Core State Standards and the higher expectations and levels of rigor required in that effort.
 
 
This document describ
es the goals of our school program, the instructional strategies that we 
employ, the role of parents and community, the support services provided for our children, and 
other critical features of our school.  While we are a fiscally independent charter scho
ol, we are 
accountable for both our fiscal viability and our ability to engender extraordinary academic results 
for our students. A copy of our Charter Petition is available in our school office and on our website.
 
 
Mission and Vision
 
Our charter petition 
states that:
 
 
At MCS, we believe that every student has the potential to change the world.  We believe that if a 
future president, a master engineer, a concert cellist, a ground breaking oncologist, a space 
pioneer, a Nobel award winner

is currently sittin
g in a classroom somewhere in America, he or 
she might just as well be at Mueller Charter School. Our children will change the world.
 
 
We believe that every student has unlimited potential for learning.

We believe that we can create K through 12 organization that is a national mod
el in its ability to meet the complex needs of our children 
and their families, to offer exciting and challenging learning experiences, and to engender extraordinary academic results by
 
any measure.
 
 
We believe that we can create opportunities for genuine 
parent governance and participation, and create options in which the community 
can become inextricably linked with the mission of our school.
 
 
We believe that we have the ability, the will, the opportunity and the obligation to re
-
invent the institution of
 
schools, to challenge the 

 
 
We believe that our students will change the world.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

adership roles in our charter school.  The governing body that is comprised of parents is the Charter Board, 
and additionally parents serve on the Parent Council. They work closely with the Executive Director & the Principal and are t
asked with four primar
y 
goals: 1) Monitor and review the implementation of the charter petition; 2) Monitor the progress of our school in achieving t
he goals of our charter 
petition; 3) Improve communication between home and school; and 4) Address priorities identified from the
 
Harris Interactive Survey.
 
 
Parent Council:
 
Mueller Charter School maintains an active Parent Council which participates in school
-
wide events including the Fall Festival, Fiesta Night, Olympic 
Festival, Family Reading Nights, Book Fairs and
 
Parent Nights
.

Every 
employee is required to establish 3 to 5 professional goals every year, one of which must address efforts to improve their qu
ality of service and to 
contribute to the overall charter goal of getting 90% of our students to grade level. Teachers collaborate 
with colleagues and with the principal in an 
effort to achieve their professional goals. Teachers identify resources, training, and release time that they need to achieve
 
their goals. The principal 
monitors and observes in every classroom on a regular basi
s and provides on
-
going feedback. All staff members complete a self
-
reflection at years end 
to highlight professional growth, as well as areas that will require continued improvement and attention.
 
 
As a staff, teachers participate in professional developm
ent on a weekly basis. On
-
going themes and teacher development training continue to address:

Career Technical Education Programs
 
Currently Bayfront Charter High School offers 2 CTE aligned courses: 1) Forensic Science and 2) English 12: Memories of War. 
 
Both courses fall under the 
CTE Sector of Public Services and CTE Pathway of Legal Practices.  Bayfront is working towards creatin
g a CTE Pathway for its students.
 
 
ENGLISH 12: Memories of War
 
This course will focus on the stories of survivors of war, and students will learn about non
-
profit organizations in their community who assist immigrants 
and refugees.  Students will read worl
d literature including plays, biographical fiction, and memoirs related to war and conflict. They will work with essay 
writing, script writing, and poetry, as well as professional correspondence with local non
-
profit organizations. Students will learn the 
history of displaced 
groups in their community, how non
-
profits serve the needs of those groups, how non
-
profits function as a business, and what volunteer opportunities 
are available to students.
 
 
FORENSIC SCIENCE:
 
In this course students study biology an
d earth science by engaging in investigations of how scientific evidence is used to solve crimes. Students take on 
the roles of public safety professionals to identify, collect, preserve, test, and analyze physical evidence.  Each unit of t
his course asks 
how physical 
evidence can be used to solve a type of crime, and students explain and explore the scientific principles at work. Students l
earn not only how and why 
evidence can be used to solve crime, but also how biogeological processes affect the preserv
ation and viability of physical evidence. Professional report 
writing is emphasized in this course, reflecting the high frequency and importance of writing reports in public safety career
s. Throughout this course, 
students will collect and analyze evidence
 
from simulated crime scenes. The course culminates with students using physical evidence to solve a simulated 
homicide and delivering expert testimony in a simulated murder trial.
 
 
These classes are both approved through the University of California and a
re recognized as UC a
-
g approved courses that align with CTE standards.  
Bayfront's Forensic Science course was adopted from the University of California Curriculum Integration (UCCI).  UCCI focuses
 
on assisting high schools 
with the development and implem
entation of integrated courses that unite academic study with Career Technical Education.  Bayfront's Forensic Science 
course helps fulfill the "D" Lab Science requirement for graduation.  Students elect to take this course. Bayfront's English 
12: Memories
 
of War is also 
embedded into one of Bayfront's graduation requirement; more specifically this course meets the "B" English requirement for g
raduation.  All seniors 
take this course prior to graduation.
 
 
In addition to offering 9th and 11th grade college v
isits for its students, Bayfront has a partnership with Junior Achievement.  Through this partnership 
and the work of our school counselors, all students take career assessments, receive 5 classroom lessons on topics including 
career exploration and 
intere
st, financial literacy.  Student also receive information relevant to San Diego County's job market.  In addition to these se
rvices, SPED students have 
Individualized Transitional Plans which focus on post
-
secondary transitions.  Our SPED students also vis
it local businesses to learn about job opportunities 
available within the community.
 
 
Bayfront uses course completion/passing rates and teacher and department feedback to evaluate the effectiveness of its course
s.  Bayfront also has an 
Instructional Leader
ship Team (ILT) which observes teaching and learning in all of Bayfront's classes, including the 2 mentioned above.
 
 
 
Dr. Ryan Santos is the primary representative for CTE at Bayfront Charter High School.  As mentioned earlier, Bayfront offers
 
2 CTE aligne
d courses but is 
in the process of developing CTE Pathways for its students.
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enr
ollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print 
documents.
