The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 
November 1988.  The SARC, to be issued annually by local boards for each elementary and secondary school in the
 
State, 
provides parents and other interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the
 
areas in which improvements are needed.
 
 
Fairgrove Elementary School is located on the central coast of California.  It is
 
one of eleven elementary schools in the Lucia 
Mar Unified School District.  Fairgrove serves 455 transitional kindergarten through sixth
-
grade students.  Fairgrove 
Elementary School also hosts for the San Luis Obispo County Office of Education Deaf/Hard o
f Hearing Program.  While the 
Deaf
-
Hard of Hearing Program is independent of the instructional program provided at Fairgrove, some students are 
mainstreamed in general education classrooms.  The entire Fairgrove Elementary School Community is honored to ho
st this 
unique and special program.  Fairgrove Elementary embraces the Lucia Mar Unified School District mission statement to 

-
aligned 
academic pro
gram based on the current California Content Standards.  Fairgrove Elementary staff is dedicated to school 
improvement and meeting the needs of all Fairgrove Elementary School students.  Fairgrove Elementary is a diverse learning 
community where students l
earn

it is also a school where teachers learn too.  Fairgrove Elementary staff value effective 
professional development that is job
-
embedded, site
-
specific, data
-
driven, and based on the needs of both teachers and 
students.  Teachers are provided ongoing p
rofessional development sessions in both grade
-
level and whole
-
school settings 
and work collaboratively in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to analyze student achievement using data from 
multiple common assessments.   A central tenet of the Profess
ional Learning Community (PLC) System at Fairgrove 
Elementary is that it be aligned to the California Common Content Standards and field tested to ensure efficacy prior to 
being presented in professional development sessions.  Fairgrove Elementary School h
as implemented a PLC System aligned 

 
governing boards of both LMUSD and San Luis Obispo County Office of Education.  Professional d
evelopment in grade
-
level 
PLC sessions for 2019
-
2020 is aligned to the California Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and 

Fairg
rove Elementary for several years and have aided students in developing their metacognitive skills.  The Fairgrove 
Elementary staff is in its fifth year of implementing Thinking Maps Write from the Beginning ... and Beyond, a writing 
program aligned to Thi
nking Maps and designed specifically for elementary school students.  Three additional curricular 
areas of focus for 2019
-
2020 include assisting students in better understanding how to complete English Language Arts and 
mathematics performance tasks, devel
oping students' mathematics skills through the full implementation of "Number 
Corner" and "Number Talks", and providing teachers training on best practices in using technology for 
instruction/assessment.  Fairgrove Elementary benefits greatly from a partne
rship with Cal Poly State University, San Luis 
Obispo.  Many collegiate students have volunteered to work in classrooms or assist with Fairgrove Elementary School's 
Family STEM Night.
 
 
In addition to a professional development system, Fairgrove Elementary 
has implemented additional programs for students, 
staff, and the larger school community.  During the 2016
-
2017 school year, the entire school implemented The Daily 5, a 
framework for structuring literacy time to assist students in improving reading and wr
iting skills.  Teachers worked 
individually and collaboratively with grade
-
level peers to effectively implement The Daily 5 to help their students develop 

 


-
2018 school year, the entire school 

-
reading instructi
on 
and conferring with students.  The system helps students understand and master four key components of successful reading:  
comprehension, accuracy, fluency, and expanding vocabulary.  The implementation of The Daily 5 (structure) and The 

System have significantly impacted the reading instruction program at Fairgrove for all students in grades 
TK through six.
 
 
Fairgrove Elementary offers several enrichment opportunities.  Gifted and talented students work on special projects, in 
language ar
ts, mathematics, science, and technology. Students in grades TK, K, 1, 2, 4, and 5 receive weekly music instruction 
sponsored by both Fairgrove Elementary School's Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) and Lucia Mar Unified School District.  
Students in grade 
six may participate in the band program sponsored by Lucia Mar Unified School District if interested.  
Students also participate in a variety of field trips appropriate to their grade level and curricular focus.  During the 2017
-
2018 school year, the staff
 
at Fairgrove Elementary created and implemented "Exploration Pathways"
--
a unique 
instructional program designed to allow students opportunities to explore different mini
-
elective courses throughout the 
school year.  All teachers created an "Exploration Pa
thway" designed to introduce students to some of the 15 Career 
Technical Education Industry Sectors outlined in California's Career Technical Education Model Curriculum Standards.  There 
are three Exploration Pathways sessions scheduled for 2019
-
2020.  Eac
h is comprised of four individual one
-
hour sessions.  
Courses include introduction to Breakout Edu, Coding, and Visual and Performing Arts.

teams to analyze and discuss 
individual student progress.  Students who experience difficulties with grade
-
level instruction are placed in small intervention groups or invited to attend after
-
school 
assistance programs such as Rosetta Stone for English Le
arners, homework groups, and individual teacher tutoring.  Fairgrove Elementary utilizes Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) to address behavioral concerns.  A school
-
wide Positive Behavioral Support System was implemented in the 2018
-
201
9 school year.  The 
"RICE System" is an expansion of a student
-
led initiative at Fairgrove Elementary School and is based on four attributes:  Respect, Integrity, Cooperation, and Empathy.
  
Staff 
members and Fairgrove Leadership Council (FLC) students reco
gnize positive behaviors.  Students receive a "RICE Slip" in acknowledgment for demonstrating one of the 
four key attributes of a quality Fairgrove student.  Students share the information with their families and are eligible to p
articipate in prize drawin
gs.  At the end of each 
trimester, teachers select and acknowledge four students who represent one of the key attributes in trimester assemblies.  De
pending on the success of academic and 
behavioral interventions, students may be recommended to Fairgrove E

grades is Second Step, a program aligned to RTI and PBIS that assists teachers in integrating social
-
emotional learning into their classrooms.  Fairgrove El
ementary also hosts 
parent or family nights during which parents are provided information about general school expectations and opportunities for
 
families to explore/engage in activities 
aligned to California Content Standards particularly in the areas of 
reading and mathematics.
 
 
Our learning community takes great pride in the academic successes of our students.  The extended Fairgrove Elementary School
 
Community includes an active Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO) which hosts several school community even
ts including assemblies and family nights.  The PTO also fundraises on behalf of the school to provide 
support to staff and students by providing enrichment programs, field trips, and music instruction in grades TK
-
2.  Fairgrove is also fortunate to have p
arents volunteer 
weekly in classrooms.  All staff members greatly value parent participation in the school program.
 
 
There are many indicators of success in this SARC.  Please call our school office if you wish to participate in any organized
 
opportunities
 
for parent involvement or if you 
have any questions about the contents of this report.
 
 
Fairgrove Elementary School's Mission Statement:  To engage, challenge, and inspire students through the power of learning.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year,
 
every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) a
ll local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities
. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Fairgrove 
Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for learning.  Built in 1962 and modernized in 2002, Fairgrove Elementar
y School is 
situated on 9.4 acres.  The school buildings span 40,273 square feet, consisting of 29 classrooms, the Learning Center,
 
administration offices, and a multi
-
purpose room with a kitchen.  The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground
 
space.
 
 
In the Summer of 2017,  the front sidewalks and the side parking lot were replaced/re
paved.  A sewer replacement and data/comm infastructure upgrade 
will be completed in 2018.  A new Outdoor Learning Center is in the planning stage, and specs are being created for a new wat
er supply.
 
 
Fairgrove Elementary School is a closed campus.  Many p
eople visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events.  Parents 
and visitors are welcomed and required to check
-

school
 
office upon departure.  During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults supervise students and school grounds, su
ch as the cafeteria 
and recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 priority of main
tenance and operations.  District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at school 
sites on a continual basis.  Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely 
manner.  A work
-
order 
pro
cess is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  The District maintenance
 
staff has indicated that 
100 percent of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.  A team of custodians ensures classroo
ms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept 
clean and safe.  A scheduled maintenance program is administered by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all clas
srooms and facilities are 
well maintained and provide a suitable learning environment.  
A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which i
ncludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleve
n. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabili
ties); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan 
prov
ides students and 
staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 
within their Safe School 
Plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster proced
ures, both routine and emergency; policies related to suspension 
and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egr
ess of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly sch
ool environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are reviewed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each
 
school year. The Injury, Illness & Prevention Plan was last updated and reviewed with school staff in 
November 2018.
 
 
Fairgrove Elementary's 2019 Comprehensive School Safety Plan was adopted by Fairgrove's Schoolsite Council on October 23, 201

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing wor
kforce technology and employment environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students grad
uating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessary f
or success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career 
Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, trade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school, college and te
chnical training 
environments. This resulted in the need to dev
elop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engages participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opportunities within a specific industry sector. High Scho
ol Career Pathways provi
de 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario. 
 
 
Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one industry certification, or equivalent s
kill measurement, to provide 
a competitive
 
advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate and associate d
egree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and in some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while s
till in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Education 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Care
er Technical Education, which was adopted by the State Board of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of career pathway programs of study 
for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway 
preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with industry members and assem
bling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewing and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining o
utreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs. 
 
 
The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway programs, and site administration in the areas of curricu
lum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by attending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally,
 
CTE instructors focus on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affect
s the structural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued
 
to improve annually in the support of current programs that are functioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from programs that currently function as a single co
urse, and establish new 
programs where
 
programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions through the Futu
re Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Art
s, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had regional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Industry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid
, Food Handlers, Serv Safe
, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and som
e pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Additionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique project
s that demonstrate their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are a
ble to gain real world 
experience within their field of study that often times leads to
 
employment.

Addressing the CTE needs of all students
 
 
All ninth
-
grade students have the 

explore career options, develop academic plans, and learn about post
-
secondary educational and training opportunities. Students may develop a
dvanced 
skills and receive industry
-
standard training by participating in the various vocational/technical courses at all sites. These courses prepare students f
or 
future college coursework and entry
-
level job opportunities.
 
 
Evaluating CTE Programs
 
 
Each 
CTE Pathway maintains an active business advisory committee that evaluates the program. In addition, school and district admi
nistrators monitor 
the program and instructors effectiveness on an annual basis. All CTE Pathways require a two
-
 
or three
-
course ar
ticulated curriculum that will meet job 
market expectations providing students with a minimum of 300 hours of industry specific curriculum aligned to both post
-
secondary education options 
and high demand, high wage careers.
