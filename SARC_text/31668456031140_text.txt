School Description
 
 
District & School Profile:
 
The Loomis Union School District is located in the Town of Loomis a quaint, family
-
oriented 
community. Established in 1850 and incorporated i
n 1984, Loomis retains its rural character and 
charm with its large residential lots and custom homes, an old
-
fashioned downtown, and 
woodlands with natural streams and rolling hillsides. Loomis is located about 25 miles northeast of 
Sacramento and is only
 
ten minutes from Folsom Lake and a little over an hour away from either 
Lake Tahoe or the San Francisco Bay. Loomis Union School District is comprised of six elementary 
schools and a charter school, serving students in transitional kindergarten through ei
ghth grade.
 
 
Placer Elementary is a family

oriented school with a rich and unique history that serves 
approximately 545 students in grades Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through Eighth.  Since the 

parents have worked together to empower 
all students to become responsible, respectful, engaged citizens committed to life
-
long learning.
 
 
In addition to the core academic subjects, students at Placer participate in primary music, 
instrumental music, and c
horal music programs.  Students in second through eighth grade receive 
Spanish instruction twice per week.  With the support of an active PTC, Placer students also 
participate in enrichment activities such as Starstruck Dance, Star Art Classes,  Mad Scienc

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructio

-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 5, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had suffic
ient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to 
the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Te
xtbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by a
ll teache
rs and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
