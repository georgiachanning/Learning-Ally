By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Happy Valley Primary School provides an opportunity for every student to succeed, every day.  Our school community 
provides a positive learning culture, supported by our faculty, staff, families, and community.  Many of our veteran 
teachers are 
serving second
-
generation students, providing a rich history and a promising future for our students.  While 
the ingenuity of another generation of teachers add to the talents among the faculty.  Our teachers are participating in 
ongoing professional devel
opment in the specific three goals:  academics, social and emotional learning, and a safe school 
community, and improving practices with regard to academics and social
-
emotional learning.  Our teachers are engaged 
in professional learning in the areas of I
mprovement Science, Restorative Practices, and Trauma
-
Informed Practices, 
curriculum and instruction, and differentiated instruction.  We also offer
 
Multi
-
tiered Systems of Support to serve every student according to specific needs. These practices culmina
te in a district
-
wide effort to provide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) as a framework for sustaining student
-
centered 
learning opportunities and academic and social growth.
 
 
Our families are present at community events, school assembli
es, celebrations, and support groups.  Many parents 
volunteer at our school, enhancing our students' learning experience.  Our community is involved in the effort to provide 
a safe, healthy learning environment.  Project Share provides a robust after schoo
l program that facilitates additional 
supports and quality activities to over half of our student population.  While the Citizens Patrol is routinely present at th
e 
end of the school day, merely to provide a sense of community support and school safety.  O
ur family liaison and other 
staff are encouraging parent engagement at family friendly events.
 
 
Home to 205 students, we provide quality academic experiences to students in 0
-
5
-
year
-
old programs and from TK
-
 
through third grade.  Our teachers, paraprofessi
onals, and support staff come together to offer all that a student will need 
to succeed socially and academically.  In addition, our school provides opportunities for future students and our families 
providing school readiness programs, parenting classes, 
small group support systems, and a family liaison who assists in 
various scenarios, to bridge resources and offer support to our students and their families.  We have made a concerted 
effort to connect counseling services with students who may need additio
nal supports.  Individual counseling, group 
counseling, and whole class sessions are offered by various counseling organizations, in order to address social skill 
building, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE's), and other challenging life experiences.   Wh
en students are faced with 
learning challenges, they also have the opportunity to work with a behavior coach who guides them in self
-
regulation, 
redirection and the successful return to learning.
 
 
In order to build capacity among our staff, teachers and st
aff serve on various teams that are focused on specific goals 
and concerns.  We have developed four leadership teams that focus on our district and school goals as well as a full faculty 
team that is carefully examining data and working together to align o
ur instructional practices to better serve our students.  
Focusing on three drivers for improving the system, the team believes it will have a direct effect on student learning.  The 
PBIS Team is focused, at the district level, on developing and refining a
 
district
-
wide system that will unify our school 
community around a common language and a specific plan for success and achievement.  Teachers have selected specific 
areas for professional growth and are engaged in current research and practices to improve
 
student learning.  
Paraprofessionals and support staff attend meetings regularly, to discuss concerns and build a positive program for 
supporting our students and families.  They also attend training sessions that prepare them to engage in a positive soci
al 
emotional learning environment.

In order to provide a rigorous and engaging academic experience, teachers have begun a journey to articulate current 
practices through vertical alignment.  Alongside this endeavor to connect prior knowledge to potential 
learning, teachers 
rely on data to inform instruction.  Time is spent each week, engaged in meaningful collaboration focused on differentiated 
instruction and developing specific academic skills.  Teaching teams prepare their students each day to reach the
ir full 
potential by identifying learning gaps and prescribing specific learning experiences to address student needs.
 
 
Our support staff serve with loving kindness and look out for our students and fellow site personnel.  The staff's dedication
 
to our 
students is evident in their performance each day in the unique and important role they each play at our school 
site.  The Happy Valley School Community stands proudly to support a positive learning culture for all students.

Textbook selection occurs primarily by teachers from the state

approved lists. Teachers attend presentations by 
publishers, examine the program choices, an
d may even teach lessons from the program. In the past, teachers have 
sometimes piloted a program prior to district adoption. Once the teachers have narrowed their choices, parents and the 
community are invited to examine the curriculum. The selection choi
ces are brought before the School Site Council. Final 
approval is by school board adoption.
 
 
The district meets the state guidelines for textbooks and instructional materials. The district has affirmed that each pupil,
 
including English learners, has his o
r her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Happy Valley Primary School, built between 1976 and 1979, went 
through the modernization process in the summer of 
2006. The oldest parts of the school were completely remodeled: electrical, data lines for computers, plumbing, carpets, 
wall treatments, doors, cupboards, bathrooms and fixtures. All rooms have central ai
r
-
conditioning, and the school was 
recently painted. The other half of the school was completed in the summer of 2007. Happy Valley Primary School has an 
excellent janitorial staff. The campus is kept clean and is well maintained. All sinks, toilets, and d
rinking fountains are in 
working condition. The grounds are kept mowed and free of trash. A custodian is always available to ensure a tidy and 
well
-
maintained campus.
 
 
The school has a very large playground. It has playground equipment on the first
-
third g
rade playground and also on the 
kindergarten playground. We are on a large piece of property with lots of room for the children to run and play. Our 
blacktop areas were recently resurfaced, and we have behavior coaches who guide behavior as it is outlined 
in our Positive 
Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parental involvement is always welcome. We have formed a leadership team that will focus on communication and family 
engagement.  We seek parent input through the use of surveys, monthly Site Council meetings, mon
thly Coffee with the 
Principal meetings and other conversations. Parents are welcomed and encouraged to volunteer in the classrooms. The 
School Site Council (SSC) is also an active group where parents express needs and desires for our student population. T
he 
SSC has set goals and has identified their priorities to support the goals to best meet the needs of the children. They are 

 
gat
herings.  We address specific topics and seek input from families at these events.  We also host the same event for our 
parents of English Learners.  We use culture surveys and various polls on social media to seek parental input.  Our parents 
are informed

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)  is being strengthened in a district
-
wide effort to synthesize current Readiness and 
Emergency Management Systems (REMS) practices with our local needs.  A district team has met
 
to address the specific 
plan for all functional annexes at all possible time
-
frames to assist with the development of a comprehensive plan for 
safety.  We are in the stages of completing the full revision and communicating the plan to our staff.  Basic fu
nctions will 
be addressed with parents through a variety of communication tools, such as the use of a text app, all
-
call phone calls, 
and our website.
 
 
We have strengthened the safety processes at our school site by limiting access to the school to one loc
ation.  Adults 
supervise the student drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas before and after school. Students are signed in and out at the office, and 
adults must be listed on the emergency card. Children are not allowed in the front area of the school without being 
a
ccompanied by an adult.
 
 
We have a School Safety Plan. Fire, lockdown, and earthquake drills are routinely practiced. The Emergency Procedures 
Manual identifies protocols and responsible parties for numerous types of emergencies.  The plan identifies roles
, 
responsibilities, functional annexes, how to address the situations before, during, and after any emergency situation. The 
Emergency Operations Plan/School Safety Plan is currently being updated and was last discussed with school faculty in 
January 2018.
 
Please see the district office for details.
 
 

open communication and up to date protocol. The Happy Valley Fire Department is located wit
hin a quarter
-
mile of the 
school, and it is always available to assist in medical emergencies.
 
 
The staff is trained annually in emergency procedures and has practice drills on a regular basis. The school nurse offers 
CPR/first
-
aid classes on a regular basis.  The staff was trained on specific practices at the beginning of the school
-
year.  The 
schoo
l is equipped with surveillance cameras and was recently re
-
keyed to strengthen safety practice. The parking lot, as 
well as the playground, can be observed through this video system.

The Happy Valley Union Elementary School District provides ongoing professional development opportunities. We have 
two full days dedicated to district
-
wide professional development as well as utilizing our min
imum day Monday schedule 
for one hour of professional development each week.  The major emphasis of our staff development is in the area of 
Common Core State Standards, Response to Intervention (RTI), utilizing instructional technologies, targeted instruct
ion, 
and student engagement strategies. Our focus is to improve student achievement using data, developing individual plans 
to support student learning, and monitoring student progress. Our district is committed to staff development. In addition 
to three s
taff development days, we utilize teacher release time, school workshops, and conferences to support ongoing 
learning. Teachers are supported in their professional development by participating in Differentiated Assistance, literacy 
training, trauma
-
informe
d practices, social and emotional learning and a vertical collaboration process. We are developing 
a system that uses improvement science to facilitate continuous improvement in literacy across the content areas and 
social and emotional learning.  Our LCAP
 
reflects this process in goals one and two.
