By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Stone Creek Elementary school opened in 1978 and completely modernized during the summer of 2009.  Our facility 
includes fifteen modified self
-
contained classrooms within the main building and seven relocatable classrooms 
to serve 
our student population.  Stone Creek includes a library/media center, which houses books, iPads, chromebooks and 
computers.  A separate multipurpose room is the setting for assemblies, programs, and music instruction.  In 2018 our 
school facilitie
s received upgrades to our former computer lab and library space, creating a more open library space that 
connects to a newly designed innovation lab. This project also included the addition of a design lab used for science 
purposes to our campus. In addit
ion, classrooms inside the building were upgraded with doors to increase safety by having 
lockable doors and reduce the noise level in all inside classrooms. All classrooms are connected to the internet, and l LCD 
projectors have been installed in each cla
ssroom.

We continue to focus on providing a safe environment for our students and have worked with the Irvine Police Department 
and our parent community to develop a drop off and pick up system that keeps traffic flowing more effectively in a parking 
lot 
that was never designed for the current level of use.
 
 
Supported by Maintenance and Operations staff and Grounds staff, our custodial staff is dedicated to keeping our building 
and grounds clean and safe for all students and staff.  Our playground and blac
ktop areas are well
-
maintained and 
playground equipment was recently upgraded on the main play area and the kindergarten area.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Stone Creek Elementary 
School is a neighborhood school in a community that places a high value on education and the 
importance of the home and school partnership.  Parent participation is valued and there are numerous opportunities for 
parent volunteers at Stone Creek.  We have 
parents, grandparents, and community members volunteering in classrooms, 
participating in School Site Council and PTA activities, assisting with fundraising, political action, community service, and
 
a wide range of committees which are so vital to providin
g a successful learning environment for all students.  Parents 
also have the opportunity to participate in the District English Language Advisory Committee, School SIte Council, the 
GATE Community Advisory Committee, and the Special Education Advisory Comm
ittee. We enjoy welcoming parents on 
campus for special events such as Picnic with Parents, Book Fair, STEAM Night, Back to School Night, Open House and 
Family Fun Nights.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local 
discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and 
SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic p
rograms, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary s
cience, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previo

size reduction, 10) Additional secondary sections to reduce class size, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site staffing with

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding 
equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enroll
ment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

Each year our district and school offer Professional Growth 
opportunities for all staff.  The focus of the staff development 
is around the implementation of new curriculum and/or materials, enhancing effective teaching strategies, and district 
and school
-
wide continuous improvement efforts.  This year, Stone Creek 
is focusing on the effective use of intervention 
time (WIN time), differentiation of math practices, and building resources to support students' emotional and behavioral 
needs. In addition to that, we continue our professional learning with our Common Core
 
trainings. Our PBIS  and MTSS 
teams are gaining a firmer grasp of Tier I systems, as we progress to Tier II through training with Guidance Resources at 
district level.
