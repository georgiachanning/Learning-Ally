By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the distri
ct 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this
 
survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the internet 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Fairview strives to ensure that all students are safe at school. Students are supervised in the mornings as they 
get off the 
bus, at drop
-
off, and at loading with the assistance of yard duty personnel. During the day when students are at school, 

allowe
d only for scheduled business or regular volunteers. Parent/guardian or emergency contact status is checked prior 
to check
-
out of a student with an adult. In the afternoon, students are supervised by yard duty personnel upon dismissal 
while the campus rema
ins closed to visitors throughout this time period.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A Safety Plan is in place at Fairview Elementary School and was developed with the assistance of California Safe Schools 
consulting firm and the members of the Site Safety Committee, (which includes teachers, staf
f, administration and 
parents). The plan is reviewed each year for effectiveness and can be adjusted as needed. Procedures to be followed in 
the event of any emergency at the school, or as a result of a situation in the neighborhood which may impact the sc
hool 
site, are outlined in this plan. Safety Drills are scheduled throughout the school year to train students and staff to respon
d 
in case of emergency situations such as: fire, lockdown, or evacuation of the building. Evacuation routes and pertinent 
info
rmation to assist officials to ensure student and staff safety are also included in the plan. Fairview also participates in 
the Great Shake Out each year, drawing attention to preparedness in the event of an Earthquake in conjunction with many 
schools acro
ss the state.

Professional development in MCS is data 
driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development. 
 
To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
re
lease days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades 
and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional developmen
t is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional developme
nt provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
