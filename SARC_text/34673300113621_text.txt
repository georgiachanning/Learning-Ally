By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are
 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

l education 
and general education students), a gym/multipurpose room/cafeteria, library, staff lounge, computer lab, and three 
playgrounds.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the custodial staff of three (three full
-
time) to ensure that the 
cleaning of 
the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards are available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority are give
n to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are 
reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget: The 
district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typical
ly this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

des 
steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. The school stays in compliance with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a 
monthly ba
sis throughout the school year.  Lock down drills are held several times a year, as needed. Students are 
supervised before and after school by certificated staff/classified staff/principal, and certificated staff/classified 
staff/principal supervise studen
ts during lunch. Certificated staff/classified staff help with supervision during lunch and 
break periods. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up before and after school throughout the day and 
multiple schedules.
