Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades th
ree 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the mo
st significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education seq
uences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Gasquet Mountain parents are increasingly involved in the education of their children. We have an active PTO and School 
Site Council parents that volunteer in the classroom as well as in the organization of our special events. These events 
include annual t
he Community Feast and FIeld Day on the last day of school.
 
 
Each trimester the school hosts a Student Learning Showcase. Families and the community are invited to participate in 
hands
-
on learning activities with students. This is a time for students to di
splay their learning and share how they are 
innovating and growing as learners.
 
 
Parents of Mountain Elementary School students often ask how they might participate at school.  We have found that the 
most helpful participation is offered by fully supportin
g your child's academic progress.  Studies show that when parents 
take an active interest in their child's learning, regard learning as fun and make schoolwork a priority; their children refl
ect 
that interest by high achievement, greater enjoyment and grea
ter involvement in their own learning.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to volunteer in our classrooms as often as possible. Their help allows teachers to provide 
additional time for small group and personalized instruction.    Parents may contact the office at 707
-
457
-
3211 for more 
Parent Involvement Opportunities.
 
 
To support students in the home, parents and guardians are encouraged to:
 

 
Read to your student daily for at least 15 minutes 
-
 
let your student select text that is interesting to them
 

 
Encourage your stu
dent to learn a new hobby each year such as music, sports, gardening or woodworking.
 

 
Use the Mountain School ExploreIt! activities (featured on our website and blog) to start academic discussions 
and explorations with your student
 

 
Stay informed by joining 
the Mountain Elementary Remind/Text Notification Group to receive updates on school 
events and activities (https://www.remind.com/join/mountelem)
 

 
Arrange for a quiet study place or desk time set aside each day for reading, finishing school projects or home
work 
when assigned
 

 

 

 
Participate in activities suggested by the teacher
