Like the roaring '20s, our district is poised to make some noise in 2020!
 
LEUSD student accountability showed meaningful gains with the latest California School Dashboard 
results. Positive growth in 

focus on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to provide teachers and principals with critical 
performance data to guide daily instruction, helping students succeed!
 
 

 
first new school in 12 years is greatly anticipated. Alberhill Elementary School will 
open in August of 2020. This new TK
-
5 school will feature state
-
of
-
the
-
art solar energy efficiency, 
flexible classroom furniture and configurable classroom space, exciti
ng classroom technology, and 
advanced campus security systems.
 
 
Recent facilities projects funded by the recent Measure V school bond include flexible classroom 
furniture, artificial turf replacement, playground refurbishment, LED lighting conversions, and
 
classroom technology purchases. Grant funded CTE program expansion will significantly update our 
existing engineering, agriculture, and medical career pathways. All LEUSD high school performing 
arts centers have recently received state
-
of
-
the
-
art sound an
d lighting upgrades, and new theater 
seating plus stage refurbishments are coming next.
 
 
A previously shuttered campus in Wildomar, Jean Hayman Elementary, was reopened this summer 
under a new development plan that will unfold over the next five years. Pha
se 1 tenant 
improvements were recently completed to accommodate the Southern California EMS Training 
Institute. Phase 2 will include refurbishment of the existing multipurpose room for professional 
development, staff training, community meeting rooms, and 
expanded parking. Phases 3 and 4 
include the relocation of existing adult education programs, new site
-
based child care, plus 
separate parking. Phase 5 will complete the relocation of our existing Adult Transition Program; 
also, installation of affordable 
housing for teachers as an incentivized recruitment strategy, 
enabling LEUSD to stay competitive in a statewide teacher shortage.
 
 
As you can see, 2020 and the beginning of a new decade has plenty for everyone to shout about!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Doug Kimberly,
 
Superintendent

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under
 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activ
ities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional i
nformation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Lake Elsinore Unified School District (LEUSD) is committed to maintaining a safe, secure, and aesthetically pleasing envi
ronment for our students. 
The LEUSD Governing Board has adopted cleaning sta
ndards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is
 
available at the school office and at the District Office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop clea
ning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. In additi
on to District
-
level support of routine and periodic maintenance needs, LEUSD holds high standards for cleanliness, appearance, 
and good repair of all campuses daily and maintains them through the efforts of the students, staff, day custodian, evening c
ust
odial crew, and District 
Maintenance Department. Our maintenance staff ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a 
timely manner.
 
 
A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service and that em
ergency repairs are given the highest priority. LEUSD regularly assesses maintenance, 
modernization, and new construction needs. Any pesticide use at our school sites is in compliance with the Healthy Schools Ac
t of 2000.
 
 
Fire drill evacuations are conduc
ted on a monthly basis at all elementary and middle schools, and twice a year at the high schools in the District. A fire 
safety inspection is conducted once each year by the Riverside County Fire Department, while site personnel conduct site insp
ections o
n a regular basis.
 
 

ementary school and middle 
school, and once each semester at the high schools.
 
 
Currently, the District provide
s storage areas for emergency supplies to be kept on campus in the event of a disaster. A radio communication system 
allows for continuous communication with the District office in the event of a disaster.
 
 
A Crisis Intervention Team has been identified an
d trained to deal with stress experienced by students and staff as a result of a crisis situation. Team 
members are called upon to assist across the District as necessary. As part of the comprehensive School Safety Program, Schoo
l Resource Officers provide
 
prevention and intervention procedures on all LEUSD campuses at least part time.
 
 
Our school was built in 2002. It has 26 regular classrooms, six science labs, eight portables, a library, a computer lab, a m
ultipurpose room, and five 
special education roo
ms. The designed capacity of the school is 1,300 students. Athletic facilities include a gym, dance room, and outside courts 
and 
fields.
 
 
A progressive discipline plan is in place and multiple discipline and Character Counts assemblies are conducted throug
hout the year. Four campus 
supervisors and a part
-
time School Resource Officer also help maintain a safe environment. The WE TIP program is utilized so that students may repor
t 
crime anonymously and all leads are followed up immediately.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety 
Plan
 
Our School Safety Plan was reviewed by our School Site Council in October 2018 and updates were presented for review to our G
overning Board . The 
School Safety Plan was last reviewed and discussed with the school faculty October 2018.
 
 
The Safe School
 
Plan (SSP) is updated annually at each site to address a 'Physical Environment' as well as a 'People and Programs' Component 
that the 
site will proactively seek to improve as it relates to student and staff safety. The SSP is available to the public for r
eview upon request.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan is fully incorporated in the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, Goal Seven, and includes data regarding the 
California Healthy Kids Survey, crime, safe school procedures, and compliance with laws in
cluding: (1) child abuse reporting, (2) disaster response and 
crisis intervention, (3) suspension and expulsion policies, (4) notification of teachers of dangerous pupils, (5) sexual hara
ssment, (6) schoolwide dress 
codes prohibiting gang
-
related apparel, 
(7) procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, (8) procedures to ensure a safe and orderly environment 
conducive to learning, and (9) rules and procedures on school discipline adopted pursuant to California Education Code Sectio
ns 35291 and 35291.
