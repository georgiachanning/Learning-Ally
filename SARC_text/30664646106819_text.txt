By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
Inspiring a capable, confident, comm
unity of tinkers.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
 
We envision a school wherein students:
 

 
Successfully apply acquired content knowledge (science, social studies) along with learning and thinking skills.
 

 
Acquire a proficient understanding of reading, writing, and speakin
g skills.
 

 
Demonstrate fundamental math knowledge that can apply to problem solving.
 

 
Engage in critical and creative thinking while collaboratively solving problems.
 

 
Are self
-
motivated, confident, considerate citizens.
 

 
Develop healthy lifestyle 
choices and an appreciation of the fine arts.
 
We will ensure a focus on standards based instruction and critical application, recognize student achievement, provide 
consistent learning that is formulated by collaborative teams, articulate clearly across gr
ade levels, be flexible and use 
varied measures, discuss student achievement regularly and openly school wide. The elements of a Professional Learning 
Community are employed to monitor our progress toward goals with developing leadership opportunities. Tea
chers 
develop and follow group norms and participate in a fair, decision
-
making process.
 
 
Truman Benedict Elementary is a beautiful campus located in the Forster Ranch section of San Clemente and a part of the 
Capistrano Unified School District. We are a t
ransitional kindergarten through fifth
-
grade school and are considered a 
high
-
performing school. Our school community is spirited and collaborative. We believe the education of a child needs to 
be balanced academically, creatively, physically, and socially
. The very best thing about Benedict School is our children. In 
the area of academics the students are challenged at all levels of learning and in all of the California State Academic 
Standards. In English/Language Arts, students work in the new district a
doption as well as utilizing Thinking Maps and 
Write From the Beginning and Beyond to apply their skills through writing. 
 
 
Our students in third, fourth and fifth grade are able to use Chromebooks and Google technology with 1:1 devices. First 
and second g
rade work on Chromebooks in small groups. All grade levels access the Innovation Station STEAM Lab to work 
on creative projects and labs in science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Technology is also linked to Science, Socia
l 
Studies, and Math with
 
our adopted curriculum and Scholastic News. We access these via SMART interactive whiteboards, 
the Internet, document cameras, and laptops. 
 
 
Mathematics is supplemented with problem solving, fact building and vocabulary development. Cognitively Guided 
In
struction (CGI) is offered in many classrooms giving students the opportunity to solve real life problems with their own 
innate problem
-
solving abilities. Student learning is differentiated when appropriate to reflect the needs of the student 
learning in e
ach class. Currently, iReady technology is being implemented to this end.

Our students receive creative opportunities in both the performing and visual arts. Fourth and fifth grade students receive 
instruction in band, strings or chorus. Primary students
 
receive music instruction emphasizing their understanding of and 
appreciation for music. Classrooms of all levels hold performances once or twice a year. We have the Art Masters program 
introducing an artist each session and providing lessons in style and
/or appreciation. Each classroom works with clay twice 
a year; we have our own kiln for firing these treasures. 
 
 
Physical fitness is encouraged at all grade levels from kindergarten students learning about the playground equipment 

third graders ha
ve recess buddies with the PAL program from the middle school (Bernice Ayer) next door. The neighboring 
middle school's PAL and Kid Next Door (KND) student groups encourage our students to become involved with sports and 
games. 
 
 
Lastly, Benedict places em
phasis on character development. TBES harnesses the collective support of our school 
community to employ PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) with fidelity, and organizes school/community 
volunteer work through Bobcat Leadership Team. A ke
y strength of our school is the positive, safe climate.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Benedict School has 30 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, a computer lab, a small RSP room, and an 
administration building. The main campus was built in 1988. One portable 
classroom was added to the seven portables 
already here, at the beginning of the 2003
-
2004 school year to accommodate growth in student population. The district 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair are comp
leted in a timely manner. 
A work order process is used to ensure services and emergency repairs are given high priority. The custodial staff has 
developed a cleaning schedule to ensure a clean school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Benedict 
Elementary School enjoys a high level of parent involvement. Parents can come to the school informally and help 
out in the classroom with small groups of children, individual tutoring, clerical work, field trips, reading aloud or even 
something demonstrati

Parent Teachers Association (PTA). Our PTA is very strong and involved. They have Room Mom leaders who guide 
classroom volunteers or they participate throug
h the Executive Board of PTA and work on committees for parent 
education, school support (such as the copy room, library, and computer lab), student/family entertainment, fundraising 
and basically the betterment of the school for our children. We have the 
"Watchdog Dads" Program at school. We also 
have the Forster Ranch Education Foundation which allows the teachers and principals to handle fiscal transactions, 
fundraise and support programs through grants.This allows for dads and other male volunteers, aft
er screening, visit our 
campus, assist with school activties, have lunch with their students and more.   FREF consists of parents and volunteers 
from both Benedict and Bernice Ayer Middle School.  There are many venues for volunteering here at Benedict Sch

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes 
systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It i
s 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great 
First Instruction (GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for pro
viding professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that l
earning to the 

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Stan
dards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collabora
tion for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon
 
which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to
 
high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 
Communities Framework as
 

Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students a
re learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their
 
first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is 
approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities
 
to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
