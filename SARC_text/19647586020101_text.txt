Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Rancho Santa Gertrudes
 
Elementary School, where we continue to make great 
progress in building and enriching student learning through the teacher, parent, and community 
commitment to our children. We are a K
-
6 elementary school and are committed to meeting the 
specific needs of
 
all students. Our program offers a full
-
day kindergarten with a student
-
teacher 
ratio of 24 to 1. Also, our K 
-
 
3 class size average is 24 to 1. Breakfast and lunch is provided free of 
charge for all students. Our school has a part
-
time library clerk and 
a school library stocked with a 
wide variety of books. We take great pride in offering an excellent after school program, Boys & 
Girls Club, and several school clubs that include: the Rancho Kindness Krew, Science Olympiad Club, 
and Chess Club. At Rancho, 
the stakeholders are important pieces of the puzzle in building the 
pyramid of success for our students and our school. Parents, teachers, students, support staff, and 
community all play a significant role to ensure that students perform to their potential
, both 
academically and personally.
 
 
Currently, with an enrollment of approximately 358 students, Rancho prospers because of the 
efforts of our entire school community. We count on our talented, committed staff that are all 
highly qualified and work togeth
er to meet and exceed the high standards of the California 
Distinguished School title that we were awarded in 2004. Additionally, active supportive parents 
and neighborhood businesses are eager to support our school as part of our team. We have been 
proact
ive in meeting the needs of all students by implementing a Response to Instruction and 
Intervention model in language arts and math. To ensure that our English Learner population is 
achieving, we provide English Learners with a standards
-
based program to t
each the English 
Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) standards along with the California 
Common Core State Standards for Language Arts and Mathematics. All of our students benefit from 
curriculum programs that are aligned with the Calif
ornia Common Core State Standards.
 
 
Our vision is to build our community through education to ensure students are prepared 
academically and socially for future success.
 
 
Our mission is to:
 

 
Provide a variety of learning strategies to meet or exceed the New 
California Common 
Core academic standards.
 

 
Encourage critical thinking in all curricular areas.
 

 
Value collaborative/reflective teaching and learning.
 

 
Appreciate and respect the home culture of students.
 

 
Maintain rules and procedures to ensure the physical 
safety of every child.

children has enabled Rancho to participate in many literacy, art, and safety programs. The city continues to work with us in 
providing a task force to assist with safety issues, opportunities for teachers to earn grants for art programs, outstanding 
literacy programs bringing authors to the school, and reading programs. Rancho has won first place in the Santa Fe Springs 

s Battle of the Books competition in 2017, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the 
SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Textbooks
 
We choo
se our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials. For a list of some of the textbooks
 
we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report. We have also reported additional facts about our textbook
s called for by the Williams legislation of 
2004. This online report shows whether we had a textbook for each student in each core course during the 2016

2017 school year and whether those 
textbooks covered the New California Content Standards.
 
 
Curriculum
 
For more than several years, panels of scholars have decided what California students should learn and be able to do. Their d
ecisions are known as the 
California Content Standards, and they apply to all public schools in the state. The textbooks we use an
d the tests we give are based on these content 
standards, and we expect our teachers to be firmly focused on them. Policy experts, researchers, and educators consider our s

among the most rigorous and challenging in the nation.You can
 
find information about the California State Standards for each subject at each grade level 
on the Web site of the California Department of Education (CDE). Please refer to the CDE FAQs for details about the new Calif
ornia standards.
 
 
Computers
 
Computer sk
ills and concepts at Rancho Santa Gertrudes School are integrated into the standard curriculum and aligned to the District Te
chnology Use 
Plan, which prepares students for technological growth and opportunities. K
-
1 classrooms contain one iPad cart each fo
r 1:1 device ratio to provide 
instructional assistance in language arts, math, social studies, and science. All 2nd 
-
 
6th grade classrooms have Chromebooks for each of their students 
representing a 1:1 device ratio. We also have a computer labs with 36 com
puters. Students are exposed to many different applications and computer 
resources, and they can work on a variety of projects on the computer related to what is being taught in the classroom. Also,
 
there is a 65 inch monitor 
with an Apple TV device connec
ted to the internet in every classroom. Software includes programs to develop critical thinking, digital media, 
mathematical problem
-
solving, word processing, and presentation skills. We have Wi
-
Fi access all over campus. All teachers have access to email 
and the 
Internet. They use computers to keep attendance, record grades, prepare report cards, and correspond via email with parents a
nd colleagues.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, functional and well
-
maintained for all our students, staff, and community 
members. All of our classrooms are 
air
-
conditioned. The restrooms are cleaned and stocked daily. We have a day and a night custodian who work closely 
with our district's maintenance staff to keep the campuses clean from litter and graffiti, as well as regularly check the pla
yground equipmen
t for safety 
hazards. Landscaping upkeep is maintained by the district maintenance team at all sites. During the summer of 2011, the schoo

renovated. The school received a new security fence around the entire campus perimeter, includ
ing two new security gates at the entrance of the 
campus. To further increase school safety, the entryway of the school was redesigned and renovated, allowing for only one way
 
in and one way off 
campus. In summer of 2014, the school fire and security syste
m was updated. These improvements were made possible due to the passing of the Measure 
M Bond. During the summer of 2017, all classroom light fixtures were change to LD lights. In the summer of 2018, a staff park
ing lot was built allowing 
the front parking
 
lot to be remodeled to allow parents drop and pick up their students right in front of the school. Rancho will receive furthe
r renovations 
from bond funds beginning the summer of 2020.

More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available 
in an online supplement to this report called for by the Williams Legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and m
ore. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If an
ything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guideli
nes for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Los Nietos School District.  Staff members monitor the school gr
ounds before and after school, 
as well as during recess and lunchti
me. Our campus is closed and visitors must enter the school through the main office and sign in. Once on campus, 

ucation for all st
udents and 
our discipline policy seeks to assure a safe and orderly environment for students and staff.
 
 
All schools in the district are in compliance with all laws, and regulations pertaining to emergency and disaster preparednes
s. All buildings within the 
district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. The district safety consultant inspects the
 
school campus twice a year to look for safety 

re corrected immediately. 
The district safety committee meets multiple times a year 
to discuss safety issues, training, and other ways to help mitigate safety concerns. Rancho's 
comprehensive school safety plan is annually updated by March 1st of each school year. The school plans include disaster proc
edures, policies, discipline 
plan, an
d other safety information. The school plan is shared with the staff and we practice fire, earthquake, and lock down drills r
egularly. We have 
earthquake storage bins that include food, water, and emergency supplies. These bins are inspected annually and t
heir contents are replaced as needed.

District and site leadership provide training and teacher support that is aligned to the state and the federal requirements. 
We review the content 
standards and regularly 
identify critical benchmarks that allow each student to meet or exceed grade level targets. The focus for the Los Nietos Scho
ol 
District has been to develop a comprehensive literacy and math program that provides skilled instruction for all students and
 
to
 
group students according 
to their level. We provide advanced instruction for students who are at or above level and intensive support for students who
 
need additional assistance.
 
 
District and site professional development days on early
-
release Tuesdays e
nsure consistent student support by grade level. We emphasize the 
development of initial literacy skills through the acquisition of complex reading comprehension and critical writing skills. 
Math is also aligned to the 
content standards, and we are emphasi
zing successful acquisition of early pre
-
algebra skills to prepare students for the higher levels of math in middle 
school.
