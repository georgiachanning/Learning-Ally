About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul
d contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Junction Elementary School 
District believes that in order to achieve this educational belief, we must equip our students with textbooks, instructional 
materials and appropriate instruction. The Junction Elementary School District follows the California schedule for textbook a
nd sta
ndards adoption.
 
 
When it comes time to adopt a new textbook series, the district creates a committee made up of teachers, aides, administratio
n and parents to review 
all California state
-
adopted series; they then make their recommendation to the Board of 
Education.
 
 
The district has also adopted the policy that all core instructional materials must be state
-
adopted and district
-
approved. The district also reviews current 
instructional materials on an ongoing basis to make sure they are still appropriate fo
r the district goals and beliefs. The district has affirmed that every 
student has access to their own textbooks and instructional materials for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
All Junction Elementary School students receive weekly 
classroom music instruction. They also receive art instruction and theater experiences in the 
regular classroom setting.

The Junction 
Elementary School District understands that with the quickly changing expectations from both the state and federal government
 
regarding 
education, professional development is imperative to continue giving our students the best quality education possible. T
he district is committed both in 
policy and budget to provide opportunities for professional development.
 
 
We have three days each year dedicated to staff and professional development. The district also uses a minimum day on the fir
st Monday of each month,
 
as well as participates in the county co
-
op to train staff members.  Our teachers attend workshops and conferences presented by the district, county and 
other professional organizations.  New teachers and site mentors participate in the Alliance for Teach
er Excellence offered through Tehama County 
Department of Education.
 
 
New teachers participate in a two
-
year observation and evaluation process where they work with the site administration and mentors.  The school staff 
(classified, certificated and admini
stration) regularly review student performance data.  This data is also regularly reviewed by the Junction School Site 
Council and School Board.
