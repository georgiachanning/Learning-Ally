By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school pe
rsonnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are a variety of 
opportunities for parents to be involved at Kensington School. Parent volunteers are welcomed in 
our classrooms; during enrichment programs including art, PE, science lab, and computer lab; and at our annual Art Night, 
Family Math Night, Multicultural Nigh
t, and Book Fair. We rely on parent volunteers to supervise the playgrounds during 
lunch recess and to volunteer as drivers and chaperones on field trips.
 
 
There are three parent organizations on our campus: PTA, KEF, and Dads' Club.
 
 
The PTA invites speak
ers of general interest to bi
-
monthly meetings, sponsors the annual spring carnival, and provides a 
regular forum for parents to hear from the school principal, educators, and other interested parents, as well as to advocate 
for the interests of students a
nd families on the local, state, and national level.
 
 
Kensington Education Foundation (KEF) raises money for enrichment and intervention programs that serve all students.
 
 

uch as the school carnival and the 
annual movie night in conjunction with the PTA.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) gives parents, faculty, and staff more on
-
site decision making ability by giving individuals the 
opportunity to work together to plan school p
rogram improvements. Every elementary school must have a School Site 
Council composed of five parents or community members, the principal, three classroom teachers, and one other staff 
member (Education Code Section 52852).

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

The purpose of the 
School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.

The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff r
esponse to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may
 
occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
properties.
 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and 
coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, wh
en necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School
