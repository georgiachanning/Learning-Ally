By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

to the supplemental iPad resource we are also introducing Virtual Reality devices 
to bring the world to Grace Smith School. 
We continue to focus our push for academic success and support our academic needs with intervention programs such 
as, English in a Flash and Read Naturally. Our school continues to support core standards and achiev
ement for all students. 
Our ASES Program provides an expanded offering of services and continues to exceed daily attendance goals. Parents and 
community members are an important part of our academic program. We welcome your participation in our school 
acti
vities and encourage you to become active partners in your students education through involvement with the English

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have enough books in core 
classes for al
l students. The law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California content 
standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when viewed along with the more detailed description of 
textbooks contained in our
 

in our core classes, their dates of publication, the names of the firms that published them, and more.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

and state regulations and student achievement. I
n addition to site led activities, Grace Smith School actively participates 
in parent involvement activities provided and coordinated through the Calipatria USD Projects Office.  We also have a 
partnership with a parent organization, the Calipatria Family 
Resource Center, and the Grace Smith Community Club. This 
club provides fun activities for our students during special occasions. All parents are encouraged to participate in these 
organizations or volunteer to help in classrooms. For more information abou
t becoming involved, please contact the site

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our 
school facilities and grounds are maintained on a regular basis. To address school safety, staff members monitor our 
campus before school, after school, and during recess. We have playground equipment in line with current safety 
standards. We inspect playg
round equipment regularly and routinely review playground safety rules with students. We 
also practice fire and earthquake drills throughout the year. We review and update our safety plan annually. In addition, 
the faculty has weekly opportunities to ident
ify potential safety problems during our weekly staff meetings.
