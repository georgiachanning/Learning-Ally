By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Emma Wilson Elementary opened in 1993. It is Chico Unified 
School District's newest elementary school. The beautiful 
campus is located on the suburban west side of Chico, surrounded by quiet neighborhoods, orchards and an adjacent city 
park. Emma Wilson is within walking distance of the California State University
, Chico, which provides additional 
opportunities and educational resources for our students. The architectural design of the campus fosters cohesiveness 
among staff and students. The school is arranged in u
-
shaped, pod
-
like clusters. This allows grade leve
ls easy access to 
one another. Two of our clusters share small common rooms located between each classroom. These rooms are used for 
providing interventions and small group instruction, and in some cases for small computer labs. Having classrooms joined 
to
gether allow for collaboration and interaction among grade levels and provide opportunities for older and younger 
children to work together. Four additional small size rooms house our Primary Intervention Program (PIP), school 
counseling services and are u
sed to provide small group interventions. Our Learning Center and Communicably 
Handicapped program (CH) share an over
-
sized classroom in the front of the school and operate as a learning center. Two 
small rooms are attached which allow for small group inst
ruction. We have two special day classes that occupy two full 
size classrooms. Our Title I and English Language Development (ELD) programs occupy small intervention rooms. Music 
and Fine Arts programs are provided and take place in individual classrooms an
d on the stage in the multipurpose room. 
A new building will open in 2020
-
2021 that will house two kindergarten classrooms and one transitional kindergarten 
classroom. New playground equipment and an outdoor learning area will be adjacent to the new buildi
ng.
 
 
The staff of Emma Wilson works hard to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe and functional learning 
environment. Located in the heart of the school is a courtyard where school events, such as the 5th grade promotion 
assembly, take plac
e. Our large staff room overlooks the courtyard and is part of the main office building. Our library is 
neatly organized and offers an abundance of reading resources meeting the interest of any student. The library also houses 
our computer lab, consisting 
of forty computers interconnected with the school network server. Both the library and 
computer labs are well used by students and staff, and are maintained and updated with the newest publications and 
technology including school
-
wide wireless access. Emma
 
Wilson is approaching one computer device per student 
(Chromebooks, iPads, iPad minis, desktops).
 
 
Our Mission at Emma Wilson Elementary School is to assure high levels of learning for all students: "Everyone Working for 
Excellence" 
 
 
Our Vision at Emma W
ilson is guided by the following essential questions:
 
 
1) 
What do we expect students to learn?
 
 
2)How do we know when they have learned it?
 
 
3) How will we respond when students don't learn?
 
 
4)What enrichment opportunities will we provide 
students?
 
 
5) How will we provide students the opportunity to connect to our community?

Updated and readily available resources are important if students are 
to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adop
tions.  All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comprised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education.The CUSD convenes curricular task fo
rces to 
review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the 
adoption cycle. These standards aligned textbooks are in the hands of all students within two years of adoption.

The school has three large playground areas designated for kindergarten, primary and intermediate. The school has posted 
requirements that all visitors check in at the office and receive a visit
or's badge or sticker. The school provides before
-
school and after
-
school supervision for students being dropped off or picked up. District maintenance staff and site 
custodial staff ensure that the school is in good repair and working order. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient 
service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The principal works closely with the custodial staff to 
ensure that all school facilities are kept clean and free of safety hazards. The district partici
pates in the State School 
Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist the school 
district with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, thi
s includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alt
ernate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our School Site 
Council, made up of parents and staff members, provides leadership through the development of our 
school plan, Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) and other school activities. The families are given the opportunity to 
participate in a school climate s
urvey every year to determine what parents think of the school's effectiveness. The Parent 
Teacher Student Association (PTSA) is a strong, active organization which sponsors the Fall Festival, various fundraisers, 
Book Fair and many other educational activ
ities for students and families.
 
 
We have a variety of daytime and evening activities for our families. Some of these activities include: Technology Night, 
Math Night, Open House, Back to School Night, Title 1 parent meetings, English Learner Advisory Co
mmittee meetings 
and a number of student performances and curricular presentations.
 
 
Our teachers and administrator have an "open door policy" which invites parents to our school for thoughtful and essential 
dialogue. Discussions can range from 
student concerns and joys, to policies and procedures, and questions and input.
 
 
All parental involvement opportunities and contacts can be found on the school website at:

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Safe Schools Plan includes emergency procedures in case of fire, earthquake, or other disaster. The Safe 
Schools Plan 
is updated annually in accordance with Senate Bill 187. The key elements of the Safe School Plan are: traumatic incidents, 
imminent danger procedure (code red), evacuation/relocation procedure, civil defense/disorder, bomb threat/bomb 
emergenc
y, earthquake, chemical spill, crime in progress, and fire/explosion. The staff and students have received special 
training on procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. A copy of these procedures is available on our school 
website, in the office a
nd in every classroom for viewing. In an effort to ensure student safety while traveling to and from 
school, a crossing guard is located at the stop sign on the corner of West Sacramento Avenue and West Eighth Avenue. A 
traffic light is in place at Nord Av
enue and West Eighth Avenue. A stop sign is in place at the corner of West Eighth Avenue 
and Forty Niner Court. Parents have signed a "Traffic Calming Plan" promoting student safety, courtesy and efficiency of 
traffic flow. The district has installed fenci
ng around the entire campus. Visitors must check in with the front office to allow 
entry to campus. Additionally, 15 cameras have been installed to maintain security. We are focusing on the premise that 
"We value a physically and emotionally safe and secur
e school environment," which is a high priority at Emma Wilson.
