Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority:
 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarte
r Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The per
centage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem

scores.

Additionally, we average over 500 parents and students par
ticipating in our annual My Plate Color Run.  Parents are 
welcome at any time to visit their child's classroom. We welcome parent input and are advised on various school issues 
through our School Site Council which holds meetings at least 4 times a year on
 
Tuesday or Thursday evenings. In addition, 
our school also has an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) parent group that meets once a quarter.  Lastly, in 
partnership with our feeder school we host informational parent seminars to cover topics such a
s Bullying, Digital 
citizenship and other topics on an as needed basis.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
We continue to focus on fundamental instructional practices such as guided reading and math instruction. In addition we 
are concentrating our efforts on reading instruction as well as both designated and integrated English Language 
Development strategies. 
Student achievement scores on the CAASPP led us to modify some ELA and Math instruction to 
better serve the needs of our students. Our ELPAC results also led us to spend time concentrating on ELD to initiate 
stronger support for our English learners. This 
year we have spent time breaking down our core subject instruction by 
reexamining certain teaching practices and planning units to align schoolwide. Our professional development has focused 
on each of the core subjects such as ELA, Math, Science and Histor
y planning and instruction. We have also spent time 
learning about more effective ELD instruction. Professional development is delivered in a variety of ways that include, 
summer training days, conference and seminar attendance, mentoring, in class coachin
g, and  late start Wednesday 
morning meetings. The professional learning for the 2019
-
20 school year includes Professional Learning Communities, 
Guided Reading, Rigorous Curriculum Design, Literacy Training, Writing Units of Study, ELD standards, number ta
lks, and 
implementation of Common Core State Standards. Teacher support is provided by Principal, Learning Director, Academic 
Coach and TCOE consultants as well as district administration.
