School Description
 
 
Mission: To educate students with special needs in the least restrictive learning environment to 
enable them to pursue productive and independent lives.
 
 
Special Day Class (SDC) Program: The East County 
Student Programs (ECSP) provides a full range of 
services designed to meet the needs of students with severe disabilities from pre
-
Kindergarten to 
age 22. Programs emphasize the integration of students with age
-
appropriate peers, placement in 
the least res
trictive environment, a comprehensive curriculum for severely handicapped, and 

instructional programs as well as having facilities that are appropriate and
 
maintained in a safe 
condition. This special education curriculum for students with severe disabilities is based on the 
core areas identified in the Common Core State Standards.
 
 
As part of ECSP, the Intensive program serves students in grades K
-
5 in seve
ral special day classes 
throughout the county. The program assists students with autism, autistic
-
like behaviors and 
intensive behaviors to manage academic, social and functional demands through a variety of 
approaches within a gated, structured environmen
t. As appropriate, staff provides opportunities 
for integration with age
-
appropriate peers, community outings to practice social skills and 
modifications for academic programming.
 
 
The Early Start program is part of the Contra Costa County Office of Educat
ion that serves infants 
and toddlers from 0 to three years of age through a home
-
based and a classroom program.  
Children, age birth to three who have vision, hearing, orthopedic problems or other developmental 
disabilities are the targeted population.  Th
e team, consisting of a teacher, instructional assistant, 
speech and/or occupational therapist, and/or specialists in vision and hearing assist the family by

About the SARC
 
By February 1 o
f each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The S
ARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Form
ula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and loca
l priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, pa
rents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

School Facility Conditions a
nd Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The East County Special Education Program consist of classes in three schools
-
 
Turner Elementary, Diablo Vista Elementary and Krey Elementary. The 
Turner school was built in 1972 and remodeled in 2011. There are f
ive classrooms at the Turner site with portables, auditorium, kitchen, and playground. 
There are 3 additional classrooms located off
-
site at Krey Elementary in Brentwood and Diablo Vista in Antioch. There are separate FIT Reports for each 
site.
 
 
All studen
ts are under direct staff supervision while in transit to and from school with assistance from transportation personnel. Whil
e on school sites, 
students are under direct supervision from both classified and certificated personnel. Students may be early rel
eased only to authorized adults who are 
required to identify themselves and sign out the student in the main office.
 
 
Access to school sites is restricted, requiring all visitors to check in at the main office for clearance and registration. A
ll facilities
 
and grounds are observed 
and monitored for unauthorized visitors who are reported to the main office for appropriate action. When visitors are approve
d to be on campus they 
are given a temporary badge identifying them as a guest. Volunteers are required t
o be interviewed and approved by site administration and to register 
with the central office Human Resources Department and receive TB clearance. All regular personnel are provided with picture 
I.D. badges for their use.
 
 
All sites are regularly cleaned an
d maintained by custodial staff.
 
 
Facilities maintenance is ongoing and coordinated with site principals through the central office facilities department. More
 
intensive cleaning and 
maintenance occurs during student break/vacation periods in order to mini
mize impact to learning environment.  Emergency repairs are typically handled 
in a timely manner.
 
 
Adequate and appropriate classroom and playground space is available. Playground areas have been upgraded to current safety c
odes. Specialized 
equipment is a
ccessible for use by students with special needs. Workspace and break/lounge areas for staff have been designated.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2018
-
19)
 
Through informational flyers, parents are made aware of fundrai
sers and numerous support groups. Parents are encouraged to participate in classroom 
activities and field trips
 
 
Parent Resource Night is an event that provides parents with connections to community resources that may interest their child
. It is held annua
lly and 
includes various vendors from the Regional Center, local sports teams, law enforcement and extra curricular activities.
 
 
Parents are involved in the education of their students through the Individual Education Program (IEP) process. As an IEP tea
m 
member, each parent 
participates in the development of annual academic, behavioral, and social goals for his/her child.
 
 
In order to obtain valuable feedback and suggestions for improvement, parents of infants and toddlers in our Early Start prog
ram are su
rveyed annually. 
Information from the surveys is analyzed and used when developing future goals.  The overall results of recent parent surveys
 
show a ninety percent 
satisfaction rate with our Early Start program.

During implementation of instruction, teachers are supported through in
-
class coaching, teacher collaboration, teacher
-
principal meetings and 
encouragement of thematic lesson plans.
 
 
The CCCOE offers support to teachers through a variety of programs, as determined by need. The CCCOE Teacher Induction Progra
m (TIP) provides a 
collaborative model of support providing a pathway for teachers to clear their credential. Intern teachers parti
cipate in the Solano/North Bay/Contra 
Costa Teacher Intern Program, and are generally referred to TIP once they receive their preliminary credential. Another relat
ively new teacher support 
program was created for those teachers who may be new to their assi
gnment. This program is called the New Assignment Mentor Support (NAMS) 
program and both veteran and new teachers may be eligible. Finally, struggling teachers may be referred to the Peer Assistanc
e Review (PAR) program 
as a result of an unsatisfactory eva
luation. Also, a website has been developed to help all teachers access quality instructional lessons and links to existing 
exemplary programs. Methods of professional development may include after school workshops individual conferences, peer coach
ing, cl
assroom 
visitations, veteran teacher observation and attendance at professional development conferences and meetings.
