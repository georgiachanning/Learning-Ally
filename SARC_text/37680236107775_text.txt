C
hula Vista Hills is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including five 
dependent and three independent charter schools. Chula Vista Hills was dedicated on February 16, 
1989. The school lies west of Southwestern College on a 10

creatively.
 
 
At Chula Vista Hills, we SPRINT to success by teaching and exemplifying our core values in all we 
do.  We are Safe, Positive, Respectful, Innovative, Nurturing, Thinkers!
 
 
School Focus
 
At CV Hills we are focused on using the
 
workshop model to instill a love of reading and writing in 
our students.  Teachers regularly use thinking routines to engage students in critical thinking and 
collaborative conversations.  This year, our instructional focus has been:  Collaborative 
conver
sations to deepen learning.  We are focused on creating opportunities for our students to 
engage in content
-
rich conversations and discussions to enhance their learning and growth.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by s
tate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are req
uired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mor
e information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should 
contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety 
Plan
 
Chula Vista Hills provides students and staff with a safe, orderly learning environment. High behavioral expectations are cle
arly stated and understood 
by students, staff members, and parents through our Cheetah SPRINT core values:  Safe, Positive, Re
spectful, Innovative, Nurturing, Thinkers. These 
values are explicitly taught and modeled to our students.  CV Hills has established a PBIS committee to ensure that we are pr
oactive in our approach to 
student behavior.  We are also committed to meeting the
 
social emotional needs of our students and ensuring that our students are safe and supported.
