curriculum within a caring environment. Imperial staff strives to help children realize their full 
potential, develop a positive self

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more inf
ormation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the scho
ol principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Clas
srooms, bathrooms, and general areas are in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Detailed cleaning is done during vacation periods. The district provides maintenance
 
services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety co
ncerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct 
inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The District administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable lea
rning environment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working order. Daily reports of incidents that require repair at t
he school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest prio
rity. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assi
st 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this inc
ludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. The Di

To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

 
ensuring student and staff 
safety during a 
disaster. Monthly fire drills and disaster drop drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. A storage
 
bin contains 
food, water, and other supplies for use during a disaster.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus. All visitors are required 
to sign
-

other campus supervisors monitor activity and ensure student safety.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed annually, was developed by the s
chool staff to provide students and staff a means to ensure a 
safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include: child abuse reporting proc
edures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaster
 
response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment 
policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and discipline policies. The school safety committee and district pers
onnel evaluate the plan 
annually and
 
update the plan as needed. The School Safety Plan was last revised in October.
