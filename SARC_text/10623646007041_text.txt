School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Vision and Mission
 
 
John C. Martínez Elementary School seeks to develop the whole child academically, socially, and emotionally, helping 
prepare him/her to succee
d in the world.  We recognize that students bring a rich diversity of cultures, experiences, 
languages and learning styles that can be developed and shared in our school setting.  Students should feel connected to 
the school and its objectives, value what 
they learn, and trust those who are teaching.
 
 
Teachers/Students will model valuable life skills such as cooperation, conflict resolution, critical thinking, effective 
communication, problem solving, responsibility and accountability.  Students will develo
p self
-
esteem and feel free to 
question and explore a larger world.  They will discover and strengthen their talents, learn and practice social and 
leadership skills, and successfully meet both high academic and behavior expectations.
 
 
School Profile
 
 
Mart
ínez Elementary School is a TK
-
6 school serving the community of Parlier, California, nestled in the heart of the great 
San Joaquin Valley in Fresno County, the largest agricultural county in the United States.
 
 
The city of Parlier is a small, rural 
community of approximately 12,500 residents and was incorporated in 1921.  It is a 
place rich with cultural heritage and ablaze with lively memories of Latino
-
rights icons like César E. Chávez and Dolores 
Huerta. The per capita income in Parlier is the thi
rd lowest in California, and the town ranks number one in the state in 
the number of families living below the poverty level. Unemployment figures for Parlier are continually among the highest 
in the state. The city, however, is beginning to grow and there
 
are new homes under construction in the Martinez area. 
The City of Parlier has a Latino Chief of Police and Latino Mayor and City Council. The town feels a special respect for its 
roots and celebrates its primary culture and language as it embraces its ne
w cultures and languages as well.
 
 
The Parlier Migrant Housing Project houses migrant farm worker families who traditionally arrive in April and remain until 
October, harvesting the fruit and vegetables of Fresno County. Most of these students are from 
Mexico and the southern 
tip of Texas.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
