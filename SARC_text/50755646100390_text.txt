School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Magnolia is a traditional elementary school with TK
-
6th
-
grade students. Magnolia's mission statement is "Magnolia...a 
place where students and learning come first". The acronym P.R.I.D.E. continues to be used to show that we always are 
"Putting 
Respect into Daily Efforts". Our staff and students fully embody our mission statement and the P.R.I.D.E acronym. 
Students and staff repeat our mission daily, are taught and reminded to take pride in themselves and their school and are 
expected to show tha
t pride by always giving their best efforts, respecting themselves and others, and taking care of 
personal and school property. School staff members believe in the Oakdale Joint Unified School District's mission of 
"Teach, Learn, Every Day, No Excuses!" an
d work hard to provide students with the tools they need to achieve success 
with Common Core State Standards and to ultimately become "College and Career Ready" Seniors.
 
 
Magnolia has a variety of programs to support student achievement. Qualified 3rd
-
6th
-
grade students are able to receive 
enrichment through our Gifted and Talented Education program as well as differentiation in the classroom. To support 
struggling students teachers provide Tier 1 support in the classrooms through small group instruction. I
n addition, we have 
a Title 1 funded MTSS Learning Lab for students needing additional support in reading and math. Students needing deeper 
support may qualify for our Resource or Special Day Special Education Classes. Magnolia also has an after school pro
gram 
which provides students with a safe environment after school and assistance with their homework.  Students are also able 
to contribute to the campus by participating in our Garden Club, Kindness Crew, and Student Council.
 
 
Through data analysis, the s
taff collaboratively determined our site goals for the current year. We are striving for an 
increase in student achievement in English Language Arts and Math. In addition, there is a focused goal for our High 
Priority students to improve their achievement 
in English Language Arts and Math. To improve our school culture, a goal 
has been developed to decrease our discipline incidents and increase student attendance. Finally, to support the Oakdale 
Joint Unified School District vision of College and Career Rea
dy Seniors, our site goal is for our 3rd
-
6th
-
grade students to 
have identified a career of interest.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Our Comprehensive School Safety Plan is reviewed and updated annually, with the most recent review completed October 
14, 2019. Staff and parent advisory committees provide input to the plan which covers procedures for emergencies, the 
location of exit rout
es, and staff responsibilities during times of need. The school practices monthly fire drills and quarterly 
earthquake and lockdown drills. Our school Safety Committee meets regularly to review the campus and identify any 
safety needs. Each year 2
-
3 safety
 
goals are developed and provide a focus for site improvements. School safety is regularly 
reviewed during monthly staff meetings.

Magnolia has a variety of funded programs to support students and their educational growth. Federal Title 1 funds for 
low

and math standards. Title 1 Aides work with small groups of students to support the instructional program in our MTSS 
Learning Lab and also provide Recess Tutorial during student recesses. Much of Magnolia's technology and educational 
t
ech programming is funded with Title 1 funds.  An After School Education and Safety (ASES) grant helps fund student 
remediation for our students that are below grade level, according to District benchmarks and/or standardized test scores. 
Funds raised by o
ur Parent Teacher Club through their various fund raisers help to purchase new library books, playground 
equipment, technology, field trips and other enrichment opportunities for our students.
