By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP
, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princip
al or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The staff of Holder strives to maintain a clean 

aesthetic and safety conditions are made by the principal on a monthly basis, and thorough quarterly inspections are made 

 
Transportation. Custodians make routine, daily inspections of 
all exterior and interior areas of the school. As per SB550 all facilities are in good repair.  Modernization projects were 
completed for the Holder campus during 2013
-
14 as a result of the pas
sage of Measure G at the June 5, 2012 election.  A 


-
appropriate equipment 
designed to promote physical 
fitness, large and small motor skills, balance, and upper
-
body strength for students.  The poured
-
in
-
place rubber surfacing 
was designed to provide high levels of safety for students with minimal maintenance requirements. In ad
dition, classrooms 
and office spaces were enhanced with new furniture, upgraded wall systems, energy efficient dual
-
paned windows, new 
energy efficient heating and air conditioning units, new plumbing, electrical, and upgraded roofing. Our heating and air 
conditioning units, lighting, security cameras, classroom projectors, and even irrigation systems are on energy 
management systems, controlled remotely to ensure that units do not run during times they are not needed. Preschool 
and before
-
and
-
after
-
school 
childcare programs were relocated to provide better access for parents during hours when 
the school office is not open. School security enhancements are multi
-
faceted and include perimeter fencing, security 
cameras throughout the campus, paging systems, em
ergency notification systems, enhanced fire alarm systems, and 

and sewer lines, energy
-
efficient fixtures, and terrazzo flooring that 
will last at least another 50 years! Regular 

Technology Learning Center with 30 computers, a teaching station and flat screen monitors w
as completed.  In the 
summer of 2016, a second Technology Learning Center with an additional 32 computers with flat screen monitors was 
added, and in the summer of 2019 a third Technology Learning Center was added.  A STEM Center with additional 
computers 
with flat screen monitors was added in 2017.  In addition, there are six computers in every classroom and 
various classrooms throughout the site utilize iPads as part of the instructional program.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.
