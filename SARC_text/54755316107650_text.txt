A Message from the Principal:
 
Roosevelt Elementary School has 654 students in
 
 
transitional kindergarten 
through grade six.  We 
have one full
-
time academic program improvement (API) coach and one Learning Director.
 
 
Our teachers and staff are dedicated to ensuring the academic success of every student and 
providing a safe and productive learning experience.
 
The school holds high expectations for the 
academic and social development of all students. Curriculum planning, staff development, and 
assessment activities are focused on assisting students in mastering the state academic content 
standards, as well as i
ncreasing the overall student achievement of all subgroups.
 
 
In addition, we 
teach students to be students of character.
 
 
We believe that excellence in academics and respectful 
attitudes and behaviors are the key to success now and for the future.
 
 
We beli
eve that there is no 
limit to what our students can become or achieve.
 
 
Parents and community members are important to our academic program. We welcome your 
participation in school activities and encourage you to join our PTO,
 
 
Parenting Partners, School
 
Site 
Council (SSC), and English Language Learner Advisory Council (ELAC). Our staff looks forward to 
working with you and our students on another year of academic success.
 
 
Focus for Improvement:
 
Teachers monitor student progress through data 
analysis results from SBAC results, EL 
Assessments, district benchmarks, Achieve 3000, and STAR reading during weekly collaboration 
times.
 
 
Students are taught Common Core using the design of Launch, Explore, Summarize.  Teachers are 
conscious of time on
 
task, alignment of standards, breadth of standards, and instructional 
effectiveness.  Students are taught grade level standards every day.
 
 
To address the urgent needs of our English Language Learners, Roosevelt implements the District 
adopted Journeys 
ELD embedded curriculum, Achieve 3000, and best practices English Language 
Development. This specific instruction is designed to accelerate the language skills of our EL 
students.
 
 
We use Systematic Instruction in Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, and Sight W
ords, Achieve 3000, 
and Learning A to Z for students reading below grade level. In addition, a credentialed teacher and 
instructional assistants are now trained in the Orton Gillingham approach to implement an 
additional layer of instructional support for 
students who are below basic in reading.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning field trips
. Parents may also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, 
including, but not limited to, the English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), and School S
ite Council (SSC), and our 
Parenting Partners Group. Addition
al opportunities for parental involvement also exist at the district level.

We screen volunteers through our district office. Once they have been cleared, they must sign in and out in the office. Our s
outh gates that run parallel 
to t
he main parking lot now remain locked during the school day, facilitating a safer morning drop off and afternoon pick up proc
edure for our 
students.
 
 
We have a new front office door that opens into the office.
 
 
The addition of the additional locking gates 
require that all individuals check in at 
the front office prior to proceeding onto campus.
 
 
No one is allowed to bypass the front office when entering campus.
 
 
After the school day begins, this 
is the only access to get onto the campus. All other gates/doo
rs are locked.
