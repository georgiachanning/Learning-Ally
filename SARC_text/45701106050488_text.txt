School 
Description
 
This is Mrs. Reaves' second year as principal at Juniper School. Prior to becoming principal, Mrs. 
Reaves worked in middle school general education in the Redding School District for 21 years.
 
 
Everyone involved in supporting Juniper students b
elieves that the academic potential of each 
student is tremendous and that all students can learn in a caring, loving, and safe environment. We 
make No Excuses for the difficult challenges that many of our students face each day.  We have 
support systems i
n place to help our students learn competencies in academic content and social 
emotional literacy.  We know that one of the greatest predictors of advancement, prosperity, and 
happiness is educational success. Therefore, we are committed to creating a scho
ol that knows no 
limits to the success of each student.
 
 
Our Mission:  Juniper students will persist in becoming successful students as we teach our students 
the skills needed to succeed in school and beyond.  Students will demonstrate kindness and 
compass
ion and empathy for others as they contribute to their community.  We accomplish this 
through relationship building, high expectations, support structures, and meaningful experiences. 
We develop excellence for all by connecting to the WHOLE person.
 
 
Our Vi
sion: We are BOLD:  Brave, Optimistic, Loyal, and Determined.
 
 
Teachers, staff, and the administration work together to make decisions using a collaborative 
model and collected student and family input. We believe that those affected by a decision should 
b
e involved in making it. Our leadership team meets throughout the year to monitor, plan, and 
implement systems and programs that are aimed at increasing students' academic achievement 
and sense of belonging. Our School Site Council also meets a minimum of 
five times a year to discuss 
our Single School Plan, School Safety Plan, parent and student surveys content and results, and 
various testing results.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the
 
district office.

wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrators.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004.  We report to the board in Septembe

about the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether we had a textbook for eac

course during the 2017

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify
 
our facilities needs over the next decade. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
the Facili
ties Needs Assessment to plan out the Bond Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assist
 
with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working
 
order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process 
through a program called "Akita Box" is used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, t
he maintenance department 

 
on routine repairs and enhancements.
 
 
Juniper School is located in the Parkview neighborhood in central Redding. Our campus was originally built in 1958. During th
e 2007

2008 school year, 
we rebuilt the school library to house one of the finest libraries 
in northern California. The entire school was repainted, we installed new carpet in the 
junior high wing, we repaved the entire playground, and we stripped and upgraded playground equipment. In 2008

2009, we remodeled the interior 
hallway between the secon
d and third wings and created an intervention/learning center. Additionally, an up
-
to
-
date computer lab was built for use 
during the school day and in the after
-
school program. Juniper also boasts a beautiful, high
-
quality gymnasium on the campus. Other re
cent upgrades 
and additions include a performing arts stage, two softball fields, a soccer field, and cement tables and benches. Students a
nd staff painted a 120
-
foot
-
long mural depicting local history, and we have a new mural and wall coverings in our caf
eteria. A new mural depicting our mascot, the Jaguar, has been 
painted on our Learning Plaza. We also have put in wrought iron fencing around our school in an effort to make our campus mor
e secure. We are proud 
to have an exemplary facilities rating follow
ing an inspection by the Shasta County Office of Education.  Added 2 small parking garages and remodeled 
computer activity room in 2017.  The playground (basketball court area) was resurfaced and repainted in 2019.  The roofs on b
oth the North and South 
wi
ngs were refurbished in Fall of 2019.

The school is staffed with one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to en

which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a monthly basis the lead custodian uses a facility survey instrum
ent developed by the Northern 
Californi
a Schools Insurance to evaluate the conditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the District Facilities De
partment who then does 
an annual evaluation for the site.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parental and community involvement is critical to student success and volunteers are always w
elcome on our campus. The number of volunteers at 
Juniper School has fluctuated over the years as enrollment has changed. Parents can help by participating in school events, f
undraising, or serving on the 
School Site Council or the Parent Club. The Parent 
Club holds monthly meetings to discuss upcoming events and fundraisers. We invite parents and

ide a safe c
ampus and 
community. The safety of our students and staff is a high priority.

Safe, respectful, and responsible student behavior is a priority at Juniper. We expect all s
tudents to act in an appropriate manner in classrooms and 
common areas such as the playground, cafeteria, and hallways. We use Second Step Social Skills Program, have buddy classrooms
, a Wellness center, 
school counselor and behavior specialist to help tea
ch our students appropriate behaviors. Students are expected to follow the rules.  We use a referral 
system to track behaviors and areas we need to focus on for safety.  Suspensions are used sparingly and for serious offenses.
  
Our goal is to teach student
s 
to self
-
regulate and manage behavior.  We reward proper behavior on a daily basis through our morning rally.  Our staff is trained to
 
use the practices of 
social emotional learning and strong academic teaching techniques and strategies for great first in
struction.  We strive to maintain a positive learning 
environment. We communicate with parents about discipline issues on a regular basis.
