Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

ur goal is to inspire learning and foster success for all 
students, in a caring school community with involved staff, committed to a goal of excellence in teaching.  In collaboration 
with parents and the educational community, we strive to meet each studen
t's needs 
-
 
academic, social, emotional and 
physical. We recognize, respect, and develop each student's unique potential.  Our curriculum and instructions are aligned 
with National, State and District Standards and we measure our achievement through standa
rdized assessments. We 
provide a flexible learning environment that prepares our students for the challenges of a changing world.
 
 

for th
eir efforts as well as their achievement by giving rewards at break, at lunch, and at our trimester Renaissance Rallies. 
Another wonderful component of our school is the Family Resource Center (FRC), which provides assistance and resources 
for families. Th
e FRC is also a haven at lunch time, break, and after school for students. The FRC facilitates case 
management for students, including connecting families to county resources and acting as a liaison between parents and 
school. The FRC monitors grades, beha
vior, and attendance for at
-
risk students. They also provide supervision of 
recreational activities and translation services in Spanish and Hmong.
 
 
The atmosphere on the Wheatland Elementary campus is calm, positive and nurturing. We invite parents and com
munity 
volunteers to join us in the education of our students. It is our goal to partner with families to create the best educationa
l 
environment possible for our students. Our wonderful students, families, and dedicated teaching team and support staff 
mak
e our school a fabulous place to work and learn.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The campus was originally opened in 1963.  It is a 
beautiful, tree
-
lined campus. The campus has a wide
-
open feel and is 
equipped with appropriate lighting and security cameras in strategic areas to promote safety.  Wheatland Elementary has 
site established cleaning standards with two full
-
time custodians a
nd one half
-
time custodian. The campus is always well 
maintained and classrooms and bathrooms are cleaned daily. The Principal and Lead Custodian do routine walks of the 
campus to identify items that need to be repaired, replace or improved.  An ongoing do
cument is kept to monitor projects 
and ensure completion.  Minor repairs to the carpet and door lockdown latches are necessary due to usual wear and tear. 
In the 2018
-
2019 school year four classrooms had their carpeting replaced.  Our continual plan for im
provement plans for 
ofur more rooms to have carpeting replaced each year.  There is adequate room for all students in classrooms, on the 
playground, and in the eating areas. We have a fully functioning kitchen and multipurpose room with plenty of tables an
d 
room to sit. Our multi
-
purpose room is used for school sports programs, community sports programs and for community 
events. There is room behind our campus for future expansion of our school or for sports fields and other extracurricular 
activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

All teachers and noon duty supervisors are scheduled so that at least two monitors are on 
duty during each recess. We 
provide before school, during school, and after school supervision. Safety drills are held once per month rotating Fire 
Drills, Earthquake drills, and Lockdown drills throughout the year. The Safety Committee reviews and approve
s our school 
Safety Plan each October. We distribute the plan to each teacher and it is reviewed and approved by the School Site 
Council. We work collaboratively with the Wheatland Fire and Police Departments to coordinate emergency plans. The

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
This section provides information on the annual number of 
school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent 
three
-
year period.
 
 
Wheatland Elementary School and the Wheatland School District are dedicated to the educational development of 
teachers and staff.  Six staff development minimum days are sch
eduled yearly, designed to enhance the educational 
experience of our students.  During after school workshops, staff evaluate student data to develop a continuing 
educational plan that meets the needs of the constantly changing student population.  Teacher
s tackle the areas of the 

to develop a program that educates the whole student.  In addition to these on campus opportunities, our staff 
attend 
best practice conferences including topics from 504 Plan and special education law, as well as county developed trainings 
focused on integrating the California Common Core State Standards with a variety of student learners and learning 
modalities.  
The Wheatland Elementary School team works hard to collaborate with campus staff and surrounding 
communities to develop an exemplary academic program.
 
 
Teachers are supported throughout the implementation process through a combination of peer led trainings
 
and 
meetings, as well as administrative observations.  Data is evaluated often to ensure the continued growth of our programs 
and provide opportunities to address student needs through our continued professional development.  During the current 
school yea
r, professional development has been provided during Staff Development Days for the initial implementation 
of a PBIS system of Positive Behavioral Intervention Systems.
