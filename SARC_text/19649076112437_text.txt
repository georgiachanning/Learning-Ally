By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 
Novembe
r 1988. The Report Card, issued annually by school boards for each public school in the state, provides for parents 
and other interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and areas in which 
improvement is neede

future. Our staff is outstanding in leadership, instructional abilities, and concern for students. Each employee at our schoo
l 
has the best interests of your
 
children at heart. I hope you will find this report informative and beneficial. If you would like 
additional information on any of these areas, please feel free to call my office at 397

this report! Principal, Selene Amanc

Many individuals and groups provide support for the educational program at San Antonio School. Parents attend classes 
on campus , and monthly topics on helping their children at home. The PTA sponsors parent 
education (School Smarts 
Academy), fund raising, educational and cultural assemblies, and it promotes school spirit in the community. This school 
year San Antonio, supported by the PTA, provided educational field trips to all students. Local businesses and
 
individuals 
enrich our school program through direct donations of goods and services. Students also benefit from a significant number 
of parent volunteers who share their special talents by working in the classroom and assisting in special activities.

Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the 
district 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Staff attended a training on 
October 13, 2016 and a disaster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. All buildings 
within th
e district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy may be found at each school that 
seeks to insure a safe and orderly environment for students and staff. In addition, San Antonio is a PBIS school and 
encourages positive beha
vior in all of our students. A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes policies on 
disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and orderly school environment, 
suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, child abuse reporting
 
procedures, student dress codes, and student and staff 
sexual harassment. Our after school program, the Learning Center (TLC), is provided for up to 80 students in grades 1
