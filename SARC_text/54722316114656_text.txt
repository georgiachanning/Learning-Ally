Annual School
-
wide Plan Review
 
The Heritage School
-
wide Plan is aligned to the Tulare City School District LEA plan. Our school plan 
has been revised
 
this year to reflect the current needs assessment. It also reflects the most recent 
state and federal accountability data and goals we must obtain. This plan was developed 
collaboratively with staff and the school community and is the guide that is used f
or budget 
expenditures and instructional program implementation.  Examination of test data has provided 
insight to guide staff development with the purpose of improving language arts and math 
instruction. Heritage Elementary staff members continue to provi
de a challenging core curriculum 
to all students and offer intervention instruction to those students who are deemed not proficient 
according to the State of California.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Heritage School has a Safe School Plan in place and is updated yearly by the School Safety Committee, an offshoot of the Scho
ol Site Council. Evacuation 
drills are scheduled on a regular basis
 
to ensure that staff and students know what to do in case of an emergency. A Cal
-
OSHA representative attends 
monthly meetings and provides updates to staff on safety and health issues. In addition to these programs, adequate supervisi
on is provided before
 
school, during break/recess, at lunch, and after school, and is noted on the school's duty schedule. All school district faci
lities are supportive of teaching 
and learning. Classrooms are clean and orderly and provide a safe learning environment reflectiv
e of student work and current curriculum. Our school 
cafeteria provides students with a breakfast and lunch program and it is used as a multipurpose facility for large
-
scale programs and meetings. The library 
provides students with supplemental reading mat
erials and provides additional educational resources. The school grounds are kept clean and well 
maintained for student play, recreation, and athletic activities. Staff members and students take pride in the well
-
maintained buildings and landscaping. 
The T
ulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe and clean environment throughout the school year. S
tudents, staff, and 
parents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter free. The District provides ongoing maintenance, a
nd routine and major repairs for all 
structures to guarantee all schools are in good working order and condition. Restroom facilities for pupils are maintained so
 
that they are functional and 
meet local hygiene standards generally applicable to public faci
lities, including operational toilets and sinks in all restrooms. The District has established 
a facilities inspection system to ensure all school buildings meet the standard above. The school grounds, buildings, and res
trooms are kept clean and 
safe and a
re regularly maintained. We have a morning custodian from 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 
9:00 P.M. 
Custodians are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building principal and director of custodians to make sure the bu
ilding is safely maintained and 
cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, the district has general maintenance crews that take care of more tec
hnical repairs (plumbing, 
heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, painting, major repairs, an
d so on). At times, the district will hire an independent contractor to handle repairs 
that may be beyond the scope of the district's resources. Repairs are made on an ongoing basis, and the district has a work o
rder repair procedure that 
begins with the s
chool principal referring needed repairs that cannot be taken care of by the site custodians to the district superintendent. 
The 
superintendent assigns the repairs to the maintenance director who, in turn, assigns the work out to the different maintenanc
e 
specialists. Work orders 
are completed on a timely basis. Heritage School was constructed in 2003 on approximately 330,000 square feet of property. Th
e school facilities and 
classrooms measure approximately 52,240 square feet, and all areas and buildings a
re handicapped accessible. Our library contains 17,088 books that 
are available for student, staff, and community circulation. Modern technology is used throughout the campus including 80 Int
ernet
-
connected 
computers for instructional purposes.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
