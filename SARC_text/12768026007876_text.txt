By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
South Fortuna Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for its students. One full
-
time custodian and two 
half
-
time custodians maintain our facilities. Our school has complete
d modernization for a small portion of rooms using 
state funds and has provided handicap accessible restrooms, handicap accessible rampways, energy
-
efficient lighting, 
cabinets, tile & carpeted flooring, electrical outlets, modem lines, and projectors and 
document cameras in those 
classrooms. Additionally, Chromebooks have been purchased to enhance instruction in all grade levels. All students in 
first, second, third, and fourth
-
grade have their own Chromebook. Seven modular buildings have been added to sup
port 
increased enrollment and additional programs. We have a new heating system and energy
-
efficient lighting.
 
 
Passage of a local bond in November 2018 will allow the district to complete several much
-
needed modernization projects 
on the site during the s
ummer of 2020. Projects will likely include reskinning existing classroom wings, replacing windows, 
interior upgrades in the classrooms, kitchen, and multipurpose room, and enhancing student support and office spaces.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
