About the SARC
 
By Februa
ry 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundin
g Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state an
d local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the scho
ol, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019
-
20)
 
The success of children depends heavily on the school community, parents, and extended community working together. The benefi
ts of these 
partnerships are immeasurable. Communication between home and school is regular, two
-
way, and meaningf
ul. Parents receive weekly updates and/or 
progress reports from the classroom teacher, monthly school calendars, weekly calls home and newsletters. Official and classr
oom notices are sent home 
in English and Spanish. Parent conferences are held twice per y
ear with follow
-
up meetings as needed.
 
 
Parents play an integral role in assisting student learning. Parents are provided information regarding how parents can foste
r learning at home, give 
homework assistance, and provide feedback to teachers. School sp
onsored workshops are held on a regular basis to assist parents in understanding how 
students can improve skills, get help when needed, meet class expectations, and perform well on assessments. Math night, Dr. 
Seuss Night, family game 
night, and many other
 
events are held each year to provide opportunities for families to come learn and have fun together at Jackson Heights.
 
 
Parents are welcome in the school and their support and assistance are sought. Parents are full partners in decisions that af
fect ch
ildren and families. 
Open dialogue, both formally and informally, is encouraged through an active School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Co
mmittee, (District), English 
Learner Advisory Committee, and Parent Teacher Club. Lastly, community resources 
are used to strengthen schools, families and student learning. 
Jackson Heights Elementary School works in partnerships with local business and service groups (Baskin Robbins; Rotary; Wal
-
Mart.). A dedicated Family 
Resource Center is operating on campus whi
ch allows parents to have a centralized room to perform volunteer work, provide information on available 
services through the school and community, as well as a food pantry and clothing storehouse for families in need.

Types of Services Funded
 
The district's general fund includes funding for:
 

 
General Operations: salaries, benefits, services, and materials
 

 
Special Education: programs offering 
appropriate, individualized instruction to students with special needs
 

 
Transportation
 

 
Maintenance and Operations
 

 
Special Projects: any monies from agencies (federal or state) earmarked for specific programs, projects or services
 
Each school receives an ins
tructional budget based on enrollment, programs, and formulas set by Board of Education policy, state law, agreements with 
bargaining units, and guidelines of outside funding sources. The School Site Council (SSC) meets approximately once a month t
o develo
p, implement, 
monitor, and evaluate the school plan for student achievement. School plans align with the district's Local Control Accountab
ility Plan (LCAP). Parent 
representatives are elected to the School Site Council and serve two year terms. All parent
s are welcome and encouraged to attend these meetings, as 
well as the District Advisory Committee (DAC) meetings, as a way to learn more about our school funding and academic goals. 
 
 
DataQuest

ata tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifi
cally, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is 
available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access t
o the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions 
may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print 
documents.
