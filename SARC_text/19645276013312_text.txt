About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w

page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Fa
cility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Durfee Elementary School first opened its doors in 1951. There are twenty permanent classrooms, six bungalow rooms, a cafeter
ia/multipurpose room, 
and an administration building.
 
 
Through modern
ization efforts, the school was made accessible to students with disabilities. Many of the classrooms and bathrooms were also
 
upgraded. 
The asphalt was resurfaced and marked with new play areas. The placement of new equipment for the large playground area 
was completed after many 
years of anticipation.
 
 
The library has an abundance of books, and it is also connected to the Internet. This extension of the instructional program 
provides the Accelerated 
Reader supplemental literacy program.
 
 
All classrooms, of
fices, restrooms, and lunch areas are cleaned daily. On a weekly basis, the District grounds crew perform special tasks as re
quested by 
the school site to upgrade all areas. If more detailed repair is required, it is referred to as the District operations 
department.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for 
Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Durfee parents are welcome partners in the education of our students. We invite our parents to actively participate in school
 
events, programs, and 
classrooms. Some of the many ways parents can become involved are
 
through our Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), the English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), School Site Council (SSC), Parent Education Opportunities, Mental Health Counseling and classroom volunteer
s/room parents. They 
are also encouraged to attend all
 
of our No Excuses University activities. We encourage parents to become school volunteers. Parents are informed about 
the school program through our school Web site, school flyers, phone broadcast messages, quarterly newsletter, and the Studen
t/Parent Han
dbook. For 
more information on how to become involved at the school, please contact Principal Kendall Goyenaga at (562) 801

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each year, the School Emergency Response Plan is reviewed, updated, and presented to the school faculty in the Fall. It was l
ast reviewed and presented 
in Augu

 
threats, and any 
other emergency situations. In large part, the emergency plan revolves around first responses, evacuation procedu
res, first aid procedures, and how the 
staff ensures the safety of all students and staff in any given disaster situation. The application aspect of the plan is the
n held through monthly practice 
drills occurring each month for fire, and every other month 
for disaster and earthquake safety.
 
 
The SERT flowchart defines the roles as well as 
locations and regulations the staff will follow to ensure the safety of all students, staff, and parents at 
Durfee. These individuals play key roles in how each disaster drill is handled. The plan also includes shut
-
off locations for gas, electricity, and 
water. 
Provided by the district and housed on our campus, a large metal bin houses all emergency supplies. In the end, the plan will
 
provide all the terms and 
routines with which the staff will efficiently conduct the necessary procedures to be able to saf
ely reunite each student with his/her parents/guardians. 
During monthly emergency drills, the staff reviews the entire plan to ensure the system works.
 
 
The Durfee campus is closed, and all visitors are required to report to the office before entering any 
part of the school, including during the after
-
school 
program time.

The district provides professional learning opportunities to meet the needs of administrators, teachers, and support staff at
 
all levels of the organization: 
Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment (BTSA); Peer Assistance Review (PAR) for veteran teacher
s; District and site administrators; Teachers and 
support staff; and Digital Learning Coaches.
 
 
Three full days and approximately 18 half days of professional learning were offered at our school sites in the 2018
-
19 school year. The topics addressed 
were b

-
wide action plans. Our intern teachers are 
supported by university supervisors. Professional development at individual school sites is determined by in
-
dep
th data analysis and aligned to the 
instructional focus areas. English learners and special population training are offered on
-
site as needed. In addition, teachers and support staff also 
attend off
-
site workshops or conferences.
 
 
2018
-
19 Analysis of data 
led to the identification of professional learning priorities. Whole group instruction, small group differentiated instructio
n, and 
designated English language development supported strengthening language arts instruction at the elementary level. Professio
nal learning in 
mathematics focused on the Standards for Mathematics Practice, in conjunction with problem
-
solving and modeling and data analysis at the middle 
school level. At the high school, professional learning was prioritized for the Expository Readi
ng and Writing Course which develops students' academic 
literacy in rhetorical and analytical reading, writing, and thinking. All schools participated in professional learning oppor
tunities centered on data literacy. 
Professional development is provided du
ring modified day schedules, pupil
-
free days, release days, and conferences/workshops outside the district. 
Professional learning is supported through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, observations, and demonstration lessons.
