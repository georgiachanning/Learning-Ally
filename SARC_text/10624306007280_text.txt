By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Indianola is very 
fortunate to have the support of our parents and the extended community in the development of our 
program. We offer a variety of opportunities for parents and community members to become involved in our programs. 
We encourage you to consider some of the fo
llowing opportunities to become an involved member:
 

 
Classroom volunteers
 

 
English Learner Advisory Council
 

 
Library
 

 
Parent Club
 

 
Fundraisers
 

 
Supervisory volunteers (cross guard, hallways, etc.)
 

 
Field trips
 

 
Intramurals
 
Activities at the school are shared via m
onthly newsletters from the Principal, monthly newsletters from the students, and 
frequent dialers home. The Parent Club is the most active and offers the most diverse opportunities for involvement.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan is reviewed annually with a team of people that includes administration, teachers, parents, and 
community members. The Safety Plan was 
reviewed in November
-
December, 2019 with select staff. In December, 2019 
the select team members reviewed the current plan and made revisions to the plan. The purpose of the plan is to prepare 
for emergency situations should they ever arise and provide ord
erly processes to keep activities safe and running 
smoothly. Specific plans are in place so the site can respond effectively and safely to the many possible situations that can
 
arise. The ultimate goal is to keep all of our students and staff safe even in 
the midst of an emergency situation should it 
ever arise. Input into this plan is always welcome and is available for your review at the front office.

Selma Unified School District supports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through a Site Based Coaching 
model.  This model allows for job embedded Professional learning by implementing the tenets of the Professional Learning 
Community framewor
k. The district maintains a ELA/ELD, Math and Science coaching team that in turn support and 
provide instructional support for our site level coaching team. In collaboration with both teams, professional learning for 
teachers is provided to assist all stud
ents in achieving the State academic standards, with an emphasis on addressing and 
supporting student groups requiring additional resources; groups such as Foster Youth, English Learners, and 
Students 
with Disabilities.
 
 
The District also provides all 
teachers with three professional learning days throughout the year.  These are non
-
student 
days that are planned and facilitated by site leaders and site coaches.  For the last couple of years, these days focus on 
allowing teachers time for instructional p
lanning as they apply to the California Standards for the Teacher Profession 
(CSTPs 3, 4, & 5).
