School Description
 
The mission of Meadows Elementary School is to support students to achieve high academic 
standards and to build strong character as 21st century learners in a global society. Behind this 
mission are committed efforts to 
support the whole child and to provide students with an enriching, 
challenging and motivating instructional program that stimulates their curiosity about new ideas, 
encourages them to think creatively and engenders a joy of learning. Our work is fueled by 
a 
commitment to prepare all students for responsible citizenship in a global society. These efforts are 
supported through partnerships and with collaboration amongst staff, students, families, and the 
community. As educational partners working together for
 
the success of all students, the highest 
priority is placed upon helping children acquire a love of learning. The school provides a positive 
and safe learning environment to facilitate the rigorously rich program available for all Meadows 
Elementary Stude
nts.
 
 
Our staff is dedicated to providing an academically rigorous curriculum in core instructional areas 
including English Language Arts, mathematics, social studies, and science. We have identified the 
areas of English Language Arts and Positive Behavior
 
Interventions and Supports as our focus for 
differentiated instruction for all students. Diversity is evident in our school. Over one
-
third of our 

provides 
our school with a richness of diversity as well as challenges to help every student achieve. 
We have an English Learners program that emphasizes English immersion and English Language 
Development (ELD). Students receive instruction from our teachers, all o
f whom have Cross
-
cultural 
Language and Academic Development (CLAD) certification or its equivalent. Students identified as 
needing assistance receive additional help from their teacher or an instructional aide. We are 
fortunate to have a PTO that donates 
a great deal to the school by providing funding for field trips, 
school assemblies, equipment for the school, and supplies and materials for our classrooms and 
teachers. The PTO members have committed the time, effort, and resources needed to make our 
scho
ol successful. We value the parental support we enjoy and realize the partnership with parents 
has been a critical element in the success of Meadows. We invite you to visit our  school and 
become part of the Meadows community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

e moved onto the campus 
following class
-
size reduction in the late 1990s to
 

lighting, heating, teacher work areas, and washrooms were updated. Parents take pride in their school, and semiannual landsca
ping and cleanup projects
 
keep the school grounds attractive and deserving of community pride. A daily custodian works diligently to keep the facilitie
s clean. On alternate nights, 
an additional custodian completes the cleaning of the building. The crossing guard, safe cross flag

ts school system. Parents actively support the schools in a variety of ways. Parents attend school events 
including parent
-
teacher conferences, Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, the Annual Crab Feed, and parent education sessions. Meadows School also 
has a
 
very active Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), Room Parent Program, School Site Council (SSC), and English Language Advisory 
Committee (ELAC). 
Teachers provide many opportunities for parents to volunteer. Parents support field trips, class projects, and s
chool events. Volunteers help in the 
classroom; work with students; and volunteer in the computer lab. In addition, parents help with yard duty, technology and co
mputers, and a variety of 
special projects. There are also opportunities for parents to get in
volved on district level committees to represent Meadows School. These opportunities 
include formal groups such as the Millbrae Education Foundation (MEF) and the District Advisory Committee, as well as ad hoc 
groups such as the allergy 
policy development 
advisory committee.

School Safety Plan
 

n is updated regularly. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground. I
n 
addition, playgrounds are supervised and students are taught rules for student conduct to create a safe environment. Visitors
 
mus
t sign in at the office, 
where they receive a badge to wear throughout their stay. Emergency preparedness is a high priority in the Millbrae School Di
strict. Each school, in 
collaboration with the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, the San Mateo County Off
ice of Education, and the County Fire Department, has developed 
and implemented a School Safety Plan that provides emergency response and procedures in the event of need. The School Safety 
Plan is reflective of the 
San Mateo County Big Five Emergency Respo
nses including Lockdown/Barricade, Evacuation, Drop, Cover and Hold On, Secure Campus, and Shelter in 
Place. Meadows School has regular emergency drills that provide students and staff the opportunity to practice the big five e
mergency responses. Each 
clas
sroom has an emergency safety kit containing basic first aid supplies and student emergency contact information. Additionally
, the district has trained 
staff in the safe use and disposal of EpiPens, AED machines, and CPR to facilitate quick and appropriate
 
responses to emergencies. Meadows School has 

lies. The community focuses 
on public safety through the offering of free Community E
mergency Response Team (CERT) Training. Two staff people have completed the free CERT 
training available through the Millbrae Community.
