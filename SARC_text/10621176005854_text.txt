As you read this School Accountability Report Card (SARC), I believe you will find a picture of a 
thriving school community that has experienced broad success in the education of its students. Our 
faculty is 
professionally skilled and personally committed to meeting the learning needs of all 
students. Our students are disciplined, motivated and proud of their school. Parents of Dry Creek 
Elementary school students continue to provide great support through volu
nteerism and 
fundraising. Dry Creek was founded in 1866, and over its long history has established a tradition of 
high standards wherein our students and staff strive for academic excellence and self
-
improvement. Our team is especially proud of the strong 
academic performance of our students, 

Distinguished School in 2014. In 2016, the Bonner Center for Character Education at California State 
University, Fresno h
onored Dry Creek with the Character and Civic Education Award. These awards 
reflect the dedication and commitment of staff, students and parents working together to make 
Dry Creek a special place to learn.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The current Dry Creek campus is 62 years old, although the school traces its history to 1866. We provide a clean, safe learni
ng environment. Our 
custodians perform basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, we cond
uct deep cleaning twice a year. Our SART 
committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis 
to provide feedback to our student body. Individual classes also as
sist with keeping the campus clean on a rotating basis.
 
 

 

munity awareness, school pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope 
to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low.
 
 
The Dry Creek campus consists of the following structures, which adequately support the instructional program. The original c
afeteria was 
limited in 
seating capacity and required staggered lunch periods. A new multi
-
use room became operational in August 2007, and it is a much larger and fully modern 
facility. The library media center (LMC) houses a substantial book collection and a computer 
lab with 36 refreshed laptop workstations.
 
 
With the use of 21 classrooms and 12 portables, we house and are able to support the instruction of 915 students during the 2
018
-
19 school year.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes schools are the hub of thei
r neighborhoods. As a result, we place a high priority on building and maintaining excellent 
facilities as economically as possible.
 
 
On June 5, 2012, voters within the Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) approved Measure A, a $298 million bond measure. 
Funds from Measure A were 
used primarily to upgrade existing facilities, with a smaller percentage directed toward construction of new schools. Specifi
c plans for Dry Creek included 
installation of a solar
-
energy project, a remodel of kindergarten classroo
ms and student restrooms, technology infrastructure (video surveillance, phone 
system, fire alarm and network) upgrades, landscaping and irrigation work, new doors and windows for all classrooms, and vari
ous site improvements. 
All of these projects were co
mpleted during 2014.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Dry Creek has a school safety plan and School Crisi

The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mast
ery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Conte
nt Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-

the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities on staff 
devel
opment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional deve
lopment and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Lear

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

istics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from econo
mically disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not genera
lly provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial suppor
t to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additi
onal assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
acti
vities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to chal
lenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
