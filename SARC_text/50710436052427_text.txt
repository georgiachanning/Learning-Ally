By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbo
oks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards

. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the 
district office prior 
to adoption.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is an emphasis in Ceres Unified School District. The District's Educational Services Division has 
coordinated staff development for all staff. Aligning the current State Standards to the existing curriculum is a priority fo
r 
sta
ff in
-
service. The District also has instructional coaches available to assist and support teachers. Ceres Unified provides 
staff development to institute Google Chrome and Google Drive programs to assist staff with collaboration and prepare 
all CUSD staff
 
for students utilizing individual technological devices.
 
 
Through various avenues of training and in
-
services, the Carroll Fowler staff identifies strategies for improving student 
achievement and reviewing current and new teaching strategies and methods. 
They work with the District to process, 
develop, and implement comprehensive, standards
-
based core programs that provide coordinated interventions for 
students not meeting standards
-
based benchmarks. Opportunities are provided to refine curriculum based on
 
the state 
standards in reading, writing, science, social studies and math. Ongoing staff training is provided in the use and 
maintenance of technology to meet the needs of increased use of computers throughout the curriculum.

nt to standards, assessed student performance, and professional needs:

and additional research based student centered topics.
 
* The district's Strategic Plan addresses the area of staff development and provides a list of district
-
wide and site
-
based 
activities.
 
 
Staff development is a critical component to teacher and studen
t success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for staff. Every other Monday after school is dedicated to grade 
level meeting times for teachers to collaborate, learn strategies, and develop
 
action plans to meet identified student 
needs. In addition, teachers have monthly scheduled staff meetings with a set agenda. Topics discussed include EL teaching 
strategies, planning for the differentiated instruction time, analyzing data, and planning g
rade level curriculum and 
activities. The Leadership Team meets on a bi
-
monthly basis to discuss issues related to school instructional programs, 
scheduling, and student incentives. Grade level groups are also provided with up to six teacher release days p
er year to 
work with a district coach on breaking down standards, developing curriculum and assessments, and data based 
interventions. 
 
 
The staff development plan concentrates on implementation of district and state standards, especially in the subjects o
f 
language arts and math. Objectives also include effective teaching strategies, Learning Centered Schools, Family 
Engagement Strategies, and accessing and using technology. Staff attends conferences and workshops to broaden their 
scope of instructional st
rategies and augment curriculum. Staff members also use time during staff meetings to 
disseminate valuable information that was presented at a conference or seminar. 
 
 
The goal of all professional development is to increase student achievement.
