School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In 2016, Hoover School re
-
opened it's doors after being closed for 43 years.  This gave us the unique opportunity to build 
a school community from the ground up.  Our overarching goals at that time continue to be o
ur focus three years later.
 
1.
 
To build an inclusive community where students and parents feel welcome and part of the process.
 
2.
 
To create a nurturing and safe place for students to learn.
 
3.
 
To build a strong academic program coupled with an emphasis on 
inspiration, self discovery, creativity and 
teamwork.
 
4.
 
To prepare students for a modern world yet maintaining the spirit of community and connection to the past.
 
 
At the start of our opening school year, we asked students, staff and parents to brainstorm wo
rds and short statements 
that we hoped would best describe our new school. These conversations and community experiences led to the creation 
of our vision 
-
 
"Hoover Hawks ~ Together We Soar" 
-
 
believing that with a strong community, we can accomplish all t
hat 
we set out to do.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Hoover, there are many opportunities for parents to be involved.  On a formal level, we have an official PTA with an 
Executive Board and several committee positions and opportunities to volunteer.  The focus of our PTA is community 
building and many of 
our events focus on bringing the students and families together.  We also have a Dad's Club that 
works with the PTA to sponsor events and initiatives in the school.  School Site Council is a team of parents and staff who 
guide our school plan and monitor t
he progress of our academic and social emotional goals.  On any given day, parents 
can be seen on campus volunteering in classrooms, in the workroom, on the yard, on field trips and in the library 
-
 
parents/grandparents are a big part of our school and are
 
always welcome on campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our School Safety Plan is updated annually and reviewed by the entire staff at the start of each school year.  Copies of the 
plan are available in the school office and in all classrooms and include BIG 5 procedures for evacuations, supervision and 
drill s
chedules, school goals and board policies relating to safety.  Parents are notified of the plan through our student 
handbook, at Back to School Night and in our school bulletin 
-
 
particularly when it comes to communication and reuniting 
with their children
 
during an emergency. The plan is reviewed and approved each year by our School Site Council and 
Board of Trustees.
 
 
Every classroom in the school has a red emergency backpack that includes all of the equipment set forth in the plan (ie: 
first aid kit, cla
ss lists, emergency contact numbers, flashlights, drill procedures).  Each month we practice our safety drills 
with the Central County Fire Department and local law enforcement.  The firefighters are also on campus for a Fire Safety 
Workshop in the fall an
d to work with our junior fire marshals throughout the school year.

We believe that ongoing professional development is the hallmark of our educational system in Burlingame. Teachers and 
administrators review student achievement data and choose topics relating to the most pressing issues from the previous 
year. Our teacher
s attend conferences outside the district and workshops within the district. Faculty meetings include 
professional development activities, and the staff collaborate on a regular basis.
