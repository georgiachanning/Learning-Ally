By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
John Muir was a naturalist and an important part of establishing Yosemite National Park. His love for nature and his selfless
 
acts to preserve it, along with his major influence on California and the Merced area in particular, were the reasons b
ehind 

follows a traditional calendar and serves children in preschool through sixth grade. Muir lies in the central part of the cit
y
 
of Merced. Most students live within walking distance of school, how ever, children who currently live within an 
"unhoused" Loughborough area, are bused to Muir daily. Most students graduating 6th grade from Muir, will attend 
nearby Herbert Hoover Middle 
School. Others will attend either, Cruickshank, Tenaya or Rivera Middle Schools. As it s 
priority the entire staff of Muir strives to meet the social, emotional, and physical needs of students. Local and state 
assessments are analyzed at the beginning of e
ach school year. Muir Elementary School is dedicated to ensuring that its 
students come away with a well 
-
rounded, academically rigorous educational experience that will serve them well in the 
future. We are a school where everyone is special and learning 
is celebrated and encouraged as a lifelong experience.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In 
2001, the district designed a 20
-
year strategic plan, which includes agendas for modernization, renovation, and 
upgrading of various areas for each school site. For Muir Elementary School, the plan included a need for five new portable 
classrooms, which we
re added to the school during the 2002
-
03 academic year. These classrooms housed the New comers' 
Academy. These Hmong students have now been infused into the regular elementary and middle school class settings. 
The Merced County Office of Education's ASSET
S Program uses these 4 classrooms every day from the end of school until 
6:00 PM. Additionally, 2 new portables were purchased using the QEIA grant, in order to lower 4th and 5th grade class 
sizes to 26:1. School facilities were built in 1924. As of Novemb
er 2007, the campus includes a library media center, 
multipurpose room, 14 permanent classrooms, and 17 portable classrooms, which are all up to date and provide adequate 
space for students and staff. During the 2010
-
11 school year, a restroom was added al
ong with a Youth Enrichment 
Program portable building which is owned by the City of Merced. In 2011 our school was renovated with fresh paint and 
new HVAC units. Floor coverings were replaced in one classroom during 2013. Two portable classrooms were added
 
in 
2014
-
15. Upgrades made during 2015
-
16 include the installation of new surveillance equipment and roofing for the 
administration building and cafeteria. Re
-
roofing of the kindergarten classroom wing and drinking fountain refurbishment 
occurred during 20
16
-
2017. Installation of LED lighting in all classrooms and exterior walkways and construction of energy 
savings solar array were part of campus site improvements during 2017
-
2018. 2018
-
19 upgrades include the installation 
of 25 new energy efficient packag
es and heat
-
pump units. The Facility Inspection occurred on 9/3/19.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety plan is revised and updated annually. Administrators, staff, and the School Site Council 
review the plans 
and policies at the beginning of each school year. The School Safety Plan was designed to assist in preparing for 
emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and in maintaining a safe school environment. Safety of students 
and staff 
is a primary concern of John Muir Elementary School. The school works diligently to maintain safety compliance 
with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. All John Muir 
visitors are required to ch
eck in at the office before entering the campus. Office staff regularly reviews registration cards 
of students to ensure that only identified adults have access to any John Muir student. The school safety plan was 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with scho
ol faculty and a student representative on October 30, 2019.
