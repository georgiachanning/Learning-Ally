By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Profiles
 
Gravenstein Union School District is a Tra
nsitional Kindergarten through 8th
-
grade school district with an enrollment of 
approximately 750 students, most of whom come from English speaking homes with a variety of socio
-
economic 
backgrounds. The district is located in the western rural section of S
ebastopol in Western Sonoma County. The District 
serves a primarily rural population in an area of limited growth. Approximately ninety
-
four percent of the property located 

unty General Plan. This zoning 
classification also affects the number of students living within the district.
 
 
There are four schools in the district. Gravenstein Elementary School is a TK
-
5 charter school with the exception of some 
first
-
grade classes (ca
lled Gravenstein First School). Hillcrest Middle School is a 6th 
-
 
8th
-
grade middle school which is a 
charter school, and the district also has a Community Day School. The District is a TK
-
8 Magnet Program due to the ENRICH! 
program.
 
 
The sites reflect the
 
rural nature of the community. The relatively low teacher: student ratio at each site, excellent staff, 
and very involved parents have worked together to establish a student body that has achieved some of the highest 
standardized test scores in Sonoma Cou
nty for the last 15 years.
 
 
All classes TK
-
5 are self
-
contained. Primary classes (TK
-
3) have an approximate student:teacher ratio of 20:1 and in grades 
4
-
5, we have an approximate ratio of 24:1. Instructional support assistants, paid by categorical monies,
 
are utilized in 
Grades TK
-
8 according to need in the classroom. Instructional assistants work in conjunction with the Special Education 
Teachers to instruct in Learning Labs at both campuses. The Learning Labs are operated through combining categorical 
fu
nding to serve students who need intervention or tutoring. Students are provided service according to their need 

 
regardless of whether they qualify for special education or not. This setting provides additional services in the areas of 
Reading/Language A
rts and Math to identified and/or below
-
grade
-
level students. Other services available to Gravenstein 
Union School District students (on both campuses) include the Speech and Language Program, an academic counselor, 
and a school psychologist.
 
 
Students in 
grades TK through 3 receive music instruction one day per week and students in grades 4 and 5 receive music 
instruction twice a week. Visual art is also part of the Gravenstein School program and all students receive weekly art 
instruction.  Hillcrest Midd
le School has a variety of scheduled music, art and drama programs. All grade levels participate 
in regular field trips and enrichment classes.
 
 
The school district utilizes a social
-
emotional learning program (SEL) entitled Second Step.  Empathy, Emotion 
Management, Impulse Control, Problem Solving, and Anger Management are some of the topics covered.
 
 
Thank you for your interest in our schools.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This school has 28 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building 
-
 
which includes the district 
office. With two campuses, the district employs three full
-
time custodial and maintenance professionals. The district works 
proactively to provide safe, clean, and a
dequate facilities. Deferred Maintenance projects are continually planned and 
executed (such as replacement of student restroom stalls, toilets, and tile as needed on both campuses.
 
 
Classroom carpet replacement, painting, blacktop and striping of parking l
ots are just a few of the other ongoing projects.
 
 
We have had a modernization or new building project (to remove and replace old modular units) at one of the campuses 
every summer for the last several years. In 2012, the district passed a General Obligati
on Bond for a new building project 
for Hillcrest Middle School campus and modernization project at Gravenstein Elementary.  The Gravenstein Elementary 
School modernization project is in process. Phase 1, which was completed in August of 2015, included new 
roofing, 
sidewalks, and ADA compliance construction. Phase 2 of the modernization began in June of 2016. This part of the 
modernization includes a complete renovation of the student restrooms, heating and lighting in most classrooms, and 
changes to the dis
trict and school offices. Phase 2 was completed at the start of the 2017
-
18 year. Phase 3 began in the 
summer of 2018 and included remodeling the multi
-
purpose room, staff bathrooms, and learning lab classroom with new 
flooring, lighting, and heating syste
m.
 
 
Gravenstein has finished Phase 3 which included renovation of the Gravenstein MPR including new roofing, flooring, fully 
remodeled kitchen, windows, and painting interior and exterior.  Prop 39 improvements which occurred during the school 
year 
include completing the upgrading of lighting to LED throughout the campus.  Additionally, kindergarten classrooms 
received new carpeting during the summer of 2019.  New window coverings were also installed for safety.  Solar for the 
campus has been substan
tially completed for the campus to begin using solar power.  Routine maintenance items were 
performed for items that needed attention or repair.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Gravenstein 
Parent Association (GPA), School Site Council, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning on field trips 
are some of the opportunities available for parental involvement. Fundraising through the foundations and helping 
teachers in class are not the only m
ethods used in volunteering. Many parents share their own talents as a doctor, dentist, 
chef/cook, scientist, artist, poet, foreign language specialist, physical fitness instructor, and more with classroom student
s.   
A Cultural Awareness Committee was for
med in 2019 to offer resources, ideas, and support for various school activities.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the Board of Trustees, Site Council/LCAP Committee, Leadership, and all teachers were 
included in the process to update the LCAP throughout th
e fall. The LCAP was revised and adopted by the board for 2018
-
19, 2019
-
20, and 2020
-
21.
 
 
The Trustees and the Superintendent attended county office workshops regarding LCFF and LCAP. Input on the LCAP was 
solicited via Monday Messages to the Superintenden
t and a series of meetings. It was decided to include individual 
responses to questions to include people who could not attend meetings.  Parent, staff, Board, student, and administrative 
LCAP meetings held 5

beginning of the year. The other 
days are spread monthly throughout the year on student Early Release Days.
 
 
On these days, teachers meet as grade level groups for planning or they have professional development brought to them 
on a school campus.
 
 
During the 2015
-
16 school year, the teacher
s piloted a different math textbook. They continue to utilize the early release 
days to discuss this math program by grade levels.
 
 
During the 2016
-
17 school year, teachers met to select and train in ELA pilot materials; CPR training for all certificated & 
office staff; student achievement data analysis and goal setting; and dual
-
program system inquiry.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year, teacher met to select and train in ELA pilot materials; train in new Frontline sub system; 
plan pro

-
19 school year, teachers met to receive Professional Development on improving social emotion
al 
supports with students; NGSS and STEAM classroom strategies; student achievement data analysis and goal setting and 
comprehensive program planning.
 
 
During the 2019
-

The teachers are also encouraged to attend training outside of the district in the areas of GATE education (CAG 
conferences); Spec
ial Education trainings; STEAM conference; NGSS implementation; CUE conference; additional 
Common Core and Leadership training, etc.
 
 
New teachers also attend BTSA training with district mentor teachers.
 
Additional professional development is provided at s
taff meetings with teachers teaching teachers through demonstration 
lessons.
 
 
Each year, teachers on cycle for evaluation in the school year meet with their site administrator and set professional 
development goals.  Administration works to offer opportunit
ies to attend professional development workshops tied to 
their chosen goals. Teachers were successful in fulfilling their professional development goals for 2018
-
19, which ranged 
from the following examples: developing a Google classroom; offering a scienc
e program aligned with the NGSS; 
implementing the Study Sync curriculum with fidelity; and integrating a mindfulness program into their classroom culture.  
This practice continues for 2019
-
2020 school year.  Many staff have already attended professional de
velopment 
opportunities and shared back to the campus staff at a monthly staff meeting.
