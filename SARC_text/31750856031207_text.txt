School Description
 
School Description 
 
 
Parker Whitney Elementary School is one of seventeen schools in the Rocklin Unified School 
District. The school serves students in kindergarten through sixth grades, with an enrollment of 
about 450. The school is located in the center 
of a stable and supportive community which 
expresses its values toward education through a high level of participation. Parker Whitney 
Elementary School opened in 1965. Kari Auwae is Principal and Roger Stock is District 
Superintendent.
 
 
The staff of 
Parker Whitney Elementary School strives to provide an exemplary learning 
environment. Academic learning is certainly the primary focus of the school, but commendably, the 
staff operates on the principle that a caring environment which fosters self
-
esteem 
and individual 
development is the best road toward realizing such learning. The students are able to approach all 
facets of their learning with confidence and the assurance that this school is their home. Rules of 
conduct are realized internally, leading t
o self
-
directedness and initiative. Finally, the staff 
welcomes the direct involvement of the community in these efforts. This is demonstrated in our 
partnership with our local university, our 9 years as a Reading Renaissance Master School, and our 
dedicat
ion to supporting our at risk students. At Parker Whitney Elementary School, parents and 
staff together are dedicated to creating a safe and orderly learning environment in which students 
interact positively with others and are able to develop responsibili
ty, confidence, and self
-
esteem 
while achieving to their highest academic potential. Families play very important roles in Parker 
Whitney Elementary School through their active participation and involvement in School Site 
Council, and Parent Teacher Club (
PTC). They share information with classes about professional 
lives, teach special skills (art, music, and sports), work on school or playground improvements, 
conduct fund
-
raisers and make donations. They regularly volunteer their services in the classrooms
 
and the library. Parker Whitney Elementary School has become a focal point and center for students 
and the community.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
The mission of Parker Whitney Elementary, a California Distinguished school and a key component 
of a diverse learning community, is to ensure each student will experience meaningful and 
measurable academic growth and build a strong, active connection to hi
s or her community as a 
dynamic life
-
long learner by:

expectations

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about
 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to
 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, se
e the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Parker Whitney School, the second school built in the Rocklin Unified School District, has served Kindergarten through 6th 
grade students for 45 years. 
Transitional Kindergarten is now offered at Parker Whitney.  Having undergone modernization, it now has a large cafeteria, la
rge Visual and Performing 
Arts (V.A.P.A) room, stage, and band room.
 
All volunteers are required to we
ar an I.D. badge and visitors are required to check in at the office to ensure the safety of our students. Supervision is 
provided before school, during recesses, and immediately after school.
 
Parker Whitney School has a comprehensive safety and crisis int
ervention plan including an Action Plan with a Crisis Plan component. Emergency drills 
including fire, lock

-
campus evacuation are practiced on a monthly basis to ensure a smooth and orderly process. District wide safety 
inspections are done on
 
an ongoing basis throughout the year.
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d

developed by the State of California Office of Pub
lic School Construction.  District maintenance ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient se
rvice and that emergency 
repai
rs are given the highest priority.

glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and

School Safety Plan
 
We envision a school community that promotes and sustains responsible citizenship achieved th
rough appropriate academic excellence and developing 
social skills. We understand that nurturing is a process that takes many forms, beginning with acceptance and understanding o
f diversity of age, race
-
ethnicity, and culture. We strive for an environment 
that is safe and we are committed to maintaining a responsible safety plan that includes policy and 
procedures. We believe that all students can learn at Parker Whitney School.
 
 
Safe School Plan:  All schools in the Rocklin Unified School District have a C
omprehensive School Safety Plan approved by the School Site Council. It 
includes an assessment of the current status of school crime, procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils, rules and pr
ocedures on school discipline, 
school
-
wide dress code, poli
cies regarding actions which would lead to suspension/expulsion, sexual harassment policy, procedures for the safe ingress 
and egress of pupils, and other safe school strategies and programs. It also includes an action plan for implementation of th
e plan. 
 
At Parker Whitney 
School, we are in the twelfth year of implementation of the plan. The 2019
-
20 school year plan will continue to focus on bully proofing, positive behavior 
intervention systems (PBIS), playground interaction, articulating, training, and i
mplementing emergency procedures. Parker Whitney has also dedicated 
time each day for social
-
emotional awareness education through our In Focus curriculum and other social awareness and development resources.
