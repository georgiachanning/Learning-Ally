Opportunities

(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Valhalla
 
has
 
an
 
extremely
 
active
 
Parent
 
Faculty
 
Association
 
(VPFA).
 
The
 
VPFA
 
holds
 
regular
 
monthly
 
board
 
meetings.
 
The
 
Executive
 
Board
 
has
 
representatives
 
from
 
the
 
faculty,
 
elected
 
parent
 
officers,
 
and
 
classroom
 
representatives
 
who
 
are
 
responsible
 
for
 
disseminating
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
monthly
 
meetings
 
to
 
all
 
families
 
in
 
their
 
student™s
 
classroom.
 
The
 
Parent
 
Club
 
provides
 
updates
 
on
 
school
 
events
 
by
 
use
 
of
 
a
 
schoolwide
 
communication
 
program
 
and
 
app
 
called
 
Konstella.
   
Konstella
 
is
 
an
 
electronic
 
format
 
that
 
contains
 
school-wide
 
information
 
all
 
in
 
one
 
place
 
that
 
allows
 
communication
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
directly
 
without
 
divulging
 
any
 
identifying
 
information
 
of
 
our
 
families
 
others
 
however
 
families
 
can
 
contact
 
one
 
another
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
teacher
 
through
 
the
 
app.
  
In
 
addition,
 
our
 
VPFA
 
has
 
also
 
created
 
grade
 
level
 
social
 
media
 
pages-
  
a
 
parent
 
Facebook
 
page
 
to
 
keep
 
everyone
 
up
 
to
 
date
 
and
 
informed
 
through
 
a
 
different
 
avenue.
 
 
The
 
VPFA
 
participates
 
in
 
the
 
Pleasant
 
Hill
 
Community
 
Service
 
Day
 
activities
 
in
 
September,
 
where
 
parents,
 
grandparents,
 
community
 
businesses,
 
neighbors,
 
and
 
students
 
participate
 
in
 
campus
 
improvements.
 
We
 
have
 
now
 
also
 
added
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
years
 
our
 
Edible
 
Garden
 
that
 
is
 
supported
 
by
 
parent

This
 
year
 
we
 
have
 
included
 
a
 
Family
 
STEAM
 
Family

as
 
well
 
as
 
a

One
 
of
 
the
