About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parent Participation
 
Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encourage parents to become actively 
involved in our school 
by inviting
 
parents to volunteer in classrooms, participate in ELAC, GATE, and other after
-
school programs. We have Parent Information Nights to keep 
parents informed about assessment, curriculum and instruction and we provide parents with ways in which they can beco
me partners with us in the 


Teacher Association (PTA) has approximately 100 members.  The PTA sponsors enrichment 
programs and provides materials for the benefit and welfare of our children and the commu
nity.
 
 
Five parents took an active part in school planning by serving as members of the School Site Council.  This included overseei
ng the budget, Safe School 
Plan and the School Site Plan. In addition, parents at Parkview are provided the opportunity to p
articipate in Literacy Training sessions in order to support 
their children at home with reading and writing.
 
 
Additionally, we have monthly Principal coffee chats where the principal seeks input from parents regarding concerns on campu
s.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides 
the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The goal of Parkview 
Elementary is to meet the academic, social and emotional needs of our students through a collaborative partnership with stude
nts, 
parents, staff and community. Students and staff must be equipped with the necessary training, tools and services in order to
 
assure a safe, secure 
learning environment. Teachers are provided with and trained on updated procedures and/or policies that affect school safety.
 
Uniform school rules and 
consistent discipline policies are established and posted throughout the school. Fi
re and disaster drills are conducted and staff is continually trained and 
updated regarding their responsibilities in case of an emergency. Adequate playground supervision is provided by classified s
upervisors and certificated 
staff. Parkview Safety Patrol
 
members and the School Resource Officer are posted at the front of the school to assist children crossing the street and 
vehicles entering the upper parking lot. Clear plans and supervision are established for students who ride the bus, walk or a
re droppe
d off by parents. 
Fencing was added to ensure a closed campus during the school day. In the event of an emergency, Parkview has a comprehensive
 
response plan in the 
Safe School Plan, which was updated and approved by School Site Council on September 11, 20
19.
 
 
The Parkview staff believes in high expectations for all students, both academically and socially.  Most teachers have receiv
ed CLAD (Cognitive Language 
Acquisition Development) certification, G.L.A.D training, and have been trained in English 
Language Development Instruction and use this training to 
ensure Limited English Proficient students benefit equally from classroom instruction. This year, teachers will continue to e
xpand their use of strategies 
to differentiate instruction based on data 
analysis.  We will also continue to deconstruct standards and provide rigorous instruction.  Instructional 
practices are monitored throughout the year. It is our belief that, when students feel successful about their education, they
 
tend to make better cho
ices 
about treating others in a respectful manner.  All staff is in
-
serviced annually on Blood Bourne Pathogens and sexual harassment and they receive written 
information regarding the definition of sexual harassment and procedures to be followed to regist
er a complaint. Additionally, all staff will receive 
professional development and training on their roles and responsibilities in the event of an emergency or disaster. Additiona
lly,  all visitors/volunteers 
to the school campus sign in at the office using
 
the new  Raptor System to ensure student safety and accountability for adults on campus in case of an 
emergency.
