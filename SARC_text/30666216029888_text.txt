Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents, staff and students work collaboratively as a team to make Palmyra Elementary School an outstanding 
environment  to learn, grow and develop new skills.  At the beginning of the school year, the principal meets with the staff 
to prioritize steps to 
meet the needs of the school and community. Parents enjoy many opportunities to provide leadership 
and input by their involvement in SSC, ELAC, and PTA.  An annual survey is conducted so all parents can evaluate and 
provide specific input on the programs a

training is provided, in English and Spanish, on a variety of topics determined by the Instructional Leadership Team (ILT), 
ELAC, and SSC.  Weekly School Messenger phone calls, r
egular posts on social media, Friday communication folders, and 
the OUSD Parent Portal (online grade book and attendance report) provide parents with regular communication from the 
school.
 
 
Parents support the  school through numerous activities such as vo
lunteering in the library and in the classroom, 
participating in PTA meetings and events, SSC, ELAC, and other school
-
related activities. Our PTA meets monthly to 
develop and plan activities that support teachers and students.  They fund study trips, Art M
asters, Red Ribbon Week 
activities, and teacher enrichment grants.  Adult participation in school programs is always positive and adds to the success
 
of all of our school programs.  The School Site Council, with input from ELAC, helps develop and implement
 
the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) and determines the SPSA budget.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and
 
if 
necessary, update their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
School and Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to 
the schools an
d maintains a file of individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
Student safety is of great importance to all staff members at Palmyra. The entire perimeter of our school is secured with 
chain link fencing. During the school day, all 
gates are locked so that the only access to the school is through the front 
office. All parents and visitors sign in at the front desk and identification is checked when parents, or other adults, come 
to pick up students. Before school supervision is two
-
f
old. As students enter the campus, a credentialed teacher is on duty 
at the main gate to greet students. Students proceed to the breakfast/lunch area, after entering the school, where two 
supervisors are present. During recesses, two certificated staff mem
bers are on duty. We employ four noon duty 
supervisors at lunch. As students leave school, credentialed teachers and the principal patrol all forms of egress.  Our 
school is a very safe and positive place for children. In compliance with SB187, the safety 
committee has prepared a Safe 
School Action Plan that is (on file) in the school office and is available for perusal upon request. Our Safe School Action 
Plan was updated and reviewed in February 2019. A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire an
d/or earthquake 
drills are conducted monthly. All schools in the district are linked through an emergency radio contact system, and district 
radio drills are held periodically, to ensure preparedness in case of a disaster.

Palmyra teachers participate in regular professional development opportunities that foster a collaborative and innovative 
culture.  The staff is focused on providing 21st Century 
learning opportunities within their classrooms for their students.   
The Wednesday modified day schedule is used effectively to support teacher collaboration within Professional Learning 
Communities and to provide Professional Development.  The focus of PL
C meetings and Professional Development 
opportunities are developed collaboratively by the Instructional Leadership Team with input from all teachers.  Data from 
a variety of assessments is regularly reviewed and analyzed to provide student interventions a
nd professional 
development for teachers (SBAC, Interim Assessments, Dibels, Envision Math assessments, ELPAC, etc).  Our professional 
development plan (as reflected in our SPSA) includes teachers receiving training, observing lessons of other teachers, an
d 
fostering  in
-
house experts.  Palmyra teachers have received training with a focus on the Common Core State Standards, 
ELA/Math curriculum resources, AVID, Write from the Beginning and Beyond, data analysis, GLAD strategies, ELD, and 
technology implement
ation in the classroom. Our GATE and Special Education teachers have also participated in additional 
training specific to their area of expertise.  For the last four years, Palmyra teachers have participated in the "Summer 
College for Kids" in collaboratio
n with the California State University, Fullerton's Department of Reading and Literacy 
Education.  This summer program is a practical, hands
-
on learning opportunity for students and teachers.  Teachers attend 
training to learn literacy development strategi
es and then teach alongside University experts to gain valuable knowledge 
and feedback. The District's Curriculum, Special Programs, and Technology departments also provide a variety of training 
opportunities for teachers and administrators.
