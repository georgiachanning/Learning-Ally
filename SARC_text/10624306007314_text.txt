By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Roosevelt Elementary School is a K
-
6 elementary school rich in both history and tradition. Roosevelt is located in the center 
of the city of Selma in Fresno County and is mainly an urban family setting. Theodore Roosevelt School was
 
first built in 
1921 to house 7th and 8th grade students. The thirty year old main school building was demolished due to an earthquake 
in 1952 and rebuilt in 1955. In 1993, the middle school was moved to a newly constructed facility at another site and 
Roo
sevelt became a K
-
6th grade elementary school. Most of our parents who have lived in Selma attended Roosevelt as 
a junior high school, which has created a family atmosphere, a sense of pride, and ownership within the whole community.
 
 
Roosevelt enrollment 
is 690 students, kindergarten thru 6th grade. The children of our school are of a culturally diverse 
background with approximately 9.90% being of minority race. Hispanic students comprise 90.10% of the total student 
population, while Asians represent 3.35%
. All other minority races are less than 1%. The income of our families can be 
characterized as low to middle income. 100% of our students receive free meals due to a grant. Of the 90% that are of the 
minority race, 31% are enrolled in the English Language
 
Learners Program. Roosevelt Elementary School has 216 EL 
students.
 
 
Our mission at Roosevelt Elementary School is to empower students to develop a desire to learn and be resilient in the 
face of challenges. We will develop intellectual curiosity and a pas
sion for high achievement through rigorous and diverse 
curriculum while embracing individual differences. We commit to work collaboratively with parents and the school 
community to ensure student learning.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e.,

Selma Unified School District supports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through a Site Based Coaching 
model.  This model allows for job embedded Professional learning by implementing the tenets of the Professional Learning 
Community framewor
k. The district maintains a ELA/ELD, Math and Science coaching team that in turn support and 
provide instructional support for our site level coaching team. In collaboration with both teams, professional learning for 
teachers is provided to assist all stud
ents in achieving the State academic standards, with an emphasis on addressing and 
supporting student groups requiring additional resources; groups such as Foster Youth, English Learners, and 
Students 
with Disabilities.
 
 
The District also provides all teac
hers with three professional learning days throughout the year.  These are non

allowing teachers time for instructional plann
ing as they apply to the California Standards for the Teacher Profession 
(CSTPs 3, 4, & 5).
