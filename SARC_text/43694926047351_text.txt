Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Lakeside's Message 
 
Lakeside Elementary School and the 
Lakeside Joint School District, founded in 1881, serves nearly 1,500 mountain 
residents in a rural area southwest of the town of Los Gatos, CA. The District offers the best of all possible environments. 
The rural character and beautiful surroundings provid
e a tranquil setting of forest, lakes, and open space. However, the 
District is less than 10 minutes away from the thriving community and resources of Los Gatos, approximately 20 miles 

activities ranging from performing arts (opera, 
symphony, theater) to equestrian adventures and mountain biking. Artists, musicians, farmers, vintners, and Silicon Valley 

st, vineyards, tree farms, and some 
commercial forest land. Many residents commute to their workplace in the greater Silicon Valley area. 
 
 
This single school district is a major center
-
point of the community. Parents and community members take pride in 
La

broad socioeconomic range in the area is reflected in a richly diverse student population. They all feel a strong kinship 
with this school
 
and provide extraordinarily strong support. 
 
 
Attention to the Common Core Standards is stressed at all grade levels along with Project Based Learning strategies. In 
addition, there is a solid emphasis on physical education, music education, and science e

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District gives daily attention to the site and facility conditions in order to ensure that Lakeside School is clean,
 
safe, 
functional, and a healthy place for students and staff. To assist in this effort, in Spring 2006, the District conducted an 
overall assessment using the facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construc
tion. In February 2015, the District completed its annual Insurance Renewal Questionnaire. This questionnaire 
contains information about the age and square footage of buildings. The summary stated that Lakeside school buildings 
and grounds are adequately m
aintained, with clean, well
-
maintained walking surfaces and no trip or fall hazards noted.
 
 
The results of the aforementioned survey and questionnaire are available at the school/district office.
 
 
Lead was detected during a routine water test in August 
2015. We continue to monitor the water quality on a monthly 
basis, overseen by the California State Water Resources Control Board. Letters are sent to every family and staff member 
regarding results of annual testing. For more information, contact the Cali
fornia State Water Resources Control Board at 
(510) 620
-
3474 or the Santa Clara County Health Department of Environmental Health at (408) 918
-
3400 who can provide 
you with information about the health effects of lead.

Age of School Buildings
 
Lakeside Elementary School
 
has six classrooms, a science room, an art/music room, a library, a staff/conference room, a 
school/district administration office, and a community center/multi

purpose building. The main campus was established 
in 1910. A wood
-
frame addition was added in 
1958. A modular classroom building was added in 1965, and the building 
that now exists as the district/school office and classrooms was built in 1967. Additional modular classrooms were added 
in 1984 and 1996. The Lakeside Community Center and multi
-
purpos
e building was constructed in 2003. This new multi
-
purpose building (Community Center) is 4,660 square feet and is reserved for exclusive use of the school during the school 
day. The Community Center contains a small snack kitchen and two gender
-
designated
 
bathrooms. The ladies/girls' 
bathroom has four toilets and two sinks. The men/boys' bathroom has three toilets, one urinal, and two sinks. The 
Community Center is also a designated Red Cross Disaster Shelter. The District field has a track and field appro

size for elementary students, which was renovated in 2004 and the track was refurbished in July 2013. A new air 
conditioning system was added in Summer 2016.
 
 

four serve as:
 
 

 
Music/Science Room where students and teachers meet for twice
-
weekly small group sessions of music 
instruction and small group lab tables for hands

The facilities management is undertaken by the Superintendent/Principal.
 

 
The District has several storage structures. These are dedicated to the kiln and its operation, supplemental 
teaching materials, currently unused furniture, garden tools
, etc. These structures are located away from the main 
classrooms, but within easy access of personnel.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summati
ve Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partic
ipate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of student
s who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
