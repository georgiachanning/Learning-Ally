By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
 

 
The middle grades are a time of great c
hange from childhood to adolescence. It is a time when students need to feel 
supported by and connected to adults and to their school. As a result, Rolling Hills Middle School is focused on ensuring a 
rigorous academic experience while also developing the 
whole child.
 
 
Teachers at Rolling Hills are committed to the team or academy model of teaching in which a team of four core academic 
teachers (in 7th and 8th grades; 2 teachers in 6th) across various disciplines work together to establish ties with student
s 

social needs. We hold parent conferences as a team, instead of individual teacher conferences, so that we can better meet 
student needs and 
increase communication about student progress. We continue to work on improving the middle grades 
program based on data from our student and parent surveys. 
 
 
We are proud to have a safe campus environment where students are encouraged to learn and to achi
eve academically. 
Parents and students are consistently pleased with our programs and are proud to be a Rolling Hills Bengal.
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
The Rolling Hills Middle School Community is focused on academic rigor, personal responsibility, and mut
ual respect to 
develop the whole child as a contributing and informed citizen.
 
 
School Vision Statement
 
TLC: Think, Learn, Collaborate
 
 
School Profile

At Rolling Hills we believe in educating the whole child to become a lifelong learner, a person who will make a differen
ce 

programs. We follow research such as Taking Center Stage Act II, analyze ongoing assessments, and constantly review the 

s goals for improving student performance. Combined with staff input, we determine necessary supports and work 
to find a way to implement those supports within the school day. We have developed and implemented numerous 
strategies and programs, such as:
 

 
s
up
port for all levels of student abilities are supported from not yet proficient to gifted and talented students. 
For high achievers, we offer Algebra, Geometry, and Spanish
 

 
a variety of specialized academic instruction (SAI) classes, and services through ou
r County in speech, 
occupational therapy, and adaptive physical education (APE) when necessary
 

 
reading support (Read 180) which meets the needs of students who are 2+ years below grade level in reading 
and also supports EL learners
 

 
Accelerated Reader progr
am 4 out of 5 days per week.
 

 
our Intervention program, which works with students who need a little more support
 

 
an interdisciplinary team, or academy, approach to teaching middle school students.
 
While we are not an ethnically diverse community, we do not 
ignore the importance of diversity for our staff and students. 
Due to our supporting data of students involved in harassment issues and teasing, one of the goals of our site is to develop 
sensitivity to differences. To do so, we focus on refusal skills and
 
sensitivity to differences. We have adopted aspects of 

our counselor and Leadership teacher, will reach out to students on campus to help 
everyone feel accepted. We continue 
to have assemblies focused on anti
-
bullying and awareness, and Leadership students are trained as leaders on campus to 
take a stand against bullying.
 
 

s to students and others. There are ramps to all classrooms, 
one large stall in each restroom, and sidewalks to all areas. Our campus is situated over a hillside so our architects were 
especially aware of a design that allowed access to all. In our classro
oms there are computer counters, sinks, and towel 
dispensers specially designed for wheelchair access. We have handicapped parking spaces and a special small electric cart 
that can transport students or others who may need assistance. 
 
 
We are a community 
of teachers and learners and there is a spirit of camaraderie. We at Rolling Hills benefit from total 
community pride in our students, staff, and our school as we all support the value of graduating children who are lifelong 
learners and who look to make a
 
difference.
 
 
Technological skills valued in the workplace are addressed through our Technology Plan. Grants, one
-
time monies, parent 
donations, and an Intel partnership provide every teacher with at least one computer for teacher use in their classroom 
as
 
well as a 1:1 classroom ratio of chromebook carts for language arts, history, and science classrooms, and a 2:1 
chromebook cart ratio in math classes. We have interactive Promethean boards installed in every classroom. Grades are 
accessible to parents and
 
teachers on
-
line. We also have wireless accessibility throughout the whole campus. We have 
updated our technology to allow students to broadcast a weekly news bulletin using green screen technology. The 
broadcast is shown in all of the classes on Mondays.
 
 
 
Our team approach to this delicate time of brain development allows a campus of over 1000 students to feel like a small 
community in which students can thrive academically and emotionally. We are proud to be Bengals.

which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and

Rolling Hills Middle School realizes the positive correlation between parent involvement and successful students. For this 
reason, the school continually searches for avenues to involve parents and the community to participate in the education 
of our stude
nts. The school greatly benefits from its supportive parents who volunteer in the classroom, work as coaches, 
and participate on the School Site Council and Friends of Rolling Hills. The school also benefits from several community 
partnerships, including w
orking with the county library, EDH Community Services District, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and 
Oak Ridge High School.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is always in compliance with 
all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Fire, intruder, 
evacuat
ion, and disaster drills are held regularly throughout the year. Our Emergency Operations Plan lays out structured 
levels of potential responses to any sort of emergency, and follows the nationally
-
recognized Incident Command System 
(ICS).  The Emergency O
perations Plan was reviewed by the School Safety Committee and Site Council at the September 
2018 Site Council meeting. This sort of expansive emergency response system offers a high level of security for students, 
staff, and volunteers.
 
 
The School Site S
afety Plan was last reviewed and updated in September 2019 by the School Safety Committee and Site 
Council.  Besides the more obvious elements of physical safety regarding emergencies (discussed in the paragraph above), 
the school is also proactive in crea
ting a safe and comfortable learning environment for all students and staff.  We engage 
in monthly campus
-
wide character education assemblies, exercises, activities, and/or lessons; we carefully assess annual 
school culture and climate surveys; we foster a
 
very active student council group; and we offer SEL and academic support 
for all students.
