About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school 
in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educa
tional agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally
, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cd
e.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
commun
ity members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration b
uilding. We have several portable class rooms to accommodate 
increased enrollment. The custodial team does a great job at keeping the grounds clean and well manicured. Classrooms, buildi
ngs and restrooms are 
cleaned daily.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensur
es that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance
 
program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
S
tockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California Stat
e University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

king the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total numb
er of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, eithe
r because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, th
e number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

ures the school facilities 
are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning pr
ocess occurs during a close of school, either during 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and 
district personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the 
students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the districts 
Readiness and Emergency Management Plan (REMS) occurs at the beginning of each year.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan is revised at the beginning o
f each school year. The plan helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean environment 

cies and natural 
disasters. Ongoing teacher 
training takes place on site for several different disastrous scenarios. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. A Campus Safety Assistant, y
ard su
pervisors, teachers, 
site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for al
l students. All visitors must 
sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must
 
display their passes at all times.
