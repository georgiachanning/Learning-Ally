School Description
 
The mission of the Bishop Union Elementary Community Day School is to provide a safe and 
supportive atmosphere where staff, students, family and community members work together to 
create a learning environment where all participants develop a desire for pe
rsonal growth and life
-
long learning.
 
 
Bishop is located in Inyo County along Highway 395, at the gateway to the Inyo National Forest, 
with a population of nearly 4,000. Bishop Unified School District strives to provide a quality 
education for all its stud
ents, with a wide range of programs and a talented staff dedicated to the 
needs of its population. The District serves approximately 2,000 students in grades K
-
12.
 
 
Students served at the CDS are those who qualify and who are not experiencing success in a 
regular 
school setting. It is hoped that placement in a setting with a small student
-
teacher ratio, more 
individualized instruction and closer guidance/monitoring will help the student achieve a more 
positive outcome both in school and in their lives. Stud
ents may be probation referred, SARBed, 
oppositional/defiant, expelled, academically unsuccessful, credit deficit, pregnant or parenting.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SAR
C). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LC
AP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF
 
web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Bishop Unified School District sets a high priority upon en

instructional program. Bishop Unified School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019 and determined that each sc
hool within the District 
has suffi
cient and good quality textbooks or instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, 
including English learners, are provided their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks in core subjects for us
e in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
All textbooks and instructional materials used within the District are aligned with the California State Content Standards an
d Frameworks and have been 

-
based mate

-
year 
adoption cycle for core content materials.
 
 
The textbook adoption process begins with the formation of an Adoption Committee consisting of administrators and teachers. 
The committee identifies 
key elements to consider in the adoption decision
-
making process and establishes selection criteria based on State and District standards. The committee 
reviews instructional materials on the State list and invites publishers to pr
ovide an overview of their respective materials. The committee examines each 
program and selects programs to be piloted. Recommended programs are available for 30 days prior to adoption at the school li
brary and District office 
for teachers and parents to 
review. The feedback provided by teachers and parents becomes the basis for the recommendations to the Board of Trustees 
for final adoption.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and
 
conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order ar
e completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenan
ce staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order
.
 
 
CLEANING PROCESS AND SCHEDULE
 
The District has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is available at the
 
school office or at the District 
office. The site administration team works daily with the custod
ial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides State matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Bishop Union Elementary Community Day School. The school is in complianc
e with all laws, rules, and 

paredness plan includes steps for ensuring 
student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis. Teachers and noon aide
s monitor school grounds, 
including the cafeteria and playground, before, during, and af
ter school to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The school is a closed campus; all 

chool.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan was d
eveloped by the school in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. 
The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensi
ve Safety Plan i
nclude 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedure
s for safe ingress and 
egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and dress code guidelines. The District collaborated 
with the Bishop Police Department to update the 
plans at all the schools. This process created a comprehensive crisis management plan for all schools in the community. The p
lan was completed and 
reviewed with school staff in August 2012. A copy of the plan
 
is available to the public at the school and District offices.

Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed State proficiency levels. 
Professional development within the 
District addresses the individual needs of teachers as well as broader school concerns. Five mandatory staff development days
 
are available annually. 
The District analyzes test scores and conducts a teacher survey to det
