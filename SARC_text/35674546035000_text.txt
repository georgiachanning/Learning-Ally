Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The single school building is in good condition.  In 2008, several large shade trees were removed and new trees have been 
planted to replace them.  New picnic tables were also purchas
ed in 2008, 2014, and 2015.  Window screens have been 
installed to classroom and office windows in 2012.  During the summer of 2016, a new fence was installed to replace the 
damage from truck drivers making U
-
turns in front of the school; thee trees were r
emoved due to potential safety hazards; 
inside of the school building was painted; and new blinds were installed.  The school had the duct
-
work examined and 
cleaned in Winter of 2009.  The school is cleaned daily, trash emptied, and grounds swept by custod
ial staff.  Restrooms 
are cleaned and sanitized daily.  Carpets are deep cleaned 1
-
2 times per year.  Outside grounds maintenance is performed 
by staff and independent contractors to keep the grounds free of leaves and weeds.
 
 
The school has a school bus in
 
order to carry more students.  This is in anticipation of needing to seek more inter
-
district 
transfers to fill the openings created by the number of declining local in
-
district students.  Please contact the Principal for 
more information.

Tully School receives state and federal funding.  The increase in funds for 
the LCAP year will be calculated based upon the needs of the enrolled 
students.  These funds will be used to improve the 
education and success rate of the low income, foster youth, and English Learners as the needs arise in our school.  As a 
small necessary school, our enrollment tends to fluctuate and so do the numbers of t
he low income, foster youth, and 
English Learners.  With a small enrollment of low income, foster youth, and English Learners, a small class size is beneficia
