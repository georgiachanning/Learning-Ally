About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condit
ion and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annua
l school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Calif
ornia 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional fa

textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Stan

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At Will Rogers Elementary School there are four main building areas: the two story building structure, the Pod classrooms, th
e bungalows, and the 
administration building. In a walkthrough of our facilities, you will find the new two story building containi
ng twenty four classrooms; within this building, 
every four classrooms you will also find a commonly shared work room. In addition, our Pod classrooms were completely renovat
ed the summer of 2008. 
The new Pod accommodates 14 classrooms, one large teacher w
orkroom, and two
 
resource rooms. All first grade students are housed in the Pod. The administration building is also a new building. Its const
ruction took place at the same 
time as the new two story building. Furthermore, all classrooms are fully equipped 
with internet access and new computers. Our digital marquee allows 
our communication with the public, parents, and community has doubled with the use of the marquee.
 
 
Additional repairs and or replacement of roofing systems and paved areas were completed i
n  fiscal years 2014
-
2015 and 2015
-
2016. Additional 
improvements are being scheduled for the remaining fiscal year of 105
-
2016 and the new upcoming fiscal year of 2016
-
2017 that will include play field 
irrigation upgrades and rubber matting at kinder play 
area.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their stru
ctural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies
 
it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

ach school year parents spearhead student events and activities such as fairs, fund raisers, field trips, luncheons, decorati
ons, and much more. Parents 
at Will Rogers also have the opportunity to provide leadership and governance to the school as members 
of the School Site Council, English Language 
Advisory Committee and the School Advisory Council. These groups of parents meet monthly with administration and staff to wor
k toward completion 
of the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement. Moreover, parents are 
important to the success of Will Rogers Elementary. Parents attend conferences with 

suing high levels of 
academic achievement at Wi
ll Rogers.  We also constantly provided parents learning opportunities, such as Family Math Night, Latino Family Literacy 
Project along with other opportunities.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Will Rogers Elementary. Administrators, teachers and staff,
 
security, custodial staff, and campus 
monitors regularly monitor the campus; they never loose sight of the safety and welfare of our student population. Students a
re supervised at all times. 
Campus monitors oversee the safety of students before school, at
 
recess, and during lunch. At dismissal time, teachers escort their classes to designated 
pick
-
up gates. Kindergartners are released only to their parents or caregivers. We also have a campus monitor provide 30 minutes o
f after school 
supervision to ensure
 
parents have enough time to get to campus.  We are a closed campus to ensure our students' safety, however we welcome parents
 
and community members to visit the campus. Anyone wishing to be on school grounds during operating hours must notify the staf
f ah
ead of time and 
must check in the Main Office upon arrival. All visitors must sign in at the Main Office and wear identification badges throu
ghout the duration of their 
visit. District security officers patrol the campus and surrounding area to ensure the 
safety of students, staff, and facilities.
 
 
The school safety plan is revised every spring by the School Site Council.  In January the revisions are shared immediately w
ith all members of the staff. 
Staff is provided ongoing training and information relate
d to school safety.  The key elements outlined within the plan include: 1) child abuse reporting 
procedures; 2) teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures; 3) disaster response procedures; 4) procedures for safe e
ntrance and exit from 
school; 5) s
exual harassment policy: 6) suspension and expulsion policies; 7) dress code; 8) discipline policies. Furthermore, the school
 
is in compliance 
with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The schoo

steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a foreseen and unforeseen disaster. Moreover, to prepare for the unknown, 
fire, disaster, lockdown, 
and intruder drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout t
he school year.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Teachers continue to attend the district Summer Institute which provides grade level or topic specific professional developme
nt. Many different teaching 
strategies are are included during this time that reinforce the following strategies: Small Group Instr
uction, Effective Centers, Golden Ticket lesson model, 
Designated and Integrated ELD, SWUN Math and Common Core. Evidence of these strategies was observed by the administration dur
ing classroom 
walkthroughs throughout the academic school year. In addition,
 
the Instructional Lead provided opportunities during the school day for teaching 
strategies and support based on data during reflections, administrations recommendations, or teachers request. Each grade lev
el also participate in 
multiple Guided Planning S
essions during the school day for lesson planning to ensure students knowledge of the standards. 
 
 
At the school site, all teachers are trained on administering the current state assessment to measure English Proficiency for
 
English Learners (ELPAC). All 
t
eachers were also trained on the EL Master Plan, in which the identification, placement, instruction, and reclassification pr
ocesses were reviewed. 
 
 
Teacher are trained in Google Apps and as a result have received Chromebooks specifically for the students
 
in the classroom. Some teachers attend 
Digital Educator Institutes to best implement technology in their classroom. Additionally all teachers have been trained in G
oogle Classroom and use it 
both to communicate and work with their students but also a reso
urce for themselves to share lessons and work together collaboratively. As teachers 
receive individual training they become the experts and are expected to train and support their grade level peers.
 
 
Teachers and the administration have received ongoing tr
aining on Thinking Maps. When we attend training of trainer workshops, teachers return to 
Will Rogers and share their learning with their fellow grade level team members.
 
 
Additionally we have begun the implementation of SWUN Math in grades 4
-
6. Teachers a
re breaking their math instruction down to better support the 
needs of all students.
