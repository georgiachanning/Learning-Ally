Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Vision for Rose Ferrero Elementary School: A School of Excellence 
-
 
We will provide a safe & secure, non
-
threatening 
learning environment where all students can and will achieve academic success and develop into ci
tizens who contribute 
positively to our global community.
 
 
Rose Ferrero Elementary School will achieve this vision by:
 

 
implementing Common Core State Standards with a focus on the Key Ideas in English Language Arts and Math;
 

 
following the PLC "Cycle of 
Learning": 1) teachers select their grade
-
level "Essential Standards", 2) create a "Unit 
of study" by breaking apart each essential standard down to the skills and concepts students must know, 3) 
determine what proficiency looks like for each skill/concept
, 4) determine the level of rigor and DOK levels to be 
addressed during instruction and assessment, 5) determine the instructional strategies and resources to be used 
that will best ensure students will learn, 6) Create two Common Formative Assessments (CF
A) [ver. A & B] for 
easch essential skill/concept within the standard and an "end of study" or Unit test, 7) determine the timeline, or 
schedule for instruction, assessment, intervention, and reassessment, 8) Teach [Tier 1 "prevention"], 9) administer 
CFA 
[ver. A], 10) analyze the data [per data protocol], 11) determine plans for Tier 2 Interventions, reassessment 
[CFA, ver. B], and Extension, 12) Review all Unit skills/concepts, 13) administer the Unit assessment, 14) analyze 
the data [per data protocol] a
nd respond as needed ..... [repeat this cycle for each essential standard]
 

 
focus on Systematic Quality Instruction, which includes: promoting the Growth Mindset in all classrooms; use of 
the Gradual Release of Responsibility in all lessons; implementing cl
ose
-
reading strategies; creating rigorous 
assignments and supporting students while at the same time, holding them accountable to respond proficiently; 
promote reading (for pleasure) on a daily basis; the daily implementation of Number Talks ...
 

 
further as
sess students using benchmark assessments (NWEA/MAP K
-
2, as well as the CAASPP Interims [IABs & 
CATs]) to determine progress on CCSS;
 

 
using Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) to provide a safe, nurturing, creative and inspiring 
learning en
vironment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Ach
ievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alt
ernate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the 
requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Rose Ferrero staff members are provided with a variety of professional development opportunities. The staff development 
plan is created with the input of staff, the School Site Council, and is based on the needs of our staff as determined by on
-
going data 
analysis. Staff development occurs on 6 full training days, on early release Wednesdays, and at Tuesday Staff 
Meetings. Rose Ferrero is following the Professional Learning Communities model of collaboration. Each group focuses on 
student learning in genera
l and specifically during their daily 40 minute intervention time. Working together, the faculty 
answers the questions: What do we want students to learn? How do we know when they have learned it? What do we do 
when students don't learn? What do we do when
 
students have already learned it? Each new teacher receives assistance 
and support from a mentor teacher who has been trained through the BTSA Program.
