By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The OMSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools. Elderberry Elementary proudly exceeds the 
adopted standards by ensuring and maintaining a clean and safe ca
mpus. All facilities are in good working order. OMSD 
Operations, site administration, and custodial staff collaborate to develop cleaning schedules and procedures that 
guarantee all classrooms, offices, and restrooms are cleaned daily. In addition, the Hea
d Custodian regularly checks 
restrooms throughout the school day. Staff and students work together to maintain a clean and orderly school.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. The custodial staff and 
District 
Operations Department make certain that all necessary upkeep and repairs are attended to on a regular basis or in a 
timely manner when needed. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the 
highest priori
ty.The Operations Department conducts an in
-
depth annual evaluation of each school to determine the 
condition of the facilities and identify maintenance needs. The district uses a facility survey, developed by the State of 
California Office of Public Schoo
l Construction, to gather the information. Upon completion of the survey, the information 
is shared with the administration and work orders are submitted. The results of this survey are available at the school or 
district office. OMSD participates in the s

funds in order to assist schools with the expenditures for major repairs and upgrades. Typically, this includes the following
: 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrica
l systems, interior or exterior painting, floor, and carpeting. Each year 
the district matches the required allotment set by the state in order to participate in the deferred maintenance program.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

reviewed and received an updated copy of the safety plan in the school handbook. The plan outlines active shooter, 
emergency attendance fo
rms, emergency response team members, fire, and earthquake drill procedures. This year, staff, 
students, and parents will receive an updated, district
-
wide active shooter training. Monthly drills offer staff and students 
the opportunity to practice and bec
ome comfortable with procedures in the event of an emergency. In addition, the 
emergency procedures are reviewed during the year so the staff and students are prepared and understand their roles 
during a disaster. Practice and review of our emergency proce
dures enable our efficient and immediate response during 
monthly scheduled and unscheduled drills. Parents are informed of drills and procedures practiced by staff and students 
at parent meetings during the school year.
