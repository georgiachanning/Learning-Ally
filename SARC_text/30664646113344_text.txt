By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Vision: Inspire ALL students to positively contribute to society
 
and be prepared for the challenges of a diverse and 
dynamic world.
 
 
Located in the Capistrano Unified School District, Oak Grove Elementary School opened its doors in September 1996 with 
much fanfare and continues to be exceptional.  High academic and beh
avioral standards for students and staff, and 
tremendous parent and involvement, combined with a clear mission of teaching to the whole child are hallmarks of Oak 

 
is a team of students, 
staff, and community. Recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2000,  2004 and 2012, all team members continue 
to learn and grow together.
 
 
Setting high standards and expectations for all is one of the foundational philoso
phies at Oak Grove.  The acquisition of 
basic skills, fundamentals, and creating a solid academic base is essential for success at every academic level and in life. 
 
Staff members have a clear understanding that it is essential to prepare students to becom
e life
-
long learners in an 
economy that is rapidly changing and for careers and industries that might have yet to be imagined. Using data generated 
from both formal and informal assessments allows teachers to strategically pinpoint areas of strength and ar
eas that need 
more focus, design and plan effective lessons, and identify students that may need additional intervention or enrichment. 

 
closely with our English Learner Development (ELD) Instructional Assistant, ELD Advisor, staff, and parents for EL students 

with special
 
needs easily participate in general education classes and programs; the special education staff meets weekly 
to discuss student services, upcoming issues, and collaborate with general education staff.  These weekly meetings allow 
for immediate adjustments
 
and flexibility to ensure student success.
 
 
Recognizing that learning is a life
-
long process, staff members regularly participate in professional development during 
Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence (ACE time) and during district sponsored pro
fessional development.  
Teachers have received training on differentiated instructional strategies, Cognitive Autism Training (CAT), Guided 
Language Acquisition Development (GLAD), SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observational Protocol), Illuminate (data 
progr
am), Cognitively Guideed Instruction (math) and effective use of benchmark assessments to improve student 
achievement.
 
 
Oak Grove develops and reinforces high standards of behavior through a systematic approach.  Expectations for school 
behavior are clear 
and are rooted in Character Counts! and Bucket Filling (based on the book Have you Filled a Bucket 
Today?  By Carol McCloud).  All students are expected to have all
-
STAR behavior (Show pride, Take responsibility, Act in 
control, and be Respectful). Individ
ual classes use grade level appropriate activities that reinforce positive character traits 

conflicts begins in kindergarten and students i
n all grades are taught the Second Step curriculum by our school counselor.  
During the week, students that exhibit positive behavior or growth are selected to lead the Pledge of Allegiance over the 
PA system; victories both big and small are celebrated an
d reinforced.  Reciting the pledge as a school also demonstrates 
a school
-
wide commitment to good citizenship.  On Fridays, the entire school community gathers for the morning 
assembly and students are publically recognized for their accomplishments.

Rese
arch shows that parent involvement has a significant impact on student achievement and all members of the Oak 
Grove staff encourage and nurture this important partnership.  Parent volunteers, family members, and Oak Grove Alumni 
are evident everywhere on c

pods working on projects for teachers or working with groups of students.  Last year, Oak Grove volunteers logged over 


instructional programs.  The PTA raises funds for music instruction for students in kindergarten through third grade (CUSD 
only funds music for grades 4
-
5), classroom technologies, Art Ma
sters, United Streaming and The Frieda Belinfante Class 
Act Music Program.  They support and schedule assemblies such as the Imagination Machine.   A separate organization, 

 
trips. technology purchases, and 
staff development.  Classes offered through Adult
-
Community Education (for students of all ages) are well
-
attended by 
the Oak Grove community, and wraparound services such as the Family Resource Center (which offers parent
ing and social 
skills classes) are located on campus.
 
 
Oak Grove staff prides itself on providing the best academic program possible but one that also teaches to the individual 
needs of the whole child.  Student leadership skills are developed through stud
ent council and  peer tutoring. . Recognizing 

the Kids Run OC Marathon Program.  Parents and other community members work closely with s
taff to provide service 
learning experiences:  Jump Rope for Heart, and School Beautification.   Learning experiences that have a positive impact 
on student achievement also include the kinder
-
garden which provides a hands
-
on approach to math and science i
n a real 
life setting as well as the monthly fifth grade business fair.  This entrepreneurial role
-
playing allows students to understand 
first
-
hand how a business works as each student creates a business plan, advertises, and prepares to sell their product
.
 
 
By  working as a team with the community, teaching to the whole child, and embracing the belief that ALL students can 
learn, grow and soar, the staff and community truly implements the Oak Grove Mission statement:  Educating ALL children 
in safe 
environment so they reach their full potential.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on 
the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly
 
Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School Dis
trict to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Pro
tocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that 
supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing
 
professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of
 
quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is kn
own as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning
 
based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from mult
iple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teache
r teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Pro
fessional Learning 

Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Struc
tures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive s
ystematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with supp
ort from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may rec
eive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
