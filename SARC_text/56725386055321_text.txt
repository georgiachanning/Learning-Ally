About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The involvement of parents and community members is an essential component of nurturing students.  Every effort to invite and
 
consider parent and 
community input is made to ensure the success of our students.  A team 
of parents, teachers and administrators developed the following 
school/parent/community involvement policy. We involve and inform them in a variety of ways.There are several parent meetings
, such as School Site 
Council, English Learner Advisory Council, Ti
tle 1 Meetings, and "Coffee with the Principal", during which parents receive information and have input into 
critical decisions.  Our website is constantly updated with information that provides parents a connection to events and acti
vities on the school 
campus. 
School newsletters and calendars are sent home and posted on the website on a monthly basis.  Teachers regularly inform paren
ts of student progress 
through phone calls, conferences, progress reports, and behavior charts (if necessary).  Parent work
shops will be presented on a variety of topics, 
including: parenting skills, technology, curricular materials and assessment. This helps parents work with their students and
 
develop positive relationships 
at home, which, in turn, supports success at school
. We hold transitional meetings and workshops in order to assist parents whose children may be 
transitioning into Kindergarten or to the middle schools or to high school. Our Outreach Consultant and School Counselor offe
r support by connecting 
families wit
h necessary services to address social emotional needs. Additionally, Chavez School conducts an open forum for parents and co
mmunity 
members to further involve parents in the joint development and joint agreement of its School Parental Involvement Policy. 
The school has forged 
partnerships with local businesses and colleges throughout the community in order to bring additional resources into the scho
ol and for our families.
 
 
With the strong support of PTA, Chavez will provide several activities to increase 
parent involvement and reward students for meeting their academic 
achievement goals during the 2018
-
19 school year.  Family nights focusing on Literacy, Math, and Science will engage parents and families in academic 
activities to raise awareness and unders
tanding of the expectations set by the Common Core State Standards.  Additionally, events such as the 
Accelerated Reader Award Night, as well as the monthly Eagles Awards Assemblies, have been calendared to provide students wit
h academic incentives 
to meet
 
their learning goals.  Throughout the year, parents will also be invited to attend Parent/Teacher Conferences to collaborate 
with their child and 
their child's teacher to review achievement data and identify strategies for improving student success.  Pare
nts are provided with a description and 
explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and th
e proficiency levels 
students are expected to meet will be provided.  Some parents will als
o be asked to attend Student Success Team meetings if their child has been 
identified as performing significantly below grade
-
level standards or is exhibiting significant needs in social, emotional, and/or behavioral areas. Parent 
training and education wi
ll be coordinated and provided by the school's Outreach Coordinator to improve parents' ability to support their children's 
learning.  Finally, the school will continue to engage parents during School Site Council, English Language Advisory Committe
e, and 
Parent Teacher 
Association meetings to promote and sustain parent involvement and home
-
school partnerships.

s and updates are reviewed 
immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the visitor policy, monthly emergency practice drills, e
mergency materials, and 
evacuation procedures. The plan is submitted to the school board, teachers, and 
parent organizations for review.

their student.
 
 
Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch and after school. Supervi

among campus supervisors, teachers, staff and the administrators. To maintain cons
tant communication, campus supervisors carry two

The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake stan
dards. Safety drills, including
