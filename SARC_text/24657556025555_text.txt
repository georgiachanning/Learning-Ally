Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

enrollment of 776 students. Los Banos Elementary is located on 8.5 acres on the rural west side of the Central Valley. 
There are 18 classrooms, 18 portables, an office, library, computer lab, resource room, cafeteria/
central kitchen and the 
district Information Services department. Our staff includes a principal, assistant principal, 3 secretaries, 1 Health Aide,

Our mission is to create a positive, student centered, academic environment where students learn to be good citizens as 
they strive to meet or exceed the 
rigorous Common Core California State Standards (CCSS). Our goal is to create a 
foundation that will enable all students to find success at the higher levels of learning and develop a sense of community.
 
 
The focus of our vision is on student achievement. 
 
Los Banos Elementary staff will work collaboratively to ensure that all 
students learn skills that will prepare them for secondary and post
-
secondary education. Classroom teachers support and 
plan instructional activities using the state adopted core mate
rials, and research
-
based strategies (i.e. differentiated 
instruction, modeling, TPR, cooperative groups, etc.) to ensure that all students are successful.  Student data is collected 
and analyzed from formal and informal assessments.  Using a shared delive
ry model, special education inclusion 
specialists, speech therapists, resource teacher and administration collaborate with classrooms as a team to support 
teachers.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Los Banos Elementary, we

vailable as interventions as well. System 44 serves 31 students who have been identified as reading 2 
years below grade level and are on all tracks. Parent education is also offered throughout the year.
