By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review pro
cess includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adopti
on committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
ad
option committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curricu
lum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core 
curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have co
re curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Stone Avenue Elementary School provides a positive, safe, and clean environment for learning. Our custodial staff 
consisting of one daytime and on
e and a half evening custodians perform basic cleaning operations in every classroom. 
Lawns are mowed and trimmed and members of the grounds department sweep sidewalks. Five different agencies make 
periodic inspections to ensure safety at Stone Avenue Elem
entary. In addition, a formal inspection by the Supervisor of 
Maintenance and operations occurs three times each year to ensure that pre
-
established standards are met inside and 
outside each building and in the parking lots. A new two
-
story building was co
mpleted in 2016 and now houses an 
additional 8 classrooms.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

to facilitate a two

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Stone Avenue Elementary School, in accordance with Senate Bill 187, has safe school strategies that include information 
on the status of school crime and the following elements: safe school programs, child abuse 
reporting procedures, disaster 
response procedures, suspension and expulsion policies pursuant to Education Code Section 48900, 48915, and 49079, 
the Districts Discipline Handbook and Sexual Harassment Policy, our school dress code, and procedures and rule
s for safety 
on the way to and from school as well as during school hours. The school safety plan was most recently reviewed and 
updated on February 26, 2019.  Emergency supplies, blankets, first aid supplies, radios, flashlights and tools are available 
du
ring a disaster or emergency.
 
 
Stone Avenue participates in the multiple disaster drills and the California Great Shakeout in October in order to help 
prepare staff in emergency situations. Fire Drills are conducted on a monthly basis during different time
s of the day to 
ensure staff and students are prepared in case of emergency.
 
 
Stone Avenue also implements PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports) and Social Emotional Learning for 
positive school
-
wide behavior. Each month positive behavior exp
ectations are highlighted. Students demonstrating 
positive behavior and conducting themselves as role models are rewarded with Character Awards.  The Character Award 
is given each month.  As part of PBIS/SEL,  all students are also taught behavior expectat
ions for each area of the school 
(classrooms, walkways, cafeteria, assemblies, etc.).  As the school year progresses and data is gathered, students may be 
re
-
taught behavior expectations in the same way they would be re
-
taught an academic skill or concept 
to achieve mastery.  
Students learn the expectations through daily, explicit instruction, modeling, and reinforcement. All staff members 
throughout the school are committed to the process and use common language to reinforce the learning. Students are 
taug
ht a social skill each week.  Data is collected to improve our services to the students. Information is analyzed by the 
PBIS and grade
-
level teams to determine what specific behaviors need focus. This information helps us improve 
supervision, facilitate re
-
teaching of behavior expectations and address specific school needs.
