Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent/Family 
Involvement
 
 

Board honors the reciprocal responsibility which exists between the home and the school in the education of children. For 
t
his reason, continued parental involvement in the education of children contributes greatly to student achievement and 

to education. Pare
nts and guardians are strongly encouraged to communicate with school personnel so the home and 
school are reinforcing the same goals and values the parents have set for their children. The Oroville City Elementary 
School District shall include parent invol
vement strategies as a component of instructional planning for all programs. 
Teachers, parents, and guardians can better understand and meet student needs if they work together. All school 
programs have a duty to communicate frequently with the home and to
 
help parents and guardians develop skills and 
family management techniques with support classroom learning. School staff will keep parents informed about school 
expectations. The parents will be informed regarding how they can assist their children in sup
port of classroom learning 
activities. The Board encourages staff training in effective communication with the home.
 
 
Back to School Night/Orientation : This is an opportunity for parents to meet teachers and be introduced to curriculum 
and classroom proce
dures. Everyone meets in the cafeteria to enjoy the first performance of the Central/Ishi Band and 

 
 
Open House/Multicultural Night: This is a celebra
tion of student work and accomplishments. Teachers are available to 
talk with parents. The Central/Ishi Band performs and the Parent Club provides refreshments. In addition community 
organizations are present for parent s to take advantage of supports that
 
they offer. A free BBQ takes place as well.
 
 
Parent Club: Believing that education requires a shared active commitment, the Parent Club is the bridge to link students, 
teachers, school, and community members to produce knowledgeable, responsible, producti
ve citizens who are 
motivated to continue learning. This is a parent initiated and maintained organization with more than a sixty year history. 
All parents are members of the Parent Club. All it takes to participate is getting involved. Please come to a me
eting, donate 
a few hours of time, or donate goods or services. The Parent Club helps with many of the functions that occur throughout

School Site Council: When the School Improvement Program (SIP) and the School

based Coordinated Program (SBCP) were 
established, they were envisioned as ways to increase school
-
wide effectiveness, improve student achievement, and 
better prepa
re students to be productive workers and responsible citizens. One of the principle tenets of these programs 
was that those individuals closest to the students should be more involved in making

significant decisions affecting the instructional program of t
he school. The School Site Council (SSC) was selected to be the 

to carry out these functions since it is representative of all segments o
f the school community. Being composed of the 
principal, teachers, other school personnel, parents and students, it provides a forum for all of the major players in the 
school to come together to identify common goals and established a plan to achieve thes
e goals. The SSC is not limited to 
using the supplemental resources as merely a source of money to be used to meet the demands of the moment or to 
purchase a single fixed solution. Instead, it should establish and maintain a vision of the skills and knowle
dge students will 
need to be competitive in a modern economy and use the available supplemental resources, along with the existing base 

ith 

ct 
become part of an integrated improvement project.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Oroville City Elementary School District has a comprehensive safety plan, which is reviewed and updated annually in 
January with the School Site Councils. Teachers have input into the process, and as revisions are made, students and staff 
are informed of n
ew information, or trained in new procedures. This plan includes steps for mitigation and prevention, 
preparedness, response to crisis, and recovery. Specific steps for response to a variety of possible crises is included in th
e 
plan, as well as in a flip
-
chart posted near the door of each classroom for quick reference. Monthly drills are held to teach 
and reinforce procedures for fire, earthquake, and lockdown. Safety meetings are held monthly as well, to document any 
safety issues and their resolution.

The primary focus for teachers and staff at Central for the last three years has revolved around new adoptions, technology, 
Common Core implementation, ELD and Trauma sensitive schools. This year Central has added SEL to its repertoire. 
Teachers and staff 
alike receive at least (5) 2+ hour trainings each school year. Many staff and teachers choose to attend 
many more training's, voluntarily, throughout the school year and summer months. In addition, concepts and new ideas 
are shared during staff meetings an
d collaboration time. When the training's relate to implementation of new programs 
teachers are coached through peer coaching techniques, teacher
-
principal meetings and data analysis.
