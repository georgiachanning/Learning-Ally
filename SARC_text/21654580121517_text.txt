School Description
 
 
Mission Statement: Short Elementary School prepares all of our learners with the skills, knowledge, 
and habits of mind necessary to achieve and sustain advanced levels of intellectual, social and 
emotional being.Both 
now and in the future, Short School students will be pioneers in thriving 
communities, locally and globally.
 
 
The Short School campus is located in the heart of the Gerstle Park neighborhood of San Rafael. 
With the largest enrollment in over 30 years, the 
district is using all of its available facilities to 
accommodate its incoming students. Short has evolved in this, its eighth year, to host a Transitional 
Kindergarten class, one second grade class, one third grade class, and two fourth/fifth combination 
c
lass.
 
 
Students participate in enrichment activities such as physical education, music, yoga, and art 
through partnerships with local agencies such as Young Imaginations, Youth in Arts, and the Marin 
Shakespeare Company. We are a school committed to Englis
h Language instruction wherein 
students learn language through meaningful content and research
-
based strategies via the SEAL 
model in Transitional Kindergarten and first grades and GLAD in 2nd and 3rd Grades until the SEAL 
model rolls up. At the site level
, we provide professional development, coaching, and model 
classrooms in balanced literacy and Mathematics, including the Common Core aligned 
mathematical practices. 
 
 
The active parent community is engaged and is constantly planning community events to 
help raise 
money to support the various enrichment programs, technology, and other tools for learning. 
 
 

 

 
Our diverse community is unique, celebrated, and one of our greatest assets.
 

 
Each student and family feels welcome and 
experiences an empowering education at 
every school.
 

 
Our high expectations and skillful instruction enable students to think critically, respect 
others, embrace learning, and develop personal responsibility.
 

 
Each student graduates college/career ready and 
prepared to determine his/her own 
future.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teachers and administrators from all 
subject areas form working committees to draft recommendations 
on instructional materials.
 
 
The California Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the sta
te schedule for these 
adoptions and has
 
purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are aligned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory Council reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Council recommendations are forwarded to the Board of Education for f
inal approval. This is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.
 
 
This table shows some of the textbooks used with grade K

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At Short Elementary School, the campus is orderly, and students feel safe at school. The school ensures that on
-
site 
supervision is provided for programs 
that take place before and after school. Students who arrive before the 8:45 a.m. school starting time are provided with supe
rvision from school staff 
commencing at 8:15 a.m.
 
 
In August of 2016, we added a comprehensive
, user
-
friendly library to our campus. It is used by students on a weekly basis. In addition, in October of 

tions have added to the
 
morale of our school community.
 
 
District and school policy require that during the school day all guests to the campus check in at the school office and obta

them for security personnel and all staff and students.
 
 
The dist
rict strives to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classrooms, and offices are cleaned d
aily. Students are 
encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs neces
sary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. An online maintenance order request process is used to ensure efficient s
ervice and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 

ed Maintenance Program, which provided state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with 
expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components, became inoperative effective July 1, 201
3. Howeve
r, the district 
continues to make an annual contribution to support capital improvement projects, including deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
San Rafael voters approved Measure A in November 2015 to fund capital facilities projects to improve our school faci
lities. Measure A provides $108 

 
 
SRCS' bond program is providing much needed capital improvements to our facilities to create safe, innovative learning enviro
nments and to provide 
in
structional technology to support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs and equipment are being built and improv
ed to reduce 
overcrowding in our schools and to better meet the growing demand for hands
-
on science, technology, engineering, arts 
and math (STEAM) classes. Site 

hese improvements, and the 
construction work is ongoing throughout the district.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 
Date Reviewed and Updated: August 21, 2019  Date Discussed with School Faculty: August 21, 2019.
 
 
Short Elementary has a comprehensive school safety plan covering all aspects of planning for emergency response and student s
afety. This plan is based 
on and 
coordinated with the district and county emergency preparedness plans. The plan is reviewed with school staff at the start of
 
the school year. 
The plan is updated annually to increase preparedness for any emergency, including storms, fire, earthquake, or i
ntruders on campus. Disaster drills are 
held once a semester throughout the year. The school also participates in an annual county
-
wide disaster preparedness drill.  We work closely with Bill 
Welch our district's safety consultant, to keep our safety plan 
current, and to train our staff.
 
 
Key elements in the school safety plan include: disaster procedures, abuse reporting procedures, suspension/expulsion policie
s, sexual harassment 
policies, school dress code, and school discipline policies. We work with ou
r district consultant, who is aligning the districts practices in the area of school 
safety to ensure that our protocols are up to date.
