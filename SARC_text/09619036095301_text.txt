By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

academics and behavior. 
 
 
Sierra House Elementary has initiated higher level technology use 
throughout the school day. SMART Boards, document 
cameras, and Chromebooks are installed in every classroom. Students regularly use a variety of technology systems to 
help enhance learning most recently including Mystery Science, Prodigy, Seesaw, and Gizmo
s among others. We integrate 
computer technology education into our curriculum through STEAM and all students K

INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS
 
Textbook selection is accomplished via a 
district
-
wide process involving teachers from the elementary schools. The staff 

adopting textbooks. This process provides our professi
onal staff with the input necessary to ensure that up
-
to
-
date 
materials of high quality are available to our students. Sierra House is currently using the following texts adopted from 
the most recent state
-
approved list: McGraw
-
Hill Math 2014, McGraw
-
Hill 
ELA 2017, Pearson My World/Mi Mundo was 
adopted 5/28/2019, and McGraw Hill Science 2008. Google Chromebooks and netbooks are available for students for a 1 
to 1 ratio in grades K
-
5.
 
 
Scoot Pad, Seesaw Raz Kids, Reading A
-
Z, Brain Pop, IXL Learning, and Ref
lex Math are some of the online programs 
available for improving academic performance and for intervention. Reading Intervention, SIPPS, and Sonday programs 
are available for K
-
 
5th grade struggling readers. Our school library is open and available to stud
ents, and is well equipped 
with new books, encyclopedias, and dictionaries. ALEKS is available as an intervention math program in grades 4 and 5.  
Gizmos is a science and math program available to all 3
-
5 students.
 
 
All staff, parents, and students have th
e opportunity to refer to our Student Study Team any student who is having 
difficulty in academics, social, emotional, or behavioral progress. The Sierra House staff believes in providing the least 
restrictive program for our students. In other words, a st
udent will not be pulled from a regular class for extra help unless 
it will greatly benefit them. The student body, including numerically significant subgroups, are assessed through multiple 
measures including MAP assessments in grades 3
-
5 and growth of CA
ASPP scores.
 
 
Our RSP programs support the regular core academic curriculum. Any non
-
English speaking or bilingual student is 
evaluated with the ELPAC to determine their needs. ELD is also a part of the regular class program for our English learners 
with t
eachers using GLAD and SADIE strategies.
 
 
CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENT
 
Training and curriculum activities tailored to the school are essential for maintaining and improving our instructional 
program. General staff development activities and inservices include AV
ID, ELD, and writing/ literacy trainings each month 
at our focused collaboration meetings. ALl faculty is invited to participate in the District Literacy Committee as we develop
 
focused strategies to improve writing across the district.  All faculty is enc
ouraged to attend AVID trainings at SCOE AVID 
regional center.  Our site technology coordinator offers 30 minute trainings as the need arises on current topics in order 
to support implementation of technology in the classroom.  Staff was provided with a fu
ll day Trauma informed practice 
training in August as well as a half day of TRIBES PD to help with start of the year community building and classroom 
management techniques.
 
 
Sierra House has created and implemented designated uninterrupted block periods fo
r ELA and math instruction. Sierra 
House School has also created and implemented an ELD focus group to strategically focus on ELL and Hispanic subgroups. 
Class size reduction has been in place at kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grades. Instructional assist
ants are assigned to 
grade levels at concentrated instructional times in Language Arts and/or math and are part of a continuing coaching 
program to empower their instruction. Sierra House has four all
-
day kindergarten classes.
 
 
LEARNING CLIMATE
 
The teachin
g staff at Sierra House works hard to provide good discipline practices and fair treatment of students. 
Recognition that every student needs and deserves an advocate is built into the program. The staff firmly believes that 
students who feel good about the
mselves and have opportunities to receive recognition tend to perform better 
academically and socially. Students and staff adhere to the concept of Respect and Responsibility as guiding principles to 
a positive school culture. Since classroom disruptions i
nterfere with the delivery of quality instructional programs, the 
staff utilizes various behavior management techniques. Measures to deal with attendance issues are also an important 
part of our program. Recognition of students for their positive efforts i
n academics and/or behavioral areas is 
acknowledged through various programs such as PBIS, award assemblies, morning announcements, Pizza with the 
Principal, after
-
school movies, and recognition in the newspaper.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES AND SAFETY
 
Sierra House School is well maintain
ed, clean, safe, and provides an extremely positive atmosphere for learning to take 
place. The Safe School Plan for our school has two components: 1) To empower each individual on our campus, provide 
them with an advocate, and develop an awareness of self
-
responsibility for all and 2) Improve the staff's ability to 
effectively lead their class through an emergency and communicate necessary information before, during, and after an 
emergency. Sierra House School completed a modernization project in September 
2005 and the upper pod, multi
-
purpose 
room, and main hallways were renovated in 2019 after a fire in our school's reading intervention rooms. Sierra House has 
a large playground consisting of blacktop, renovated turf, and playground equipment.  The blackto
p near the school was 
replaced in 2019 and the entire playground surface was patched and sealed.  In November 2014, two growing domes were 
built on the west side of campus to support the school
-
wide theme of Fitness, Health and Mountain Sports. Monthly 
sch
ool safety, evacuation, shelter
-
in
-
place, and lockdown drills reinforce our safety preparedness procedures that are 
reviewed with all students and staff. Campus supervision is provided by teachers and classified personnel.

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] f
or English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are l
inked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

This year, due to a late start for teachers at Sierra House, we had 9 days of PD/collaboration and planning time prior to 
the start of the year. This time included Trauma informed practices, building community in the classroom through TRIBES, 
AVID methodol
ogies, safety protocols and practices, and vertical and horizontal articulation across curricular areas.   
Typically, LTUSD teachers participate in one day of staff development at the beginning of the school year. The day is a site 
day in which the staff m
eets to go over data and discuss our instructional priorities for the year. Our primary areas for 
staff development have been implementing Common Core State Standards, Understanding and Implementing Trauma 
Informed Practices, Professional Learning Communit
ies, Academic Vocabulary, English Language Development, Response 
to Intervention (RTI), Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), Sonday and SIPPS implementation. Teachers 
collaborate twice per month; once as a grade level and once with writing/ AVI
D/ELD as a focused collaboration. We are 
adding a monthly meeting for vertical articulation paid for through site professional development funds.  In addition, we 
have monthly staff meetings that focus on modeling best practices in our school
-
wide focus ar
eas.
 
 
Professional development is delivered on
-
site during focused collaborations and off
-
site through conference/workshop 
attendance.  Our professional development focus is: Common Core State Standards, RTI implementation, PBIS 
implementation, SEL (social
-
emotional) strategies, English Language Development, Advancement Via Individual 
Determination, and this year, writing with Step Up to Writing Trainings. Tri
-
annual data analysis meetings are held during 
which we use current data to develop appropriate int
erventions and differentiated instructional supports, and SIPPS and 
Sonday implementation.  Analyzing data in these meetings also assists in planning future PD as we determine areas of 
instructional strengths and areas of opportunity. These meetings also d
etermine school
-
wide responses to interventions. 
Teachers are supported through open dialogue, on going support in needed areas, and collaboration. In addition, informal 
classroom walk
-
throughs, observations, and the evaluation cycle are focused on support
ing teacher growth.
 
 
In 2019
-
2020, every teacher had 10 days prior to the start of classes, and we spend two 40 minute sessions a month 
working as a staff or grade levels on AVID, writing and EL strategies to improve instruction and student outcomes.  Thes
e 
bi
-
monthly PD/collaboration sessions add up to approximately 2 days of Staff Development over the course of the year.
 
 
In addition to all staff trainings, we have many teachers attend trainings throughout the year that are specific to their 
needs. Indivi
dual teachers are encouraged to attend 1 day AVID trainings at SCOE throughout the year.  We recently had 
4 teachers attend a 1
-
day Step up to Writing training at the El Dorado County Office of Education and we are sending 2 
teachers to guided reading diff
erentiation conference in Sacramento in February.
