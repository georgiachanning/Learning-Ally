About the SARC
 
By Fe
bruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fu
nding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
stat
e and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Instructional Mat
erials
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Walnut Grove Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California Sta
te Standards. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopte
d by the State Board of Education.
 
The district follows the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social 
science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified Sc
hool District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Co
de ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the di
strict to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) 
sufficient textbooks and instructional materials 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent 
with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula.  During the 2019
-
20 school 
year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home.  These materials co
mplied with the state's c
ontent 
standards and curriculum frameworks.
