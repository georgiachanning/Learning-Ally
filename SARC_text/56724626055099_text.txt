School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parkview Elementary School is one of 11 schools in the Hueneme Elementary School District. C
lasses are arranged on a 
traditional schedule comprised of trimesters. Kindergarten students attend for an extended day, leaving at 1:30 p.m. 
Approximately 640 students in grades kindergarten through five were enrolled during the most recent year. Of these
, 
more than half of the total student body are classified as English learners (please see data tables included in this SARC) 
and 81.3% qualified for the free or reduced lunch program.  All of our students receive free lunch and breakfast because 
we are a P
rovision II school. Parkview is in its second year of implementing a 50/50 Two Way Bilingual Program.  Parkview 
strives to improve student performance in English/Language Arts, Math and English Language Development using 
collaboration around student data, 
implementation of research
-
based practices, and the encouragement of parental 
involvement.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
This year, Parkview 
School had approximately 50 regular volunteers. Many parents volunteer in classrooms, attend field 
trips, and participate in schoolwide activities. Our School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee provide the 
opportunity for parent contributi
ons and input into decisions regarding our school.  Parents also have the opportunity to 
participate in monthly parent meetings during which parents can learn ways to help their children succeed in school and 
give input regarding school programs.  Parent m
eeting topics include Loving Solutions  parenting classes, Dual Immersion 
informational meetings, and community support resources.
 
 
Parents are invited to participate in our PTA which, this year, will sponsor several fundraisers with the goal of providing 
music and cultural assemblies, additional books for the school's library, and providing funds for enriching field trips for 
each classroom.  If you are interested in opportunities for parental involvement, please contact the Principal, Cara 
Comstock, at 80
