School Description
 
Moreno Elementary School helped lay the foundation of learning in our 
community over one 
hundred years ago. We take pride in our continued tradition of building educational success for all 
children. We are proud of the splendor of our current campus surroundings with flourishing 
majestic trees and open spaces. Our students t
hrive as well in a learning environment that is safe, 
rigorous, relevant, and responsible. 
 
 

students have had consistent growth and improvement in both Math and 
English Language Arts on 


Assessments (CFA) using curriculum based tests, Sm
arter Balance Interim Assessment Blocks 
(IAB's), and Measurements of Academic Progress (MAP) student scores. Teachers analyze CFA data 
collectively, and then they collaborate and clarify on what students are expected to learn, identify 
those not learning, 
and find ways to help them learn, as well as challenge students already 

goals each trimester as a means to encourage the students to take control of their own 
responsibility for their education so that they are committed to continual growth and desire to 
succeed academically. 
 
 
Moreno uses Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) to ensure that students 
understand behavior expectations and have interv
entions in place to support students with their 


heritage while rei
nforcing our common bonds with an emphasis on being responsibility, respectful 
and safe. 
 
 

Family events including, Back to School Night, Open House, Multicultur
al Night, Technology 
Day/Night, Math Night, Technology Night and Literacy Night provide opportunities for families to 
participate with activities at school. PTA also provides social events for families including the Fall 
Festival, Daughters' Masquerade Dan
ce, Sons' Dance/Activity, and the Christmas Shoppe, 
 
 
We're happy to have many valued volunteers helping daily on campus assisting teachers, the 
library, and with school events. We believe that Informative, interactive, and consistent 
communication between
 

made the most of communicating with parents of our students with disabilities by enabling our 
teachers to build a highly touted Basic Skills learning program. Moreno works to bridge inte
ractions 
between general and special education students by integrating students in activities and in weekly 
STEAM rotations and the Skittle Pop Inclusion weekly recess activities.

to adjust instruction based on results, and to provide su
pportive and timely feedback, based on student strengths, for students 
to meet more standards and improve achievement.

assisting th
eir children.

an environment with clear expectations, consistent consequences, 
and specific, articulated, academic goals.
 
About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents enrich the quality of our school climate and play an integral role in the academic success of all students in our sch
ool. Moreno Elementary has 
many opportunities for student families to get involved with Parent Teache
rs' Association (PTA). The PTA and parent volunteers support and promote 
the following: Red Ribbon Week, teacher and class support, field trips, rewards and incentives, student competitions, attenda
nce and academic 
awards/trophies, and more. Our PTA has be
en recognized as an outstanding unit in MVUSD. Community involvement is further evidenced by support 
from area businesses and civic organizations in academic programs, student recognition activities, and partnerships.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC), Safety
 
Committee, African American Parent Advisory Committee (AAPAC), and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
strengthen parent participation by providing forums for input on matters such as curriculum, budget, support programs, as wel
l as special service
s and 
needs. Many school events such as the Parent Book Club, Multi
-
Cultural Event, Black History student performances, Family Fun Festivals, and Math 
Nights, Technology Nights and Literacy Family Nights give parents the opportunity to participate in their
 
child's education.
 
 
Parent volunteers are welcome on the site to work in classrooms and to help with school activities such as Picture Day, Field
 
Day, STEAM Activities, Career 
Day or for grade level or classroom celebrations. Parent volunteers support tea
chers and students  on field trips.
