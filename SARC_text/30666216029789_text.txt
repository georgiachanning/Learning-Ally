By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

instructional programs, academic achievement, materials facilities and staff. Information about Orange 
Unified School 
District is also provided. Fairhaven School is one of twenty
-
seven (27) elementary schools in the Orange Unified School 
District, and the only one located in the city of Santa Ana. The school was built in June 1966 on 9.3 acres of land and i
s 
located on Fairhaven Avenue between Grand and Tustin Avenues. Fairhaven provides Preschool and Transitional 
Kindergarten through 6th Grade educational services and houses two special day classes for students with special needs. 
Students come from a varie
d range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Approximately 550 students in Transitional 
Kindergarten through 6th grade attend Fairhaven.
 
 
Fairhaven Elementary takes a child
-
centered approach to education.  Every child has the capacity to learn and the right
 
to 
the best possible education.  Instruction is differentiated to meet the individual student's needs and learning styles. 
Fairhaven has a diagnostic Response to Intervention and Instruction system in place where every student is given a 
universal screeni
ng assessment three times per year.  The results of these assessments guide teachers in forming 
homogeneous groups where the specific needs of each student are addressed.
 
We are committed to creating a safe and caring environment that fosters the intellect
ual, social, emotional and physical 
growth of each student. The development of literacy, critical thinking, and problem solving sills are crucial to the success 
of our students as we focus on vocabulary development and reading comprehension. As the result 
of our outstanding 
program,  Fairhaven was selected to receive the title of a National Blue Ribbon School in 2012 and a California Gold Ribbon 
School and a Title 1 Achievement School in 2016 along with The Civic Learning Award in 2019.
 
 
We encourage our pa
rents and community members to become involved and familiar with Fairhaven School. The Falcon 
Newsletter is sent home monthly and informs the community of past news and upcoming events. In addition we have a 
Fairhaven Facebook page to inform parents of wee
kly activities and to share student successes. Teachers send home 
communications folder; 4th
-
6th Grade teachers send a daily agenda. Our vision is: Students, families, and staff work as 
partners to ensure that all students meet and/or exceed their learning
 
and educational goals. Fairhaven's Mission is:  
Fairhaven Elementary School provides optimal learning for all students in all curricular areas, and remains focused on the 
whole child's social, emotional, physical, and academic needs.  Families, students, 
and staff at Fairhaven Elementary 
School work together to provide a positive learning and teaching environment, which promotes success for all.  Our goal 
is for all students to raise their achievement levels and become productive and positive members of th
e wider community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Maintaining the appearance, safety and functionality of Fairhaven Elementary is important. During the school year we 
concentrate on working with s
tudents and staff to keep the facility clean and sanitary. Classrooms are cleaned throughout 
the day as needed. The campus houses 17 portables and 15 permanent classrooms to accommodate 520 students in 
grades TK
-
6.  The campus also houses a library facilit
y with wireless Internet access, a computer lab for 35 students, a 
multipurpose room, two Special Day Classes, Intervention Teacher Instructional specialist, Inclusion specialist , and Speech 
and Language Specialist services. Fairhaven Elementary School is
 
maintained by two full time custodians. One works during 
the day, and one works the evening shift. Quarterly safety reports in regard to maintaining a safe campus are turned in to 
Risk Management twelve times during the year. The school is supported for a
dditional maintenance and repair by the 
district maintenance and operations department. The current report indicates some damage to some of the sink cabinets 
and mirrors in classrooms and restrooms. Work orders have been submitted to correct the issues.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the ach
ievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updated their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to 
the schools and 
maintains a file of individual school plans available for inspection by the public. Fairhaven's Safe School 
Plan was last approved by the School Site Council on February 19,2019.
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills 
are conducted monthly. Lockdown Drills take 
place four time per year as safe practice for a variety of reasons. All schools in the district are linked through an emergen
cy 
radio contact system and district radio drills are held periodically to be prepared 
in case of an actual disaster. The school 
and District work closely with the municipalities in its preparations for a possible emergency. Providing a safe environment 
for our students is of paramount emphasis at Fairhaven. Fairhaven is a closed
-
campus scho
ol. The school gates are locked 
at 8:00 am and remain locked until the end of the school day. All visitors must check in through the office. The front office
 
door is open during school hours so that parents have access to the office. Administration, teache
rs and Noon Supervisors 
provide supervision during recesses, egress and ingress. To ensure school safety before and after school, the city of Santa 
Ana provides a crossing guard.  Each year we practice our emergency Preparedness Plan. Our staff is constant
ly on the 
alert to make our school a safe place for students. We take pride in creating a positive learning environment for our 
students. Each teacher implements a classroom management plan and provides a copy to parents at the beginning of the 
school year
. Our school wide plan is designed around our school's Positive Behavior and Support (PBIS) expectations. In 
addition Fairhaven starts the year with the Start With Hello to encourage kindness and inclusion of all students.

techniques, consultations to improve student performance, and assistance in establishing schoolwide and grade level 
programs to support student achievement. Fairhaven t
eachers participate in professional development opportunities that
