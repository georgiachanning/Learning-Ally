School Description
 
Principals Message
 
Welcome to Hanson Elementary!
 
The Hanson Elementary School staff promise each of our families to provide the highest quality of 
Standards Based instruction to all students and to hold students, parents, and each other to the 
highest standards of performance. We shall accept no limits o
n the learning potential of any child. 
Teachers create serious classroom learning environments focused on grade level standards and 

and conferences.
 
 
Staff col
laborates regularly with colleagues to seek and implement more effective strategies for 
helping each child to achieve his or her academic potential. We continually review our instruction 
in the classroom using assessment data and quick checks for understan
ding and to modify 
instruction when needed to ensure student understanding of the lessons.
 
 
The Hanson staff identifies and meets the individual learning needs of each child both in the 
classroom as well as during an additional instruction time called Resp
onse to Intervention. During 
this focused instructional time every student receives additional Reading and Language Arts 
instruction specifically targeted to meet his or her needs. Students will continue with instruction, 
be given a new learning goal, or m
ove groups depending upon their successes. Hanson teachers 
work closely with the Imagine Learning and DreamBox programs which provides computerized 
lessons and tutorials for each child based upon his/her individual MAP score. The teachers use 
assessments w
ithin the program based upon current standards based instruction. If a student 
experiences problems with a new concept he/she will be assigned additional lessons within Imagine 
Learning or DreamBox to help him/her better understand what the teacher is teac
hing.
 
 
Hanson staff promise each of our families to do whatever it takes to ensure that your children 
achieve or exceed grade level academic expectations.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
la
w to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required t
o prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
c
onsistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more infor
mation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school
 
principal or the 
district office.

Hanson Elementary has an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with growing numbers of newly involved parents. We have over
 
100 regular parent 
and community volunteers working in the classrooms or helping with special events
. Our School Site Council (SSC) includes parents whose children receive 
support services from a variety of categorical programs. We also have an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), which is 
enjoying greater parent 
participation and involvement. We w
elcome parents to share their special interests and skills in club activities for our students, and we invite parents to 
contact our volunteer coordinator throughout the school year.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: S
chool Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The purpose of our School Safety Plan is to have procedures in place to ensure the safety and well
-
being o
f our students in the face of natural disasters 
and other threats to campus security. Student safety is our first priority. We have worked with and received training from la
w enforcement, fire 
protection, and Safe Schools trainers over the past few years t
o ensure a viable, comprehensive and practiced School Safety Plan.
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed yearly receiving input from parents and staff on the School Site Council. Hanson has an em
ergency evacuation plan 
that addresses all emergency situations
. The emergency plan is shared with parents throughout the school year at English Language Learner Parent 
meetings, Parent Teacher Organization meetings, and School Site Council meetings.

Types of Services Funded
 
We believe all students can learn, and we recognize that all students learn and retain information in different ways. For stu
dents with differing learning 
styles or disabilities, RUSD has a wide variety of intervention programs. The District provides regul
ar education, categorical programs and additional 
educational opportunities designed to help all students meet or exceed grade
-
level standards and to prevent students from falling behind. Federal 
categorical and additional educational opportunities are fun
ded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was reauthorized in 2015 
as the Every Student Succeeds Act. These programs include, Title I (English Language Arts and Mathematics support); Title II 
(Improving Teacher Quality); 
Title III (supp
ort for English Language Acquisition and improving Family Engagement); Title IV (support for elementary music and PE and seco
ndary 
technology and vaping cessation). State funding provides supplemental dollars so the District can provide additional service 
to unduplicated count 
students, including foster youth, English language learners, homeless youth, and students of low income families. RUSD offers
 
a wide variety of alternative 
education programs and settings, including the Ramona Community Campus which h
ouses the Ramona Community Montessori School (TK
-
6) and Mt. 
Valley Academy (TK
-
12 School/Independent Study); Future Bound (7
-
12 off campus Independent Study); and Montecito Continuation High School (9
-
12).
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides
 
reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are pu
blicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a
 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the abili
ty to print 
documents.
