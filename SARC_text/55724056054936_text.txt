By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Summerville Elementary held a public hearing on August 13, 2019, and determined that the school had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, 
instructional materials or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of 
California.  All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or 
instructional materials, or both, 
in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.  Textbooks and instructional 
materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the textbooks 
used in the school the most current available.  Ma
terials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of the teachers and principal.  All 
recommended materials are available for parent examination at the dist
rict office prior to adoption.  The table displays 
information collected in September 2019 about the quality and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, Summerv
ille Elementary is piloting two 
different science curricula with the intention of adopting during the Spring of 2020. More information will be posted later 
this school year.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Summerville Elementary was originally 
constructed in 1906 and is comprised of 25 classrooms, gym, multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, library, staff lounge, computer lab, and playgrounds. Last year, the district used Proposition 39 funds to 
replace a number of HVAC units and upgraded the outdoor and 
classroom lighting with LED bulbs.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The maintenance and operations director works daily with the custodial and maintenance staff of 4 (2 full
-
time and 3 part
-
time employees) to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to provid
e for a clean and safe school. The district 
governing board has adopted cleaning standards for the school and all other district sites. A summary of these standards 
are available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenan
ce staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service.  The highest priority is given to 
emergency repairs. While reviewing t
his report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection 
process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation. Deferred Maintenance 
Budget The district participates in the State School D
eferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a 
dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating
, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, 
and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The 
safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Summerville Elementary. The school and district is always in 
compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The 
School Site Safety plan
 
was last reviewed and updated by March 2019 by the School Safety Committee. All revisions were 

ensuring student and staff safety during 
a disaster.
 
 
Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held twice a year. 
Students are supervised before and after school by certificated staff and classified staff, and classified staff and t
he 
principal supervise students during lunch. Certificated staff and classified staff help with supervision during lunch and 
break periods. There is a designated area for student drop
-
off and pick up. Visitors are required to sign in at the office 
during s
chool hours.
