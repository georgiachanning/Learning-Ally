By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Strong achievement for all students is the highest priority for Tustin Unified School District. Multi
-
tiered systems of support 
will be developed and implemented to addr
ess the academic, behavioral, attendance, and social
-
emotional needs of all 
students as they engage in a standards

assessment data and attendance metric.  The target subgroup for both areas is Hispanic. High standards, quality 
instruction, strong collaboration, and a strong sense of community guide Red Hill in achievin
g our mission. Our strength 
comes in the dedication all members of the Red Hill community have to provide an outstanding educational experience 
through strong programs for our students. The curriculum is both rigorous and comprehensive. Differentiated inst

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Constructio
n (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Inspection
-
Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in g
ood repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Red Hill is a newer facility, built in 2001, and is maintained in excellent 
condition. Two additional shade structures in the 
lunch area were added in October 2008 with a third shade structure installed in the kindergarten play area in October 
2018 to provide more comprehensive protection from the sun. Classrooms are organized alo
ng a covered, outdoor 
pedestrian paseo.  A large multi
-
purpose room serves as the performing arts center and music room.  The school is 
networked and wired to accommodate teaching and learning technologies that include technology centers. A data 
network an
d multimedia delivery system provide latest computer software to assist with student learning
-
controlled by 
teachers in the classrooms.  SMART Boards, Apple TV, projectors, amplification systems, and document cameras are in 
each classroom to support studen
t engagement.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achieve
ment (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alterna
te Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement
 
standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
th
e University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

classrooms, and extra certificated staff to 
support instruction in physical education and social
-
emotional learning. Funding also supports professional development, 
equipment, instructional materials, technology, books, and media. Red Hill staff members a
ctively pursue outside grant

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides inte
nsive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year. 
 
Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effect
ive instruction.
 
 
Red Hill teachers are committed to providing an engaging and challenging instructional program for all students.  This 
commitment leads to teachers continually developing as professionals and pursuing opportunities to maintain life
-
long 
l
earning.  Teachers can participate in Professional Development through district offerings, as well as through the school 
site.  Training focuses on the areas of Dyslexia, Balanced Literacy, Cognitively Guided Instruction for Mathematics, Digital 
Storytelli
ng, Social
-
Emotional Learning, and Technology.  Additional professional development opportunities throughout 
the school year are determined by teacher surveys in conjunction with assessment data. On selected Wednesdays each 
month, time is allotted for teac
hers to participate in these learning opportunities to promote professional growth. Topics 
include but are not limited to: Google Classroom, Digital Storytelling, and supporting students with challenging behaviors.
 
 
Red Hill teachers are also given regular
 
release time and grade
-
level planning days to work together on school
-
wide 
accountability for state and district academic standards. In grade
-
level teams, teachers conduct ongoing analyses of 
student performance data and adjust curriculum and long
-
range l
esson plans accordingly. Grade level teams continue to 
map out strategies to meet standards and compare results of assessments to plan for additional staff development. By 
sharing strategies, teachers are able to pool understanding and organization of subj
ect matter and develop meaningful 
data from assessments, as defined by the California State Standards for teaching and learning.  Teachers have also received 
professional development in the areas of Balanced Literacy and Cognitively Guided Instruction thro
ugh a lab/teaching 
experience model for 8 days.  Teachers go into a classroom to see an element of the workshop instructional model and 
then reflect on the lesson with the District Connect Coaches.  From there, teachers plan their next steps for the delive
ry 
of instruction.  The coaching model has also been used to support teacher professional development in ELD, technology, 
and conferring with students.
