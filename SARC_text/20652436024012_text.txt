populations. ELD (English Language Development) is taught to our English learners for an average 
of 45 minutes a day. Students are grouped by their language 
levels so that instruction can be 
targeted towards their specific areas of need. The emphasis is on oral language, listening, reading, 
and writing. The District provides a benchmark testing system for our English Language Learners. 
Teachers evaluate studen
ts three to four times a year and monitor their progress. The results of 
these tests help teachers determine what skills need to be taught or reviewed.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountabil
ity Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Acc
ountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in t
he SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, se
e the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and 
Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursu
ant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take h
ome. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Educati
on, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by a
ll
 
teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of La Vina students and staff is of utmost importance. Staff and students must feel safe in order for learning to 
take place. La Vina School 
follows the Crisis Management Plan that
 
outlines key elements of our Safety Plan. Included in the plan are mandated procedures and detailed emergency 
plans. Monthly drills are held to prepare students for any possible emergency that requires evacuation of the facility. Furth
ermore, the District
 
Gang 
Prevention Officer provides yearly updates to parents and staff on gang trends and preventive measures.
 
 
La Vina School implements monthly character traits and rewards students who display positive behavior. Supervision duties are
 
vital and outlined 
extensively in our Staff Handbook. Teachers wear safety vests and ensure students are safe at all times. The School Safety Pl
an was most recently 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty on March 1, 2020.
