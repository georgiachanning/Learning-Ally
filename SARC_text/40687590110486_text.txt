About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Dorothea Lange Elementary School provides a safe environment for learning. Built in 20
05 Dorothea Lange Elementary is situated on fourteen acres. The 
school buildings span 44,977 square feet consisting of twenty
-
four classrooms, multipurpose room, library, computer lab, and administrative offices.
 
 
An addition of permanent shade structures 
over the outdoor dining/quad area was completed in November of 2017.
 
 
Lange Elementary School is a closed campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in sch
ool events. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to
 
check
-

office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults supervise students and school grounds, suc
h as the ca
feteria and 
recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and cond
uct inspections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repai
rs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff
 
has indica
ted that 100 percent 
of all toilets on school grounds are in working order. A team of custodians ensures classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms
 
are kept clean and safe. 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by Lucia Mar Unified School District
 
to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained 
and provide a suitable learning environment. A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the Distric
t office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe an
d orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their Safe School Plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies r
elated to
 
suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress 
of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
Th
e school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan,
 
are reviewed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. The Injury, Illness & Prevention Plan w
as last updated and reviewed with school staff in 
August 2019.

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic inter
ests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing workforce technology and employment 
environments in 
many industry sectors. T
herefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students graduating from the Lucia Ma
r 
Unified School District have the preparation necessary for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studie
s, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, tr
ade union leaders and 
educa
tors came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school, college and technic
al training 
environments. This resulted in the need to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that
 
engages participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opportunities within a specific industry sector. High Scho
ol Career Pathways provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in t
his scenario. 
 
 
Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one industry certification, or equivalent s
kill measurement, to provide 
a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with
 
community college career certificate and associate degree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and in some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while st
ill in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn
 
post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Education 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the St
ate Board of Education
 
in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of career pathway programs of study 
for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establ
ishing relationships with industry members and assembling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewing and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining o
utreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and 
existing pathway programs. 
 
 
The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway programs, and site administration in the areas of curricu
lum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus
. CTE teachers participate in professional development to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by attending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally, CTE instructors focu
s on pathway development 
and philosophy, which inclu
de California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affects the structural make up of
 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued to improve annually in the support of current programs that are fun
ction
ing well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from programs that currently function as a single co
urse, and establish new 
programs where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several 
CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions through the Future Farme
rs of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have a
ll had regional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Industry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid
, Food Handlers, Serv Safe, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college cred
it toward a degree within their field of study and some pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Additionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique projects that demonstra
te their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills.
 
Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are able to gain real world 
experience within their field of study that often times leads to employment.
