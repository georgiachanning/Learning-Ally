By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Perched amidst the foothills overlooking Orange, Olive Elementary School is a traditional track, kindergarten through sixth 
grade school of approximately 425 students and thirty
-
five staff me
mbers.  The school is situated on a historical site which 
has consistently housed various schools since June 6, 1876.  The original school bell is mounted at the entrance to Olive 
school. The gymnasium, once the Olive Civic Center building, has been design
ated a historical landmark by the U.S. 
Department of the Interior.  Prior to Olive's opening as a school, the property was a stopping point on the El Camino Real, 
a rest stop halfway between the San Juan Capistrano and San Gabriel of Los Angeles Missions. 
Olive School was re
-
opened 
as a public school by the Orange Unified School District in September of 1999.
 
We value and honor our cultural diversity and are proud of the cross
-
cultural participation in school events. We provide a 
strong, integrated curricul
um which includes Language Arts, Math, Science, Social Sciences, Social Emotional Learning, 
and the incorporation of instructional technology. We focus on the development of a balance of skills, knowledge, 
understanding, and application. Olive Elementary i
s committed to providing a success
-
oriented and safe learning 
environment for all students. As an AVID Elementary Showcase school, Olive teachers and staff are committed to closing 
the achievement gap and helping all students develop college and career rea
diness skills for future success.
 
It is my pleasure to invite you to read our School Accountability Report Card. Our staff models the belief that learning is a
 
life
-
long journey. We have a strategic framework for whole school improvement based upon an anal
ysis of student 
achievement and the selection of research based instructional strategies. Teachers are trained in a variety of instructional 
strategies with an emphasis on the 21st Century Teaching and Learning: the 4 Cs: communication, collaboration, crit
ical 
thinking and creativity. We recognize that in order to empower our students and prepare them for the demands of the 
future, we also need to empower ourselves. We have an Instructional Leadership Team which meets regularly to guide 
our staff through th
e process of effective research
-
proven strategies and practices. We have two mobile laptop carts, each 
with 40 laptops in our 6th grade classrooms, full Chromebook/HP Stream carts in first
--
fifth grade classrooms, as well as 
additional iPads in all classro
oms so that every student has access to technology. Instructional technology is used to 
increase and enhance student and teacher access to information, their ability to use data, their productivity and creativity.
 
Our Olive families and staff share a commo
n vision to create a community of life
-
long learners who possess strong 
character traits of respect and responsibility. The staff is committed to treating students with dignity and creating an 
environment that provides maximum opportunities for learning. O
ur goal is to provide students with a strong educational 
foundation so that they leave Olive Elementary with educational and personal experiences that have prepared students 
academically, and instilled problem solving and critical thinking skills necessary
 
to become successful 21st Century 
Learners. We provide each student with a challenging and rigorous curriculum that addresses Common Core State 
Standards. We believe every child can and will achieve academic success with proper supports. Our staff is dedi
cated to 
providing every student with quality instructional experiences which recognize, support, and maintain high expectations 
for academics and behavior. Our school district supports our vision by  providing staff development, instructional coaching, 
an
d support district wide.
 
The mission of Olive Elementary School is to become a high performing community school that engages all students in 
exemplary teaching and learning experiences that are rigorous, differentiated, meaningful and take place in a safe 
and 
orderly environment!
 
As always, we will focus on making our vision and mission the core of our daily work with children, teachers and parents. 
We are creating a culture of college readiness as we will build shared understandings about what it means, an
d ways 
parents and teachers can work together to ensure every student works to meet his/her greatest potential!
 
 
Excellence! Every Student! Every Day!

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Olive Elementary is proud of the generous support and involvement of its parents and community. Parents volunteer at 
Olive in the classroom, at assemblies, health screenings, after school enrichment programs and a number of other 
activities. Parents serve 
on the Olive Parent Teacher Club (OPTC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), School 
Site Council (SSC) and District committees such as the DELAC. Parental involvement is an essential part of helping to 
educate our children at Olive.
 
 
Olive Elementa

content related assemblies and a variety of other services. OPTC raises additional funds as scholarships to ensure every 
student is able to participate in offere
d learning opportunities. OPTC coordinates Scholastic Book Fairs, Red Ribbon Week, 
sponsors the 100 Mile Club, and provides Art Masters learning for students in Kindergarten through Fourth grade. 
Members of OPTC also assist with school picture day, yearboo

Staff Development is offered as part of the OUSD Modified Wednesdays, with 90 minute professional development 
sessions offered each month. There are also two full
-
day professional development sessions at teh start of the school year 
and another full day he
ld in early November each year.
 
Staff Development opportunities were provided through peer coaching, staff meetings, conferences, school
-
based in
-
services, and by district level staff with curriculum development in identified areas of need based on staff s
urveys and 
student data, Instructional Leadership Team feedback, and principal discretion. A comprehensive, standards based 
professional development program is essential in achieving a balanced curriculum to meet the needs of our students. 
During the 2017
-
18 school year, Olive continued a Modified Wednesday schedule to allow for site and district professional 
development in the implementation of the newly adopted ELA curriculum, with a strong focus on the use of the 
curriculum's embedded ELD lessons and ins
tructional technology tools. We have also maintained our focus on the 
effective use of GLAD strategies for English Learners, instructional strategies that support academic achievement, and 21st 
Century teaching and learning, and AVID instructional tools an
d strategies, with teachers in fifth and sixth grades being 
fully AVID trained teachers. These teachers attended the 2017 Summer AVID Institute, and met with teachers across the 
district in PLCs to further enhance AVID implementation at Olive. During the 2
018
-
19 school year, Olive staff continued 
our AVID implementation for the third year. This required teachers to attend AVID professional development sessions. 
Nine teachers and the principal attended the 2019 AVID Summer Institute, 1 teacher attended the A
VID Paths training 
with OUSD in September, and 4 teachers attended the AVID K
-
2 Paths training in November, which completed classroom 
teacher AVID training. Olive Elementary worked with the OUSD AVID coordinator and the Regional AVID Director to 
become an 
AVID Elementary Showcase school during the 2018
-
19 school year. Professional development was provided 
for teachers so that AVID can be effectively used in all academic content areas. As a CA SUMS Initiative MTSS pilot school, 
Olive also provided profession
al development in the area of social emotional learning and how to best create an 
emotionally safe learning environment for all. We also continued our work around creating and maintaining effective PLCs 
and our work together to use assessments to guide ins
truction for increased student success in areas such as reading 
comprehension, math concepts, instructional technology integration, AVID implementation, and social
-
emotional 
competency. During the 2019
-
20 school year, Olive will continue its work as an AVI
D Elementary Showcase school. We 
will collaborate with secondary to build articulation of AVID strategies for all students as they move through elementary 
school and into middle and high school. Olive's work with AVID and our 2019 SBAC data showed a need i
n the area of 
reading. Therefore, Olive teachers will be working to build their knowledge around how to implement the Critical Reading 
Process across all content areas. Teachers and the principal will actively seek opportunities for professional developmen
t 
in this area, so that we continue to offer a rigorous and 21st Century learning experience for all students. Olive teachers 
will also extend their understanding of how to support social
-
emotional learning of students by attending professional 
development
 
in Restorative Practices. Olive has used Restorative Circles to build community in classes and across our 
campus. Olive will also provide the Power of One anti
-
bullying assembly for all grade levels.
 
 
Olive has a mix of highly seasoned teachers with multi
ple years of teaching experience and a few that are newer to the 
profession who contribute new ideas. Our staff models the belief that learning is a life long journey. There are numerous 
district and on
-
site opportunities for staff to learn best instructio
nal strategies and acquire new skills. Olive's 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement specifies all activities and LCFF utilized by Olive to meet the needs of students. To reach our 
goals, professional development opportunities are designed and implemented to
 
assist the principal, teachers, and 
paraprofessionals in supporting all students in meeting the rigorous standards. The District also provides training and 
support to all teachers in areas such as  21st Century Teaching, writing (Write From the Beginning)
, math, social
-
emotional 
learning, technology, AVID, GLAD strategies, and strategies to support English Learners.
