By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Eastshore Elementary School 
thrives in a community that believes education is a partnership between the home and the 
school. The PTA, the School Site Council, parent volunteers, and support from the business community are integral to the 
ongoing success of our students. PTA provides 
enrichment opportunities through assemblies focusing on the arts and 
character education,  financial support for programs and teachers and community events which foster connectedness. 
The School Site Council participates in the monitoring of our Site Plan 
for Student Achievement and the expenditure of 
funds to enrich our curricular focus. Parent volunteers contribute many hours to the classroom through tutorial and 
clerical support. The business community is also involved by supplying our school with resour
ces to purchase equipment 
and other supplies through matching donations as well as assemblies which benefit the entire school community. Both 
our PTA and our School Site Council weigh in on the LCAP annually, providing valuable input related to fiduciary 
e
xpenditures on a district level.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Eastshore School has developed a comprehensive Safe 
School Plan. Our plan is evaluated yearly and amended, as needed, 
by the School Site Council and by the leaders of the Safe School Plan committee. Key elements of the plan include: 1. 
Assessing the current status of school crime committed on the school cam
pus and at school
-
related functions, 2a. Child 
Abuse Reporting Procedures, 2b. Disaster Procedures
-
Routine and Emergency, 2c. Policies for Suspension, Expulsion and 
Mandatory Expulsion, 2d. Procedures for Notification of Staff Regarding Dangerous Students,
 
2e. Policies on Sexual 
Harassment, 2f. Policy Relating to School Dress Code (especially gang
-
related apparel), 2g. Procedures for Safe Ingress and 
Egress of Pupils, Parents, and School Employees To and From School, 2h. Procedures that Create a Safe and Or
derly 
Environment Conducive to Learning at School, 2i. Rules and Procedures on School Discipline.
 
 
In addition, monthly fire/evacuation drills, a full simulation earthquake drill, and two shelter in place drills are schedule
d 
and implemented throughout the
 
school year to assess our level of preparedness. We purchase and replenish our 
emergency supplies annually with the help of the PTA to ensure that all students and adults on campus will be cared for 
in case of any disaster. These emergency supplies (food,
 
water, blankets, first aide, and all other emergency equipment) 
are kept in our emergency storage shed for immediate access if needed.

acco
rdingly and continue to do so after each drill to ensure a fine tuned response system.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local di
scretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SU
PPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic pro
grams, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary sci
ence, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previous

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding eq
ual to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollme
nt does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Eastshore staff participates in eighteen hours of mandated staff 
development each year.  The focus for the 2018
-
2019 
school year was behavioral support and technology  Our district adopted the practice of Professional Learning 
Communities twelve years ago and through survey data determined that PLCs have been conducted 
with a lack of fidelity 
and commitment.  The district wide effort has great implications at our site where PLC practice has been in place for 13 
years.  The additional training and re
-
defining of expectations has supported our staff in collectively working
 
toward 
effective planning time using data to inform instruction.  Two teams will participate each year in the Power Up Your PLC 
Training provided by district personnel.  Additional staff development during the 2018
-
2019 school year included safety 
trainin
g related to sheltering in place, and CPR training.  The 2019
-
2020 staff development focus is on Restorative Practices 
and Standards Based Mindset.  Staff has noticed an increase in significant behavioral issues with some of our students.  
Several staff me
mbers attended this training at OCDE during the 2018
-
2019 school year and reported positive results.  
Consequently we have devoted three of our six afternoon staff development days to Restorative Practices.  Our October 
staff development day in 2019 will b
e devoted to learning about a Standards Based Mindset.  We will also provide two 
technology trainings as we move away from traditional grading practices to standards based grading and learn how to use 
AERIES to reflect our changing practices.
