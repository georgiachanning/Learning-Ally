By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions an
d Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Stanislaus Union School District staff believe that in order to remain safe, all schools must be clean, safe, and functional.
 
School sites receive feedback from community members through surveys, 
conversations and other formal/informal means 
regarding the conditions of the site. This information along with information gained from a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction to ensure that ea
ch site, including Stanislaus 
Elementary School, is well maintained, clean, safe and functional. The results of this survey will be available at the school
 
office, at the District Office or on the internet at http://www.spsc.dgs.ca.gov/. In general, provid
ing a clean learning 
environment is a District priority. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensur
e 
a clean and safe school.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts 
made to ensure that pupils are provided 
with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.The school opened in 1950. The school has 22 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a library, two computer labs, and an administration office. The main campus was bu
ilt in 1950. 
Additions were constructed in 1954 and 1957 when the multipurpose room was completed, and again in 2019 when two 
new classrooms were added. Reconstruction was done in 1994. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs and 
work orders ar
e completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority. The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides state matching fu
nds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, 
electrical systems, interior or ex
terior painting, and floor systems. For the 2012
-
2013 school year, School Bond monies 
supplemented deferred maintenance to allow for the following projects: upgrading/updating infrastructure including 
school wide wireless internet services, upgrading/updat
ing both children and staff restrooms, alarms on roofs, re
-
carpeting staff room, secretary and nurse's offices, school wide surveillance system, construction and furnishing an 
additional computer lab, and construction of an outdoor amphitheater.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The per pupil expenditure from the General Fund for each pupil in the District last year was $10,911.00. This fund 
supports 
the basic educational program of the District. At Stanislaus Elementary School, this is essentially the cost involved in 
providing staff, textbooks, supplies, and equipment for all pupils.
 
 
School Based Coordinated Program (SBCP) funds were utiliz
ed to provide supplemental services, such as awards, literature 
books, PE equipment, teachers' in
-
service, supplies, and conference expenses for staff. In addition, the school received 
funds to provide supplemental services (personnel, materials, and equip
ment) to assist limited English proficient students 
in acquiring English.
 
 
Each year, due to fundraising efforts and high parental involvement, fundraising efforts through the Associated Student 
Body or an organized parent support group also provide fundin
g for student educational activities including assemblies 
and field trips.

training for t
he 2018
-
19 school year focused on ensuring staff fidelity of implementation of school
-
wide behavior 
expectations and on developing our Tier 2 interventions for behavior.  This 2019
-
2020 school year, we will again focus our 
professional development on ELD, 
Integration of Technology, Effective Instruction, and PBIS.  PBIS training for the 2019
-
2020 school year will focus on developing our Tier 3 systems for behavior intervention.  A renewed area of focus for our 
site this year is on the development of our Res
ponse to Intervention system.  All professional development provided by 
Stanislaus Union School District is aligned to grade level standards, current adoptions, and needs assessments. The site 
administrator and staff continue to receive training in the use
 
of data management systems which allows for common 
conversations regarding analysis of student data.
