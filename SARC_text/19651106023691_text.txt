By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Mill District was formed in 1898. Portions of this territory were added and lost until the last portion was annexed from 
Rowland District on July 6, 1
943 at which time Mill Elementary School became a member of the Whittier City School 
District. In 2007, to reflect a greater influence on the innovative technology integrated into the classrooms, Mill School 
became Mill School and Technology Academy.
 
 
Mill
 
School and Technology Academy (MSTA) is a beautiful school, nestled up against the hills. The small, friendly, 
community atmosphere is immediately apparent: trees, flowers, a tile mural and painted murals surround the school. A 
K
-
5 school, MSTA serves app
roximately 426 students that are known as The Mustangs. About 95% of the students at MSTA 
are of Hispanic/Latino ethnic origin, 4% White (Non
-
Hispanic), an 1% Multiple origins. MSTA is a school
-
wide Title I school, 
with approximately 68.9% of the students 
qualifying for the Free/Reduced Lunch Program. In addition, 16% of the current 
students are identified as English Language Learners (ELLs), 12.1% of the students identified as Reclassified Fluent
-
English
-
Proficient (RFEP), and 8% of students are Students w
ith Disabilities. Every Tuesday, students and staff wear college shirts 

of universities from around the country.
 
 
At Mill School and Tech
nology Academy, the staff, parents, and community work as a team to create an educationally rich 
environment that celebrates diversity, promotes character development, and nurtures a passion for life
-
long learning. 
Academic standards and high expectations 
form the foundation for quality instruction that continues to increase student 
achievement. The expectation is that all of our students will become educated, responsible, productive members of a 
democratic society.
 
 
MSTA has a total of 16 general education
 
classes: two kindergarten, two 1st grade, three 2nd grade, three 3rd grade, three 
4th grade, and three 5th grade classes. All classroom teachers are fully credentialed and are certified to teach English 
Language Learners. Additional support staff includes
 
a 100% Special Education Resource Specialist, a Speech Team (three 
days a week), a Psychologist (one day per week), a School Social Worker (two days per week), a library clerk, a full time 
secretary, an office clerk (three and a half hours per day), a tec
hnology clerk, a community liaison (twenty hours per week), 
and a health clerk (five hours per day). To help us transition to the California State Standards, additional support for 
teachers is available and provided by an Instructional Coach and teacher le
aders in the area of Technology, Curriculum 
and Assessment, Multi

The MSTA staff is committed to providing a high quality instructional program and works diligently to provide equal access 
for all students. Opportunities for students to achieve excellence are provided through a balanced compre
hensive 
program aligned to the California State Standards that includes daily instruction, intervention, and enrichment. All 
students have access to standards aligned instructional materials and there is a process in place for teachers to order 
materials w
hen needed. The MSTA staff is immersed in on site training and engage in regular coaching cycles to develop 
a comprehensive Balanced Literacy program that includes: Reader's and Writer's Workshop, Interactive and Shared 
Reading and Writing, and Word Study.
  
Each of which are differentiated based on data to support individual student needs.  
In addition, MSTA teachers attend district led math trainings to support the implementation of the Eureka Math program. 
Teachers administer benchmark and common formativ
e assessments aligned to the California Assessment of Student 
Progress and Performance (CAASPP) to monitor student progress toward mastering standards. Summer time and release 
time throughout the academic school year is utilized by grade levels to create l
ong range plans, to backwards plan, and 
prepare high quality lessons and opportunities for learning.
 
 
The MSTA staff is committed to being learners! The staff engages in whole staff book clubs to deepen their knowledge 
and understanding of how to best 
support their learners.  In 2017
-
18 the staff read and met monthly to discuss "Teaching 
Reading in Small Groups" by Jennifer Serravallo.  Lab study sessions were designed to practice and implement specific 
practices from the reading into action.  Follow up
 
was conducted through coaching cycles, while Data Reflection Sessions 
allowed teams time to use the data to plan for continuous conferring work.  In addition, with the assistance of the Riordan 
Instructional Innovation Grant, some MSTA teachers were able 
to attend the Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Project's Small Group and Conferring Institute, while others attended Jennifer Serravallo's Reading and Writing Strategies 
Institute.  Both ignited the learning on the campus, bringing more expertise and o
pportunities for the staff to grow from 
within.  This year, MSTA is in it's 2nd year of the Cotsen Art of Teaching (AoT) Foundation's mentorship program.  The 
program provides additional goal oriented staff development opportunities along with weekly coach
ing for each of the 
five participants.  The Cotsen AoT partnership is invaluable, in that, it extends learning opportunities to the entire staff.
  
MSTA teachers have participated in Cotsen AoT Annual Conference, STEAM Ahead Conference, Technology Playgroun
d 
and several Balanced Literacy trainings.  This year, a team will be part of the Cotsen AoT first Integrated Learning Institut
e. 
This four day institute will help the MSTA staff define and develop a vision for integrated learning and a plan for funding 
th
e work that will be implemented in 2019
-
20.
 
 
Central to the mission of MSTA is the effective integration of technology across the curriculum. The Cotsen AoT Integrated 
Learning Institute will assist in layer on the already technology enhanced 
environment that is used to effectively engage 
students. All classrooms are equipped with an Instructional HDTV Monitor, Apple TV and a surround sound system. 
Teachers use their laptop, internet resources, and iPad applications to design their lessons, whi
ch are mirrored using the 
iPad and HDTV with Apple TV. Information and new learning is accessed and displayed in a variety of ways by both teacher 
and students. The Apple TVs allow teachers to be able to immediately display student work as a model for clas
sroom 
discussion, including 3
-
D items as well. Response systems allows students to key in their answer with immediate feedback 
in graph form, giving teachers on
-
the
-
spot assessment of student learning.   Kindergarten, 1st grade and 2nd grade 
students use i
Pads in a 1
-
1 model classroom cart, while 3rd
-
5th grade students have the option to have 24/7 access 
through a check out take home system. Our 1

recognized as an Apple Distinguished School and serves as a model visitation site for school districts wishing to observe in 
a successful technology integration program.

MSTA strives to function as a Professional Learning Community (PLC) and the framework of a PLC drives the collaborative 
work of the staff. Teachers meet weekly to develop their instructional plans to meet the needs of our diverse learners.  
The primary fo
cus of our PLC work is the implementation of the new California State Standards and refining our technology 
integration practices.  School
-

(Substitution, Augmentation
, Modification, Redefinition) model, which encourages educators to move beyond simply 
using technology as a substitute for traditional methodologies and instead using technology to transform the learning 
experiences for students to enhance academic achieve
ment.  Teachers learn together how to best implement the use of 
technology while utilizing best instructional practices.  In addition, our work as a PLC has developed into a systematic 
approach to Response to Intervention (RtI). All students are given Univ
ersal Assessments that provide specific data as to 
their learning needs.  With the support of our Intervention and Assessment Lead Teacher, students are placed in 
appropriate interventions/enrichment classes for thirty minutes four times per week. Formativ
e data is reviewed on a bi
-
weekly basis during Data Reflections Sessions, which include the principal and grade level teams, at regular intervals to 
check in on student progress.
 
 
We believe that reading is essential to the success of our students.  To sup
port our implementation of Reader's Workshop 
and provide our students with a greater array of reading experiences, MSTA uses a web
-
based program called RAZkids, 
the later is sponsored by MSTA's Parent Teacher Corporation (PTC), to encourage students to rea
d appropriately leveled 
texts for comprehension. Students earn points as they successfully read and complete a quiz. MSTA students are 
motivated to achieve their personal reading goals.  Students are also encouraged to read during the summer by 
participati
ng in the Whittier Public Library's Summer Reading Program and MSTA's very own Summer Reading Program 
hosted by the school's library aide.
 
 

-
5. The ST
 
Math program helps students to develop conceptual understandings of mathematical procedures, while developing 
perseverance and problem solving skills.  RAZKids provides online leveled reading materials to assist in ensuring all 
students have books to read
 
at the appropriate levels. These supplemental program provides teachers with another data 
point to track the progress of our learners.  Both programs allow for individualized instructional support.
 
 
MSTA provides a variety of school programs to enhance a 
positive learning environment and sense of school community. 
This is the fourth year of the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) implementation, led by the PBIS 
Leadership Team which is made up of both teaching and classified staff.  The goa
l of PBIS is to create a positive 

Mustang tickets provide the principal, teachers and support staff a tangible way for recognizing positive be
havior choices.  
Weekly and monthly raffles and a menu of choices for redeeming tickets help keep positive behavior at the forefront.  We 
recognize that students need continuous support in developing as individuals.  Social Emotional Learning is integrated
 
into 
our Tier I PBIS Practices, 2nd Step Social Emotional program and Mindfulness practices, assist students in learning self 
monitoring and self regulatory practices. The MSTA staff regularly studies the 8 Best Classroom practices. The PBIS Tier II 
team,
 
which includes the School Social Worker, uses data to make decisions to provide additional supports to students 
that may need more time to learn behaviors, more frequent feedback or social
-
emotional support. MSTA is proud to be 
recognized by the Californi
a PBIS Coalition as a GOLD Level School for its successful implementation of PBIS!
 
 
The perfect attendance award celebrates students for being present at school every day. Monthly and Trimester awards 
acknowledge students for good citizenship and academic 
success. In addition, MSTA prides itself for offering a variety of 
enrichment programs such as Mad Science, Moving Mindz STEM Enrichment, Chorus, Coding Club, Run Club, Drama and 
Art after school programs that are wonderful opportunities for enrichment.  R
each for the Stars, a separate program, 
offers  after school care during which time students have a snack and play time before they do homework and participate 
in enrichment activities such as music, choir, art, dance, and sports.
 
 
We strongly believe that
 
the Visual and Performing Arts are an important component of a child's education. All students 
grade K
-
5 are provided with bi
-
weekly instruction in art and physical educational, while 3rd
-
5th grade receive bi
-
weekly 
instruction in music. MSTA hosts two sc
hool
-
wide musical performances for its families, one in December and another in 
May.

Parents are actively involved in our Parent Teacher Corporation (PTC), School Site Council (SSC) and English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC). The PTC hosts several fam
ily activities that are enthusiastically supported throughout the 
year, building a strong family community at MSTA.  Parents are continually finding new ways to support MSTA and its 
families. We are very thankful that the ELAC group and others are well att
ended and continue to grow. A Community 
Liaison works 4 hours a day to assist with communication, coordinate needed assistance and publicize our parent activities.
 
 
MSTA's Student Council plans monthly school spirit activities. The Student Council also pro
vides opportunities for 
volunteerism and charity work to support needy families within our community.  Students host a Canned Food and Toy 
Drive during the holiday season and raise funds to support American Heart Associations Jump Rope for Heart event ever
y 
February.
 
 
Mill School and Technology Academy is a home away from home for 426 students. Our parents trust us with the 
responsibility to educate each child to achieve grade level standards. Our educational program encourages the 
development of good citiz
enship, personal responsibility, self
-
respect and the respect of others. We will continue to build 
a strong academic program, to raise student achievement, and to actively involve our school community in the ongoing 
process of improvement.

supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curricu
lum, which includes 


 
Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common
 
Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy 
skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell w
ere purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there 
is 
a process to order additional materials througho
ut the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our schoo
l complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provi
de supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full
 
implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 
recomm

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
It is a high priority at Mill School and Technology Academy (MSTA) to welcome and to encourage parents to visit, volunteer, 
attend parent education sessions, and participate in decision
-
making meetings. All notices for parent meetings are sent 
home in Span
ish and English. Parents are involved as partners seeing that their children have good attendance, get to 
school on time, and complete all homework in a timely manner. We are fortunate to have strong community support 
through the Parent Teacher Corporation
 
(PTC), School Site Council, ELAC and active parent involvement in the classroom. 
PTC fundraisers provide additional funds for programs that support instruction as well as school
-
wide community events.  
Yearly, parents spend hundreds of hours assisting on 
our campus. The addition of a Community Liaison  provides 
opportunity to reach out and make personal phone calls for school
-
wide events. Area businesses support the school by 
providing donations for technology, library books, certificates for student recog
nition, and school enhancement projects.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mill School and Technology Academy (MSTA) is committed to the safety and security of each student. The School Safety 
Plan is reviewed and revised annually. To maintain these conditions which contribute to the best possible learning 
environment, the School 
Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: MSTA provides compiled school crime information each month for the California Safe 
School Assessment as mandated by the State of California. This information is analyzed at each school 
site to 
determine what steps may be taken to reduce incidents of crime.
 
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected 
child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Departmen
t of Social Services to determine if any 
follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
 
3.
 
Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of student and school personnel, the school safety committee 
has created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan. 
Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated 
for effectiveness.
 
 
4.
 
School Discipline: MSTA has implemented a school
-
wide Behavior Matrix as part of the Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) implementation.  This communicates the high st
andards and expectations  that 
all are accountable for their behavior. This is reviewed in student assemblies or classroom presentations. Staff 
members consistently enforce the school
-
wide expectations.
 
 
5.
 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: I
f a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at 
school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authorities, the teacher(s) of 
the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student.

6.
 
Sexual Harassment P
olicy: MSTA strictly adheres to district policies which prohibit sexual harassment or 
discrimination of any kind. The sexual harassment policy is distributed to each student at the beginning of the 
school year, and employees are advised of their duty to ta
ke prompt action if they become aware of any incidents 
of sexual harassment.
 
 
7.
 
Schoolwide Dress Code: MSTA believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive school 
environment. Parents support a school uniform policy. The primary standard
s for student dress and grooming 
include that the student should be neat and clean at school; the student should not wear clothing that 
compromises safety or modesty or is disruptive to the educational process.
 
 
8.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: MSTA believes 
a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a positive 
learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and maintaining a safe 
and orderly environment. Teachers, administrator, campus supervisors and p
arent volunteers supervise and 
interact with students to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
