By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES & SAFETY
 
Maple Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through 
proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. Original school facilities were built in 1983; ongoing maintenance and modernization projects ensure facilities 
remain safe and up
-
to
-
date as well as provide adequate space for students and staff. Throu
ghout the years, portable 
classrooms have been added to the campus to accommodate growth in enrollment. The campus is comprised of the 
following:
 
Acreage = 10
 
Square Footage = 39,929
 
Number of Permanent Classrooms = 22
 
Number of Portable Classrooms = 22
 
Nu
mber of Restrooms (student use) = 2 sets
 
Health Office = 1
 
Staff Lounge = 1
 
Staff Workroom = 1
 
 
CAMPUS SUPERVISION and MAINTENANCE
 
One proctor supervises the crosswalks and helps students safely cross the street before and after school. Each morning 
before
 
school starts, proctors supervise students as they enter school grounds. During recess, teachers and a proctor are 
on the upper and lower playgrounds to monitor behavior and playground activities. During lunch, proctors monitor both 
quad area (cafeteria) 
and playground activities. At the end of the day, teachers escort students to on
-
campus after
-
school 
programs, the bus loading area,  student pickup areas, and to the buses to ensure students leave campus safely.  The 
custodial staff and district's mainten
ance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. The principal and custodians 
communicate daily regarding maintenance issues and special
 
projects; hand
-
held walkie talkies enhance two
-
way 
communication efforts and help facilitate an immediate response to emergency situations.
 
 
One full
-
time custodian, one full
-
time evening custodian, and one part
-
time evening custodian are assigned to Mapl
e 
Elementary and work closely with the assistant principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special day 
custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students and staff entering
 
school
 
grounds. As part of the daily schedule, the day custodian is responsible for cleaning the cafeteria when students 
are finished with breakfast and lunch. The restrooms are checked regularly during the day by the custodian. The evening 
custodians clean clas
srooms, desks, school offices, and restrooms, and are responsible for set up and take down of 
equipment and/or furniture for afternoon and evening events. The principal and assistant principal communicate daily 
with custodial staff to address maintenance n
eeds, safety issues, and cleaning practices.
 
 
Maple Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance & Operations department (M&O) for larger projects, 
routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order proces
s that enables Maple 
Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The district participates 
in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis,
 
to 
assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, 
this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
system
s.
 
 
Planned or recently completed facilities improvements:
 
Repair flooring in portable restrooms
 
Fire alarm testing
 
Paint exterior of school (completed in July 2018)
 
Roof Repair (completed July 2018)
 
Repave blacktop areas and parking lot

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education 
population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a
re aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisf
y the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks and are research
-
based.
 
 
The 
Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the district 
and school site.  Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities based upon a 
comprehensive needs a
ssessment, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas. Supplemental training 
involving curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of reading/language arts, science, social 
studies and math were provided at site
 
request via District and Site Coaches as well as through attendance at academic 
conferences.
 
 
Supplemental training topics are determined by the principal, assistant principal, and Leadership team based upon a 
comprehensive needs assessment. Training prog
rams and topics were chosen based upon the comprehensive needs 
assessment, school focus, and student needs. Results from the California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress (CAASPP), English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC)
 
and district and school
-
wide 
assessments, teacher feedback, classroom assessments, and findings from classroom observations help identify areas for 
improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based 
education fostering student success and proficiency.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of Literacy through the 4Cs and Innova
tion. Supplemental professional development 
is offered throughout the school year on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff 
development topics and focus areas are identified and selected based upon a comprehensive needs 
assessment, input 
from the site leadership team, Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results.
