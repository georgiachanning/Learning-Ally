School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lincoln Elementary School is located in North Redondo Beach and has been serving the community since 1947. It takes 
pride in a strongly
-
knit community with high parent involvement and whole child benefit. The school serves an enroll
ment 
of 660 students kindergarten through fifth grade.
 
 
Lincoln aims to provide all students with an excellent education so that they feel empowered to develop their potential, 
become lifelong learners, and responsible citizens. To do so, Lincoln is staffe
d by talented and dedicated educators who 
strive to meet the needs of all learners. The school maintains a partnership with Beach Cities Health District as part of the
 
LiveWell Kids Program and supports students in opportunities like nutrition lessons in t
he school garden. Additionally, 
students participate in visual and performing arts such as vocal music, instrumental band, and art. Lincoln encourages its 
students to be well
-
rounded while also prioritizing achievement in core subjects, particularly readin
g, writing, and math.
 
 
The staff works as a team to create an environment where mutual respect informs and promotes healthy collaboration as 
well as individual thinking. Our goal is to help our community see the value of learning from one another as we all
 
share 
the common goal of contributing to a better tomorrow. We value tenacity,  perseverance, being open
-
minded and we 
focus on teaching students how to make connections between what they study in school and the challenges they will 
encounter in the real 
world. This learning extends beyond the pages of a textbook. Beginning in the primary grades, the 
teachers reinforce scholarly habits to empower students: they give them the tools to solve problems successfully and think 
independently.
 
 
Our mission is to p
artner with the students and parents and commit to creating responsible citizens and inspire students 
to become lifelong learners and problems solvers in a caring, supportive and diverse environment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The Redondo Beach Unified School District is focusing staff professional development (PD) in three main areas: effective 
instructional strategies 
aligned to California State Standards at schools sites; use of technology in instruction; and the 
supporting of the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of all students, particularly through the implementation of 
Positive Behavioral Intervention and Sup
ports (PBIS) in all schools. While the current PD does focus on instructional and 
curriculum in mathematics, English, and science, the RBUSD is also developing PD for History Social Science standards.
 
The RBUSD is engaged in a multi
-
layered approach to del
ivering PD. The District provides PD through: teacher release 
time; conference attendance; one
-
day workshops; mentoring; book studies; and after
-

elementary schools utilize weekly collaborative planning time through the impleme
ntation of a School Instructional 
Leadership Team and grade level leads.
 
Targeted teacher development activities are essential for increasing the quality of education to students. The below topics 
are a few of the professional development areas for this sc
hool year:
 

 
Reading strategies and understanding text complexity
 

 
MTSS and Tier 2 Intervention Strategies
 

 
Supporting students with disabilities through inclusive practices and co
-
teaching
 

 
Grade level articulation
 

 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 

 
Stud
ent mental health
 

 
Suicide prevention
 

 
Mastery Learning
 

 
Examination of student assessment results
 
The use of student data is critical to better assess and support individual student development. The District provides 
training on our student data management, 
Performance Matters, to analyze individual and aggregate student progress. 
Elementary teachers and secondary math teachers receive ongoing training and support on diagnosing students learning 
targets and adjusting instruction to increase number sense.

Internal PD offerings are supplemented by partnering with external professional development organizations, including 

teachers and administration
 
on instructional programs for all students.
 
 
Our new teachers are supported at school sites and at the District level through the Beginning Teacher Support and 
Assessments (BTSA) Program where each new teacher is mentored by a BTSA support provider. By wo
rking with BTSA, a 
new teacher receives support and resources to improve their teaching pedagogy.
 
 
Through the collective bargaining process, additional paid professional development days are included in the teacher work 
calendar.
