Elementary School Mission/Vision Statement
 
W
here Everyone Belongs...
 
Del Rey Elementary School inspires students to be life
-
long learners, independent and expressive 

rentiated 
curriculum, students benefit from opportunities to be creative and to build confidence while 
participating in a challenging program of study in a safe and nurturing environment. We foster a 
culture of support and mutual respect within the communi
ty of teachers, administrators, students, 
and families.
 
 
Description:
 
Del Rey School rests nestled in a neighborhood just east of the Caldecott tunnel, in Orinda, CA.  We 
are one of four elementary schools in Orinda. We serve transitional kindergarten thro
ugh 5th
-
grade 
students, with a population of 430 this current school year.
 
 
Our school site has an incredible setting, with two creeks bordering the campus, beautiful mature 
oak trees, a natural habitats garden, and views of the hills. Built in 1953 and ma
intaining the original 
footprint, the school has recently expanded, adding four new Gen7 classrooms. Our campus 
includes 21 full
-
sized classrooms, a STEAM lab, MakerSpace, science lab, multipurpose room, 
library, and music room. We have a dynamic community
, and it is the people, including teachers, 
parents, support staff, students, and the greater community, working together to do what is best 
for all students that shines here.
 
 
A California Distinguished School in 2014 and a National Blue Ribbon School in 
2015, a California 
Gold Ribbon School in 2016, and California Distinguished School again in 2018. We are very proud 
of our educational program. From an educational perspective, we are a team that uses both 
formative and summative data across all subject ar
eas to drive instruction and to make the 
curriculum accessible to all of our students. We accomplish this with the support of the school 
district and the greater community. We have a weekly collaboration time of one hour for teachers 
to work and plan toget
her. Additionally, we have three days set aside where we analyze data and 
use it to plan grouping strategies, adjust curriculum pacing, and develop enrichment and 
intervention experiences. We have a Literacy and Technology Coach who drive the planning, wor
k 
with educators in a modeling and coaching role, and facilitate cohesion across the school and 
district. We believe in professional development, and provide ongoing training for our teachers that 
aligns with district and site goals. Research supports the 
idea that the one most significant factor in 
raising academic achievement is the expertise of the teacher. We live by this and work to build 
teacher expertise on an ongoing basis.
 
 
Del Rey School has carefully implemented a technology plan that supports st
udent learning and 
increases community communication. We have over 160 computers on campus and have 
implemented a one
-
to
-
one model in our 4th and 5th grades. Our plan has a replacement guideline 
so that we cycle out the older units for more current ones. O
ur classroom technology includes 
document cameras, projectors, laptops, iPads and a SMART Board in every class. This has created 
a new world of educational opportunities for our students! Our technology has also enabled us to 
administer state
-
mandated test
ing in a timely and smooth manner. Additionally, our educators 
have access to pertinent data that we use to inform instruction. Most recently we have added a 
MakerSpace and STEAM Lab to our school, fostering creativity and critical thinking as we embrace 
N
GSS.

If you were to visit our school you would see quality instructional practices in classrooms. And then you would see the ways 
in which we 
go beyond. Our parents are an important component of our success. We work toward bringing them into the fold, val
uing their input and 
talents, and utilizing their skills. For example, it is with parent expertise that we run our annual fund, our school kitchen
 
and our before 
and after school care. Del Rey has a quality enrichment program, including Spanish, music, dan
ce, drama, chess, art, yoga, poetry, amongst 
others completely organized by parent volunteers. Our website provides weekly communications supported by parent volunteers. 
Our 
parents donate their time and energy to both volunteer at school and outside schoo
l to maximize our potential. They raise a significant 
amount of money that is then channeled through our Parents' Club and School Site Council to support the important curriculum 
and 
professional development goals. Our community values smaller class sizes 
and has rallied to maintain the 20 to 1 ratio in the lower grades. 
Additionally, the entire Orinda community is invited to participate in the Education Foundation of Orinda ensuring that all s
tudents have 
access to art and music programs. Through working t
ogether and maintaining high expectations we continue to thrive. We search out 
partnerships in the greater community.  The Rotary Club funds grants and sponsors district events like the annual Rotary Fiel
d Day. Our 
local businesses contribute to education 
by hosting city festivals, restaurant events, and so much more.
 
 
Our students take pride in their school and we help them learn to connect to their community. We have a school
-
wide thematic book 
program we call "School
-
Wide Read
-
Aloud".  Through this progr
am we highlight character education, tying to our Second Step curriculum. 
Additionally, we work with KidPower and Caring School Communities to embrace Social and Emotional Learning.  We have a commun
ity 
outreach program, where students take part in being a
ctive community members. We invite our neighbors to our Fall Festival and to long
-
standing traditional performances.
 
 
In conclusion, we are an inclusive community that listens to each other respectfully, communicates effectively, and values th
e bonds we 
work hard to create. Everyone is encouraged to be involved, and there are so many different ways to play a part. We work towa
rd bringing 
people into the fold. While we are competitive in terms of our performance, we are collaborative, hardworking, and mode
st in our day
-
to
-
day operations. We are about people and what is best for all students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Orinda Union School District (OUSD) convenes textbook committees to help in the selection process. The textbook committees co
nsist of teachers and 
administrators in the Dis
trict. State
-
approved books are reviewed, piloted, and a selection is made based upon pre
-
determined criteria. The books go on 
public display for two weeks and are then presented to the Governing Board for adoption. The district has affirmed that class
 
set
s or electronic versions 
of textbooks are available to all students, including English learners.
 
 
At the middle school level, class sets or electronic versions are also purchased to eliminate the need of students carrying h
eavy books. Books have been 
purch
ased for all core academic areas as well as visual and performing arts, and music, at all grade levels. Textbooks are Califor
nia Department of 
Education
-
approved and California Standards
-
based.
 
 
A public hearing is held each October and reports are made qu
arterly to the Governing Board to meet all requirements according to the Williams 
Settlement Agreement.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

Our school takes pride in the active parent involvement that is ever present within our school and district. Our parents prov
ide tremendous volunteer 
and economic support. The School Site Coordin
ating Council has 12 members who represent the staff and parent community, and who coordinate and 
approve our annual Site Plan and budget. Many parents also volunteer to work in the classroom. The Parents Club helps with ou
r emergency preparedness 
program,
 
before and after school programs, enrichment classes, cultural events, health and safety training, library, math in the garde
n, special events, 
hot lunch program, our Think First Character Education program and much more. Del Rey parents also provide inpu

School Safety Plan
 
At Del Rey School, maintaining a safe and orderly environm

recess. Student crossing guards help during drop
-
off and pickup. Students arriving before 7:45 a.m. or staying after school must report to our before and 
after 
school program. Visitors must sign in at the office and wear identification badges. We revise our Safety Plan annually and re
plenish safety supplies 
annually.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty and staff i
n March 2019. We maintain emergency supplies, hold 
monthly emergency drills, and hold an earthquake/disaster drill each year. Our Parent Club supports our efforts by purchasing
 
and updating the 
emergency supplies stored in our emergency container and in cl
assrooms. Our School Safety Plan addresses the physical, social, and emotional safety of 
all members of our community, and is reviewed annually by the staff and School Site Coordinating Council. It is available for
 
review in the office.
