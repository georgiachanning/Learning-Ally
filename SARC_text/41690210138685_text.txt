Principal's Message
 
 
Welcome to Mariposa Upper Elementary School! Our team of teachers, staff, parents and 
administration have worked hard to create a wonderful
 
learning experience that highlights the 
SCSD Habits of Mind for 21st Century Learners (Ownership, Communication, Collaboration, 
Creativity, Critical Thinking and Citizenship/Stewardship) and deeper learning through PBL (Project 
Based Learning). We have de
signed a school that will encourage and support risk taking, ownership 
and leadership, while fostering intrinsic motivation to learn and discover the world around us. We 
have also developed ways to extend the learning beyond the classroom walls through str
ong 
elective and enrichment programs including music, art, maker space, and digital citizenship, along 
with robust after school offerings and flexible learning environments to best meet all of our 
students' needs. We encourage student leadership through ou
r Monarch Council, student
-
led clubs 
and ambassador program. 
 
 
Alexandra Friel, Principal
 
 
Mariposa Upper Elementary School Mission Statement
 
 
The mission of Mariposa is to inspire our 21st Century learners to achieve their highest
 
academic, 
social, emotio
nal, intellectual and physical potential, while developing a strong
 
sense of character, 
community, and stewardship. We aspire to amplify each child's natural
 
curiosity and love of 
learning so they can become caring and enthusiastic lifelong learners.

We believe:
 

 
Project Ba
sed Learning (PBL) experiences, developed from Common Core State
 
Standards (CCSS), promote learning through 
authentic experiences that encourage
 
critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and social responsibility.
 

 
Personalized learning, 
designed to adapt to student learning styles and academic
 
needs, can ignite student passions while leading 
to targeted student growth and
 

 

 
Small teams of 4th and 5th grade classes cultivate a safe environment for 
individual
 
learning and self
-
discovery, while also 
building a deep sense of belonging.
 

 
High expectations for character and behavior create a school culture exemplified by
 
physical and emotional safety, integrity, 
compassion, and respect.
 

 
Shared school trad
itions and celebrations support personal growth, collaboration, and
 
a strong sense of school community.
 

 
Multiple means of assessment, including portfolios and student
-
led conferences,
 
along with academic reports, hold students 
accountable for the highest q
uality of
 
work.
 

 
Physical fitness, outdoor activities, and visual and performing arts are an integral part
 

 
 
Across the school day our students will:
 

 
strengthen their collaboration skills
 

 
take personal risks (that do not endanger a
nyone)
 

 
participate in a variety of activities and projects
 

 
learn to communicate effectively and resolve conflicts peacefully
 

 
strengthen their questioning, conversation and argumentation skills
 

 
share their findings in evidence
-
based ways
 

 
deepen their unders
tanding of what it takes to become well
-
rounded citizens and stewards of our environment
 

 
listen to and speaks kindly to others
 

 
look for ways to include and help others
 

 
celebrate differences
 

 
work toward their personal best, socially and 
academically
 
 
We welcome you to visit our school. It is a special space because of the strong teaching staff, supportive parent community a
nd engaged 
student body.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

San Carlos School District holds a public hearing annually determine that each sc
hool within the district has sufficient and good quality textbooks. 
instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All stu
dents, including English learners, 
are given their own individu
al instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials 
are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education and in alignment with the development of
 
State
 
Standards and 
Frameworks, making the textbooks and materials used in the school the most currently available. As part of the adoption proce
ss, materials are piloted 
and selected by a selection committee composed primarily of teachers and including other s
taff as necessary. When materials are being recommended 
for adoption, they are made available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption and/or parents are invi
ted to provide input via other 
means. Recommendations from the committee ar
e then brought to the Board for adoption.

Parent/Community Engagement
 
 
One of Mariposa's goals is to make school inextricably connected to community. To
 
accomplish this, we need parents/guardians and other community 
members to become
 
actively involved in our 
school. Our programs rely on the assistance, participation, and ideas
 
of our entire school community. 
Depending on your availability, skills, talents, and interests,
 
there are many ways to support our learning community:
 

 
Administrative: data entry, copying
/printing/gathering/making instructional
 
materials
 

 
Classroom: tutoring, reading groups, math centers, activity centers
 

 
Fieldwork: driving, chaperoning, preparing(making calls, gathering materials)
 

 

study/interest (local issues, content
 
knowledge, craft skills, etc.) at school
 

 
PTA (Parent Teacher Association): getting involved and helping with events,
 
fundraising, communication and more
 

 
School Site Council (SSC) Participating on the SSC to help 
identify and monitor goals for the school.
 

 
Library: organizing materials, re
-
shelving books, supporting library time
 

 
School Day: yard duty/supervision, caring for garden plants, organizing
 
materials/play equipment, supporting hot lunch program
 

 
Maker Space:
 

 

 
Helping to supervise and support our student
-
led clubs
 

 
Garden: Teaching a monthly gardening lesson or assisting in the garden.
 

 
Art in Action: Facilitating a monthly art lesson or assisting with the les
son
 
 
Parents also provide critical support for essential district program such as the DELAC (District English Language Advisory Co
mmittee), the SEDAC (Special 
Education District Advisory Committee) as well as by participating in SCEF (San Carlos Education 
Foundation). We are very fortunate to have such active 
and supportive parents!

School Safety Plan
 
School Safety Plan:
 
Safety of students is a primary concern of Mariposa Upper Elementary School. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules
, and regulations pertaining 
to hazardous mate
rials and state earthquake standards.  The School Site Safety Plan is reviewed and updated each August, based on the feedback
 
of the 
school staff and site council. Our Safety Plan is aligned to the Big Five guidelines from the County. All revisions are com
municated to all members of the 
Arroyo School staff including the certificated and classified staff.  The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps 
for ensuring student and staff 
safety during a disaster. Big Five drills are conducted on a monthly
 
basis throughout the year and are coordinated with Tierra Linda Middle School, the 
other school that is co
-
located on the same campus. Staff are trained annually on the Big Five Protocols with ongoing check
-
ins before and after each 
drill.  Safety plans a
re communicated with parents through principal's memos in our weekly newsletter.  Students are supervised by staff before sch
ool, 
during lunch and recess and after school. Once school begins, the gates are locked and all visitors must check in at the offi
c
e to be on campus.  There are 
also designated and well supervised areas for student drop off and pick up on the campus.

administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The district offers two full
-

with each other, during the
ir collaborative prep and meeting time. This year, we continued coaching and collaboration sessions for teachers during the 
school day. In addition to opportunities through the district, site "Flex Funds"  as well as other targeted budgets are used 
to prov
