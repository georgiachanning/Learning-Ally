School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with 
data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members
 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates,
 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
December 2019
 
 
As the standards for California have changed from the California state standards to the Common Cor
e standards in ELA 
and Mathematics and the science standards have moved to the Next Generation Science Standards, textbooks and 
instructional materials have been purchased that align with the new set of grade level expectations.  In some curricular 
areas, 
the District has moved cautiously before formally adopting textbooks as publishers continue to revise their 
materials to better align them with the Common Core.  At Oak Grove, new mathematics textbooks were adopted in 
preparation for the 2016
-
17 school yea
r.  Materials are being piloted for English Language Arts are in process of review 
and piloting for adoption February 2019.  NGSS curriculum is being piloted during the 2019
-
20 school year and will be 
approved for the 2020
-
21 school year.
 
 
The Oak Grove Un
ion School District has an established curriculum committee to review the process by which materials 
are introduced, piloted and adopted.  All new textbooks must go through the council prior to beginning the review/pilot 
process.

includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Oak Grove 
Union Elementary School District has a robust and active parent community. Oak Grove School provides families 
with many opportunities to get involved in school programs and related activities. Teachers encourage parental 
involvement in school activities, e
xtra
-
curricular events, field trips and event days held at the schools.
 
 
In addition, there are opportunities for parents to become involved through School Site Council, the English Language 
Advisory Committee, the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Pare
nt Advisory Committee, the Oak
 
Grove Education Partners (OGEP) and other support organizations.
 
 
Parents receive regular communication from the school and the district through the use of emails, automated phone calls 
and notices home. In addition, the pare
nt community is informed of school and district activities
 
through the use of district managed social media accounts and school and district websites.
 
 
The mission of the District's parent organization, OGEP, is to provide financial support for educational
 
activities for the 
students of the Oak Grove Union School District in the areas of academic excellence, engagement with the arts, 
development of life skills, celebration of diversity, and stewardship of the environment, and to contribute to the efforts 
wh
ich help strengthen the sense of community at both the school and the district levels.

Parents are also involved with overseeing the schools programs through involvement in their site councils. School site 
councils seek to gain parent involvement in order
 
to help determine student needs, gather input and shape programs. Site 
Councils are responsible for allocating site funds in support of student needs through reviewing teacher requests aligned 
to their educational goals.
 
 
Parents of English Language learn
ers at both sites are involved in their English Language Learner committees and the 
District English Language Learner committee in order to support and engage in programs that lead to their students 
understanding of the English Language and engagement in s
chool while preparing them for their future.
 
 
Parents are involved in the Gifted and Talented Program that seek to challenge and engage students on a daily basis and 
through extended learning opportunities.
 
 
Informally parents engage in the Oak Grove Schoo
l District through helping in fundraisers, class event days, chaperoning 
field trips, helping in the classroom and more.
 
 
The Oak Grove Union School District welcomes parent involvement and appreciates the support of all of our community.
