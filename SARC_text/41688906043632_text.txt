School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and 
members of our caring community donate hundreds of hours and generate thousands of dollars to ensure 
we provide our students with many outstanding programs over and above the basic curriculum provided by the state. Art, 
music, physical education, and a sci
ence teacher program are not fully funded by the district, state or federal government, 
but cost the school over $100,000 a year. This community considers these programs and staff a priority invaluable to our 
students and continues to fund them each year. 
Parent and community donations of time and money allow these 


ion through English Learner Advisory Committee 
(ELAC) and the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), which depend upon our families and communities in order to increase 
our capacity to serve our students. There are a number of events that bring parents, commun
ity members and staff 
together and create a sense of community, such as Continent Day, Oceans Week, Literature Club Garage Sales, Holiday 
Bazaar, and Talent Show.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As of January 2020, the school safety plan is in the process of being reviewed and updated to reflect any changes to the 
safety plan. It will be posted to the school website (https://faralloneview.cabrillo.k12.ca.
us/) once approved by the School 
Site Council (SSC). Key elements of the plan include procedures during emergency situations such as environmental 
hazard, campus safety, fire, earthquake, and evacuation off
-
site in the event of an emergency.  We have updat
ed staff 
assignments for every situation, conducted an inventory of supplies and services. We have Epipens and an automated 
external defibrillator AED on site for emergency use.  Our staff have been trained on basic emergency protocols (choking, 
allergic r
eactions, the use of the AED and other basic emergency situations). We have also tested our emergency 
communication channels, including radio, email, text, and voice calls.
