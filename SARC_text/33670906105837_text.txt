School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of st
udents. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compl
iance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The 
final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks che
cked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment fo
r grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the fir
st day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The safety, 
cleanliness, and adequacy of our school facilities are a high priority to the District. Overall, school grounds and 
facilities are in good repair. The District's Deferred Maintenance Plan is assessed and updated every year. Work generated 
by the Deferred M
aintenance Plan is generally completed during the summer months. Fire inspections are conducted on 
an annual basis and any issues are addressed immediately. The District also has an internal inspection team conducting 
annual safety inspections of all sites
. All safety
-
related items are handled as top priority.
 
 
Our school overall appearance is good and maintenance does an excellent job at maintaining the facilities.  Work orders 
are submitted online and are addressed promptly by the maintenance department.

The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council 
(SSC) meets a minimum of 6 times a year. The SSC collaborates with teachers and school 
administration to examine program effectiveness, school safety, and learning opportunities. The PTA has fund
-
raising 
activities for field trips, supplies and equipment, 
assemblies, and incentives for students. They provide school
-
wide 
activities for students and families, including Book Fairs, fall and spring pictures, Red Ribbon Week, Fall Carnival and othe
r 
family nights, various assemblies, and our traditional Young Au
thors' Day. An English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
advises the SSC, principal, and staff on a number of issues related to the education of English Language Learners. Parents 
volunteer in various capacities throughout the school. We will continue to e
ncourage parental participation through PTA 
activities, classroom volunteer opportunities, School Site Council, and English Language Advisory Committee. We strive 
for 100% attendance at our annual Parent/Teacher Conferences so that parents and teachers can
 
work jointly toward the 
goal of student success.  Indian Hills Elementary School works with the Director of Parent Involvement to ensure parent 
participation in wellness programs, ESL programs, and nutritional programs.
 
 
Parents are kept informed on what 
is happening at our school through flyers, Peachjar, Q Communication, Facebook,
