By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Camino Grove School is a community where the people make a difference. We strive to provide all of our students with a 
rigorous education program. Our high
-
quality instructional program is designed to meet the diverse acad
emic and social 
needs of our students in a dynamic learning environment that will better prepare them to master the California Academic 
State Standards and maximize their ability to be college and career ready. Our staff is highly trained and dedicated to 
making a difference in the lives of our students. At Camino Grove, we are committed to the idea that learning is the shared 
responsibility of faculty, students, families, and the community. Teachers collaborate weekly and work in teams during 
early
-
release
 
Wednesdays to promote achievement and provide challenging experiences for all students. As well, teachers 
meet seven times per year in vertical collaborative teams, TK
-

development training, and l
earning walks to acquire new strategies to meet the diverse needs of students.
 
 
At Camino Grove students see each other in a positive light as they exhibit leadership, personal responsibility, and respect 
for self and others. Camino Grove is a "Leader in M
e" school and uses "Restorative Practices" as a means to develop 
character, leadership skills, and resolve conflicts. We take pride in the high degree of parent involvement at Camino Grove 
Elementary School. Our parents provide leadership through participa
tion on the School Site Council, English Language 
Advisory Committee, and Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Parents can be seen throughout the day volunteering in 
classrooms, working in the copy center, assisting with student drop off and pick up and assis
ting with lessons in our Art 
Program. Modernization and construction was completed in August 2013. Each classroom has been updated with new 
technology, including smart boards, document cameras, and projectors. In September 2016, Camino Grove implemented

The Multipurpose Room also received new lighting and an upgraded sound system. The main office building was renovated 
and new landscaping was
 
added throughout the campus. Security gates and blinds were installed around the campus to 
provide greater safety for students, and the school is equipped with security cameras and a secured entry system.
 
 
At Camino Grove Elementary School we believe all 
students are filled with great potential and leadership. We are 
committed to helping students discover their voice and strengths by providing diverse learning opportunities through the 
implementation of Universal Design for Learning, innovative teaching pr
actices, and personalized learning experiences.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Camino Grove Elementary School was built in 1953 and provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and 
volunteers. The district administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and facili
ties are well 
maintained. All schools in the Arcadia Unified School District were completely modernized in 1995

1996. As a result of 
Measure I passing by strong voter response in November 2006, Camino Grove underwent major renovations which began 
in the su
mmer of 2011. This project was completed in August of 2013. The renovations included cutting
-
edge technology 
in each classroom to enhance interactive instruction and learning, a new student
-
services building, air conditioning in the 
multipurpose room, and 
upgraded restrooms, electrical, plumbing, and drainage. Camino Grove Elementary School 
campus currently has 34 classrooms, a staff room, a library/multimedia center, a multipurpose room, and two 
playgrounds. At the time of this publication, 100 percent of

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety 
and Disaster Committee, which consists of classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The committee sets goals for the 
school to conti
nually improve in 3 areas: School Climate (Students, Parents, and Programs), Emergency Preparedness 
(Disasters and Crisis), and School Environment (Facilities and Campus). The plan addresses various safety issues, including 
creating procedures that detect 
and prevent bullying, ensuring appropriate campus supervision, maintaining disaster kits, 
and monitoring emergency procedures. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated each year and approved by the 
School Site Council and the Board of Education.  Th
e plan is reviewed with all staff members at the beginning of each 
school year. Safety drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held four times a
 
year, and intruder/lockdown drills are held at least once a yea
r. Staff members also receive disaster training on a regular 
basis.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers, administrators, and school proctors supervise students on campus before and after 
school, and during breaks and lunch. Camino Grove Elementary School h
as a closed campus, and permission is always 

office and must wear the proper identification badge at all times.

Under the current Local Control Funding Formula, districts like Arcadia Unified School District, with low numbers of 
unduplicated students receive far less ongoing money to implement the California Academic Standards compared to 
neighboring districts with 

youth).  These high unduplicated count districts  received supplemental and concentration grant monies to purchase 
materials, hire consultants, and pay for hour
s of professional development for their instructional and student support 
staffs.
 
 
In the Fall of 2013, the Arcadia Unified School District negotiated an interest
-
based solution for California Academic 
Standards implementation with its bargaining units to 
add three days to the school calendar for two years starting in the 
2014
-
15 school year. Negotiations produced an agreement to spread the three days of additional paid time over seven 
early release days with development time of 2.5 hours per day built into
 
the schedule.  Since 2015, AUSD leadership has 
negotiated annual agreements with its bargaining units to continue the additional three days for professional 
development.
 
 

led the Collaboration Time Advisory 
Council (C
-
TAC) with the task of putting legs to the plan. C
-
TAC is a representative group made up of bargaining unit 
members and management team members who were charged with serving as an advisory committee to the Dist
rict in the 
implementation of the district
-
wide California Academic Standards Collaboration Time supporting TK
-
12 instructional 
programs both vertically and horizontally, as they made dramatic instructional and curricular shifts.
 
 
The commitment from both 
our bargaining units and management was to build research
-
based professional development 
around small collaborative working groups. Each group would be designed intentionally to have a vertical alignment of 
teachers from TK
-
12 engaged in the work together.
 
 
In late Spring of 2014, the C
-
TAC committee reached out to all certificated staff to assist with generating ideas for the 
content of the Collaboration Days. The committee, after reviewing and discussing the many ideas that were submitted 
and looking at s
urvey data, generated a list of themes which became the foundation of the Collaboration Days and assisted 
in guiding the development of a Course Group Catalogue. The planning of the Collaboration Days was research based, 
focused on meaningful work, teacher
 
choice, flexibility, and ongoing commitment. The Professional Development was 
designed around teacher interests that included creating autonomous choice for teachers and support providers in 
relation to where they felt they could best contribute their tra
ining, talents, interests, and education, by participating in 
Small Working Groups (SWaG) and engaging with other professionals to continue the real work of implementing the 
California Academic Standards.  C
-
TAC continues to act as the advisory body for th
e Collaboration Days, reviewing survey 
data and requests for course offerings, and considering suggestions for improvements to the program.
 
 
Each SWaG is led by a self
-
selected Facilitator from amongst the various stakeholder groups and has been charged wi
th 
collaborating both with colleagues at their own site and with fellow professionals from other district sites. Mentor
-
leaders 
support Facilitators by providing support throughout implementation of this professional development. The crystal
-
clear 
goals of
 
the Collaboration Days include producing a comprehensive and fully articulated Arcadia California Academic 
Standards Core Curriculum in English
-
Language Arts and Mathematics; to research and make recommendations for 
curriculum and instructional shifts tow
ards a more personalized approach to learning in the Social Sciences, Sciences, 
Foreign Languages, Physical Education, Electives, Visual and Performing Arts, Character Education, Technology 
implementation, English

Language Development, Next Generation Scie
nce Standards implementation, Project

Based 
Learning, Innovative Instruction, Google Classroom and various online and Open Educational Resources, and Special 
Education from a Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 12 perspective. Data continues to be collected
 
from the SWaGs 
through group evaluations and is then disaggregated and shared through various modalities to each stakeholder group.

In recent years, additional professional development resources have been designated for Mathematics and English
-
Language c
urriculum development and 21st Century instructional skill development, including National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) conferences, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning, in support of California 
Academic Standards implementation, Illum
inate data and assessment system, AVID, Advanced Placement, and Next 
Generation Science Standards. At the high school level, data indicated that a large segment of potentially college
-
bound 
students were not being provided access and opportunity to pursue 
honors and college
-
level courses, as their high
-
achieving classmates were. Leadership worked with teachers to engage in professional development around the themes 
of Advanced Placement (AP) open access and equity for all students over the past two years. P
rofessional Development 
resources have been designated to send teachers, counselors and leadership to the local and regional College Board/A.P. 
Forums. Continued professional development will be pursued at the national level.
 
 
Full implementation of the Ad
vancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program continues to be a focus of 
professional development dollars over the past seven years.
 
 
Individual school sites have been tasked with working with the Instructional Coaches to conduct professional devel
opment 
around the themes of the California Academic  Standards, including rigor, focus, coherence, instructional strategies, shifts 
in curriculum, pacing and instructional materials, writing instruction and problem
-
solving.  Arcadia Instructional Coaches 
h
ave become regional professional development leaders by presenting at conferences and through their instituting the 
San Gabriel Valley Instructional Coaches Consortium.
 
 
Staff development topics from  2012

2018 school years have included effective instruction and critical thinking, 
implementation of the electronic grade book, the California Academic Standards, identification, development and curation 
of online resources, p
edagogical shifts, brain research and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Innovative Instruction.
