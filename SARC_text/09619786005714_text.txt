By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rescue School, which serves students in grades TK
-
5, is a quiet 
oasis in a rapidly growing and changing Sierra Nevada 
foothill community. School buses pass the school on a road where cows are grazing with deer and wild turkeys appearing 
from time to time.  Approaching on Green Valley Road from the west, you will see th
e Sierra Nevada Mountains in the 
background, covered with snow in winter. Farms, fields, and houses are scattered along the hillside.  Rescue is a friendly 
place where people know each other and take the time to stop and talk. The bus drivers, principal, t
eachers, and 
secretaries are your neighbors. You meet them at the game, at the store, or at the Rescue Post Office. The school itself is 
part of the neighborhood, serving as a gathering place for meetings, soccer and Little League, Boy/Girl Scouts, communi
ty 
craft shows, carnivals, and recreational activities. Although Rescue School was built in 1958, it has been well maintained 
and remodeled to improve the buildings for safety and comfort.
 
 
Twenty eight percent of Rescue School's population are socio
-
econo
mically disadvantaged; therefore we are identified as 
a Title I school. As a Title I school, we receive additional funding from the Federal Government. Our cultural demographics 
include 2% Asian, 1% Pacific Islander, 1% African American, 13% Hispanic or La
tino, and 83% White.
 
 
Rescue Elementary has 19 regular education classrooms in grades TK
-
5.  We have one physical education prep class for 
grades 4 & 5 and one Resource Specialist class for grades K
-
5.  We offer band classes to students in grades 4
-
5.  Our
 
teachers are a highly qualified collection of nurturing and devoted professionals with consistently high standards for 
themselves and their students.  We offer a balanced instructional program with the goal of meeting the needs of the 
whole child.  Our di
strict adopted curricular materials include Benchmark (English Language Arts, GO Math, Step
-
Up to 
Writing, Scott Foresman Social Studies, and Handwriting without Tears (K
-
2).  ELA instruction is supplemented with 
Reading Counts and core literature.  Math i
nstruction is supplemented with Reflex Math and Math IXL.  Mystery Science 
and Stem Scopes Science is used to supplement Science instruction.  Academic differentiation is provided through a variety 
of methods including, but not limited to, small group, lev
eled group, and challenge group instruction.  Our Learning Center 
is also used to support students.  Teachers continue to receive staff development and collaboration time to work on 
California State Standards and with curriculum.  Rescue teachers are in th
e process of becoming certified in Guided 
Language Acquisition Development (GLAD) instructional strategies.
 
 
Rescue Elementary has a fully equipped computer lab with 31 computers to support our student technology program.  
Transitional Kindergarten through
 
2nd grade students receive instruction in the lab from their classroom teachers at least 
once a week.  Grades 3 

 
5 are equipped with a class set of Chromebooks for their classroom to use.  Grades K
-
2 have a 
bank of Chromebooks that they utilize. All clas
srooms have projectors and ELMOs to support student learning. Most have 
SMART Board Technology as well.   Rescue Elementary has a Maker Space lab for all students to utilize that promotes 
STEAM inquiry and discovery.  There are at least a dozen stations fo
r students to utilize in the Maker Space.  Rescue 
Elementary also offers a quality art program for students in grades 1
-
5.  Students receive art instruction learning about 
various historical artists and their techniques and get to apply them to various art
 
projects.
 
All students at Rescue School receive a differentiated curriculum in the regular classroom.  Appropriate learning 
experiences are provided during the school day, usually in the regular classroom. Enrichment activities, challenge groups, 
and inte
rvention groups are designed to support students and meet their individual needs.  Before and after school 
enrichment and tutoring is available for students who need extra support or desire to participate in extra activities.

Rescue School is supported by
 
the services of a nurse, psychologist, and a speech and language specialist. Our nurse is 
available 1 day a week to meet the health needs of students including vision and health screenings. The district 
psychologist performs evaluations and also meets wit
h students as appropriate. The speech/language specialist works 
with students five days a week. A Learning Center exists to support those children with identified learning disabilities. 
Rescue School also participates in Academic Assessment/Program Modific
ation, and the Individual Education Program 
(IEP) planning process. During leveled reading, students are grouped by their reading level so that all students receive 
appropriate instruction. Reading aides also work with groups of students during leveled rea
ding in order to achieve the 
lowest possible teacher student ratio. The overall goal is bringing all students to benchmark, and challenging advanced 
learners.
 
 
The Student Success Team (SST) approach is utilized to provide assistance to children experienci
ng difficulties. The SST, 
consisting of a teacher, parents, and the principal, meets regularly to develop an educational assistance plan for children 
referred by their teacher or parents.  Rescue School is an excellent example of what can be achieved when 
parents, staff, 
and teachers work together to provide a strong educational foundation and create a meaningful and memorable school 
experience for their children.
 
 
Our students are offered many enrichment opportunities which are supported by 
fundraisers, school donations and our 
PTO.  We offer competitive sports teams for cross country (3
-
5)  and basketball (4
-
5).  Other enrichment activities are 
offered through the school year including, but not limited to art, music, yoga, STEM, games, and d
ance programs.  Through 
the fundraising efforts of PTC, we are able to offer several assemblies tied to the California State Standards.  Students can
 
participate in our Student Council (4
-
5) and organize many events that foster community in our school and 
supports our 
community as a whole.  Our Garden Coordinator provides engaging lessons and experiences for all students throughout 
the year.
 
 
Our goal for our students and our staff is to exhibit behaviors in conjunction with Rescue's Big Three:  Show Respec
t, Make 
Good Decisions, and Solve Problems.  We offer successful social/emotional programs through character building and anti
-
bullying instruction.  Positive Behavior Intervention Support is currently being implemented at Rescue School.  Instruction 
is pr

classroom and school
-
wide level to recognize students who make good choices.  Character traits are featured each month 
and monthly assemblies are s
cheduled to celebrate the academic and social achievements of our students.  We employ a 
part
-
time counselor to offer individual counseling to students in need, facilitate social skills groups and deliver classroom 
lessons, such as Building Friendships, Re
spect, College and Career Readiness and Self
-
Esteem.
 
 
Rescue Elementary School was recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2010 and 2014.
 
 
 
The Mission Statement at Rescue School is as follows: At Rescue School we are committed to respecting the
 
similarities 
and differences of others on our playgrounds, in our classrooms and community. We are dedicated to providing our 
students an excellent education in a safe, clean, and nurturing environment. We hold high expectations for all students 
and provi
de them with the support to meet their full potential.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rescue School was the first school built in the district (1958). Currently the campus contains 19 regular education 
classrooms, a library, a Learning Center, a gymnasium, a technology center, an extended day room, and an administrative 
offi
ce. Students in grades K
-
5 have access to a swing set, climbing  apparatus and bars, asphalt play area, and an open 
grass field.  The custodial staff maintains campus cleanliness.  The Safety Plan is an annual document designed to highlight 
areas of pride 
within our school while detailing ongoing goals and projects that are scheduled to continue improving our 
campus and the educational experience for our community.  The Safety Plan is organized into three main categories:  
Physical Environment, Social Envir
onment, and Cultural Environment.  Each category offers objectives and goals meant to 
improve in these areas.  Several committees including the Positive Behavior Intervention Support Committee, the School 
Culture and Climate Committee and the School Site C
ouncil meet regularly to discuss school rules and procedures and 
address any school safety issues.  Surveys are also given to solicit feedback from Rescue community stakeholders.  The 
Rescue School Safety Plan can be found on our school website at www.resc
ueelementary.org under the "Our School" tab 
and the "School Site Council" drop down menu.
 
 
Rescue School is on a traditional schedule to maximize the use of facilities.  Fire department and insurance officials inspec
t 
the campus on a regular basis.  Emerge
ncy backpacks with items needed during a crisis are in every classroom. Staff 
members receive annual training re:  child protective services. Teachers and aides supervise the playground with a ratio 
of approximately 1 adult to 75 students.  Safety is a top
 
priority at Rescue School!

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
All Rescue schools receive equal allocations, per student, of LCFF Base 
Funding.  This funding helps support students by 
providing instructional materials, supplies and other needs.  Funding for support services, such as maintenance of buildings 
and grounds, utilities, and student transportation, is budgeted for at the distric
t level and provided to each school site 
based on the varying needs of the individual school.
 
 
In addition to the Base Funding described above, schools in the Rescue Union School District receive Supplemental funding 
roughly proportional to the number of u
nduplicated pupils (English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and 
Foster/Homeless Youth) they serve.  Furthermore, school sites receive allocations from other state and federal categorical 
programs, including Title I and Title II.  The purpose of 
these categorical programs range from improving the quality of the 
total instructional program for all students to addressing the unique needs of special groups of students.
