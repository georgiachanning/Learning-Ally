By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's Message
 
 
Welcome to Hope School! Hope School is located in Santa Barbara, a beautiful Spanish colonial small city on California's 
central coast. Santa Barbar
a's economy is based primarily on a tourist and service economy. Our city has a rich history, 
with many historic sites focusing on the area's cultural heritage. We enjoy the Channel Islands offshore and the nearby 
Santa Ynez Mountain range, which adds to t
he natural beauty and unique environment of the area. Santa Barbara boasts 
many fine educational institutions, including the University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara City College, and 
Westmont College. We believe that the first years of for
mal education are critical for gaining the foundation skills and 
developing the habits of mind that will ensure success in later years. Our goal is to launch children into a world of lifelon
g 
learning. Our dedicated teachers and staff have a deep understan
ding of teaching and learning within a nurturing and 
stimulating environment. Children are challenged and supported to explore and discover their world. Hope School is more 
than just a school; it is a community. Our parents are important partners and are v
ery involved in the school, with the 
Parent Teacher Association raising a significant portion of the total school site budget. We are the Hope School Waves, 
and like the waves of our beautiful Pacific Ocean, we are in constant motion, a force for change in
 
the world, today and 
tomorrow.
 
 
I invite you to explore Hope Elementary School's Annual School Accountability Report Card, which provides valuable 
information about our school's instructional programs, academic achievement, classroom materials, 
school safety, 
facilities, and staff. As you review this document, we are sure that you will see why we are very proud of our students and 
our school. We hope that you will also visit us at our website: http://www.hopeelementaryschool.org

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Hope Elementary School are aligned to the California Content Standards. 
Instructional materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based material
s and adopted by the 
State Board of Education. The district follows the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials 
(English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
In the fall, the Hope Elementary School District's Boa
rd of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to which 
textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted a Resolution which 
certifies as required by Education Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and
 
instructional materials were provided to all 
students, including English learners, in the district to the extent that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials
, 
or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instruc
tional materials were provided to each 
student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and 
content of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/lan
guage arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls 
used for their visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2016
-
17 school year, Hope Elementary School District di
d not 
offer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not require the distribution of respective textbooks and instructional
 
materials.

st 2019. Deficiencies 
noted in the school inspection survey were corrected immediately by the district's maintenance department. During fiscal

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are performed by the Administrative Team/Curriculum 
Council using tools such as teacher input, state assessment results, and data analysis to determine the areas in which 
additional teacher t
raining may enhance classroom instruction and increase student achievement levels. Hope Elementary 
School supports ongoing professional growth throughout the year on minimum days. Teachers meet in grade level teams 
to conduct data analysis to identify area
s of need. Teaching staff are provided the opportunity to participate in district
-
sponsored staff development workshops or training session as 1) a supplement to site
-
based staff development, 2) for 
reinforcement of or follow
-
up on previous training, or 3)
 
follow
-
up training for newly implemented programs/curricula.
 
Hope Elementary School offers support to new and veteran teachers through peer coaching and mentoring. Instructional 
aides are provided targeted training focused on teaching strategies and curriculum content. Substitute teachers are invited 
to participate 
in designated staff development activities. All staff are encouraged to attend professional workshops and 
conferences. Classified support staff receive job
-
related training from department supervisors and district representatives. 
 
For the 2019
-
2020 year, 
the district will continue to have teams of teachers engaging in MTSS staff development as part 
of a recent grant award.
