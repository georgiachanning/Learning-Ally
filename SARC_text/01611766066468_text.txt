School Description
 
Welcome to John Gomes Elementary School, where we at Gomes endeavor to engage students in 
active and meaningful learning, and strive to facilitate a love of learning, diversity, collaboration, 
and inno
vation in a safe and caring environment.
 
 
We are working together to create an academically rich and challenging school environment while 
encouraging our children to be compassionate, caring, productive citizens of the world. The staff 
and parents have 
high expectations for every student. There is a strong emphasis on basic skill 
development, along with enriching and engaging curriculum. We focus on building student self
-
esteem, respecting fellow students and adults, and developing an appreciation for le
arning.
 
 
Gomes Elementary School is an outstanding educational institution, complete with skilled, 
dedicated educators, motivated and achieving students, and involved parents. John Gomes 
Elementary School was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 2018!
 
 
A
bout the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California 
public school. Under t
he Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are 
required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activit
ies to address state and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional inf
ormation about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact 
the school principal or the district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and
 
Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are
 
presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Gomes Elementary School was built in 1970 (Gomes is celebrating a 50th year birthday, this year) . In the 2005

2006 school year, the school underwent 
modernization. Most of the work was done in 
Pods One, Two, and Three; the main Administration Building; the Multi
-
Use Room; and the Kindergarten 
Pod. In addition to strengthening the roof, the workers extended the walls of the classrooms in the pods. The heating system 
was upgraded, and air
-
conditio
ning was added. The to
-
do list also included, adding new drinking fountains and improving the existing ones. The office restrooms and the 
entryway into the current portables were modified to become wheelchair accessible. The Gomes playground blacktop was r
esurfaced and lines repainted. 
The school is well maintained by the district maintenance department.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facili
ties 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.  Based on that survey, we have answered the que
stions you see on this 
report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the 
report. Since that time, those conditions may have 
changed.

education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parenta
l Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportun
ities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to be part of the Gomes learning community, and we depend on parents to keep our programs runni
ng smoothly. 
Parents can join our School Site Council (SSC), which works with 
the administration and teachers to help make financial decisions. We also have parent
-
run activities, such as The Fine Arts Mini Experience (FAME) program and the PTA sponsored Reflections Arts Program . Parents
 
are essential to our Safety 
Patrol, because 
they help maintain safety at drop off and pick up times and help students cross the street. Room parents organize parent volu
nteers to 
help with special projects in the classroom and to chaperone on field trips. We buy new books for the library through an 
annual book fair and parents 
are needed to help make it successful. The PTA sponsors campus beautification days, when parents come to maintain our gardens
 
and plant flowers on 
the grounds with their children. We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Nig
ht in the fall and Open House in the spring. We always need new 
volunteers! Please contact our principal, Mr. Douglas Whipple, to find out how you can help.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The principal and our Safety Patrol, composed of parent volunteers and students, monitor the school grounds for 20 minutes 
before and after school. 
Teachers supervise the morning recess, and noon supervisors and the principal supervise lunchtime. Teachers regularly review 
safety rules, and the 
administration holds town hall type meetings with all students to outline responsibl
e behavior in school and on the playground. Visitors must sign in at 
the office, where they receive a Gomes Visitor sticker.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised in October of 2019 and reviewed with the staff at staff meetin
gs. T
he plan includes 
procedures for emergencies, updated exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make the plan and procedures avail
able on our school 
website and keep copies in the office for parents. We practice a fire or disaster drill every m
onth, and hold large disaster drills in the fall and spring, with 
the whole school staff and parents engaged in emergency role
-
play.
 
 
Gomes has an active health and safety committee made up of both parents and teachers that meet once a month to discuss and
 
plan school readiness 
in case of emergencies.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time 
each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
201
8: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
