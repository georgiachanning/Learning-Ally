By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rancho Elementary School is one of TVUSD's original schools, opening its doors in 1987. In 2017/18 our school's enrollment 
was approximately 524 students. 
 
 
In 1999, the school underwent an expansio
n adding 9 classrooms, a computer lab and library to the site. At Rancho 
Elementary School we believe that all students can be successful learners. We believe that learning is a life
-
long process 
in which students, teachers and parents must work closely to
gether to ensure student progress and success during the 
school experience. The staff at Rancho Elementary School is committed to providing an educational learning environment 
that is safe, caring, nurturing, focused and responsive to student needs. Instru
ction is based on District curriculum, which 
is aligned with the California Standards and incorporates a variety of materials and strategies. Student products reflect 
students becoming independent learners and participating citizens as 21st Century Learner
s. 
 
 
The Rancho School community holds the following core values: 
 

 
Focus on results
 

 
Decisions made on the best interest of students
 

 
Respect of teachers, staff and students
 

 
Value parents as participants
 

 
Maintain the integrity of district
-
wide 
expectations while meeting the needs at the school site level

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Rancho Elementary School was built in 1987 making it the third oldest elementary school in the district. It originally had 

-
site childcare facility.
 
In 
1999, the campus was expanded to 40 classrooms with a computer lab and library being created. Being an older site, there 
are sometimes more maintenance demands. But those demands are met by our district Maintenance and Operations 
Department in a timely
 
manner. Cleanliness of the site is maintained by one day
-
lead custodian and a district night 
custodial crew. Buildings are cleaned and restrooms are cleaned, stocked and sanitized daily. The condition and cleanliness 
of the school grounds, buildings and r
estrooms is continually being evaluated and improvements being made as needed. 
Students, parents and staff feel safe as we pursue improvements in safety and security at Rancho School. This is evidenced 
by the results of our student and parent surveys and p
arent, student and staff input to our school safety plan. Whenever 
an unsafe condition is detected, immediate steps are taken to mitigate the issue.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Multiple opportunities to attend meetings at different times of the day, and location will be made available to parents 
based
 
on their input. Parents are given the opportunity to provide input on the Parent Involvement Policy on an annual 
basis. SSC and other parent groups, such as ELAC, provided input on the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). 
Regular meeting with SSC/C
AP and ELAC are held to discuss Title 1 allocations in the SPSA. Consistent communication is 
given to parents from teachers on students' academic progress. Electronic communication is sent to parents through

School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is 
updated and approved annually. The plan covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and egress and ensuring a 
safe and order
ly environment. Additionally, the plan includes data on suspensions and expulsions as well as school and 
district crime data.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully secured by fencing. School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at the
 
fro
nt office prior to entering campus utilizing the District Raptor Electronic Sign
-
in System. . In instances of emergency, 
we use an automated telephone system to contact parents with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff
 
for emergencies, our school conducts fire, earthquake, and lock down 
drills regularly throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire 
drill each month they are in session as well as an earthquake dril
l at least four times during the school year.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff
 
development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during 
formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and pr
ovide instructional support as teacher 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New 
State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curriculum and assessments. Teams began by identifying 
priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to
 
facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and
 
grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data and transition to New State 
St
andards.
