By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We the staff of McCloud Elementary School, in partnership with 
our students, parents, and community members, are 
committed to preparing our students for success in the present and future world
 
 
Description of School and Community
 
McCloud Elementary School is located in McCloud, California, a small mountain community s
ituated at the foot of Mt. 
Shasta. The population of the town of McCloud is about 1,100, and the school enrollment K
-
8 is 55. The community is 
predominantly white. English is the dominant language. The town has struggled economically for years due to lack 
of 
industry and other employment opportunities.  The timber industry is no longer the main source of jobs. Many of the new 
jobs are in the service industry. The U.S. Forest Service employs a large number of workers as do various land management 
companies. 
Most of these jobs are seasonal, resulting in a low economic standing for the community. Many families face 
months of unemployment each year.  However, the town has made a movement toward tourism as a new economic base.  
Many families work outside the comm
unity in neighboring towns like Dunsmuir, Mt. Shasta and Weed.  Rental properties 
in McCloud are severely limited and families have had to move in order to find a home to rent.  The MCSD is attempting 
to pass an ordinance that would limit vacation rentals 
due to the negative impact on the community and population.
 
 
McCloud Elementary School provides the following for all students: a stimulating environment, a well
-
maintained school 
plant, one administrator, 3 full
-
time certificated teachers and two part tim
e teachers. The school employs classified staff 
for instructional aides, office, cafeteria, and custodial duties.  The district provides all basic textbooks, all necessary 
supplies and materials, P.E. equipment, a well
-
stocked library, audio
-
visual equipme
nt, computers and software.  The 
District contracts with the Siskiyou County Office of Education for specialized services and personnel. These services 
include: a Resource Specialist, Speech and Language Specialist, School Psychologist, School Nurse and Oc
cupational 
Therapist.
 
 
Our school also offers an after
-
school program for all of our students.  Students receive a healthy snack, help with 
homework and the ability to participate in some interesting extracurricular activities such as: music, art, sewing, 
computer 
graphics and some culinary activities. Our sports program is also linked with our after
-
school program. The S.A.F.E. 
(Siskiyou Afterschool for  Everyone) program begins at 12:30 P.M. for our kindergarten students, at 2:45 for the 1st to 3rd 
grader
s, and at 3:00 for all other students.The program remains open until 6 P.M..

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
The main building houses classrooms for grades K
-
8, a well
-
stocked library, a science room, Special Education room, a 
cafeteria/multipurpose room and office area. The preschool classroom is a separate building. The buildings, including 
restrooms, a
re clean, safe, and in good repair.  The custodian/maintenance personnel is dedicated to maintaining a stable, 
clean and safe environment for staff and students.
 
 
Fire alarms and heating systems are in good repair and working order.  The building has acces
s to internet throughout and 
each classroom has desktop computers for staff and student use.  Every student has access to a computer via desktop or 
Chromebooks with a more than 1:1 student to computer ratio.  The wireless internet access is provided via a 
link 
connecting us to the high school.
 
 
Our grounds are very large and well
-
maintained, with two blacktop playing areas that have basketball hoops, and large 
playing field areas. The northern playground and parking lot were repaved in the summer of 2019.  
The southern 
playground is not used for recess or PE; therefore repair has not been budgeted.  The school was painted in the summer 
of 2013.   The roof was resurfaced in critical areas in 2018 and is maintained as needed in problem areas.  More will be 
don
e to repair the roof in years to come; however, the cost of a complete roof replacement is beyond the district's budget.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The McCloud Community PTO officers are very active in organizing events for the school and are responsible for helping 
educate our parents about the needs of our school. The PTO has paid for field trips and special events that our students 
m
ight not otherwise have enjoyed without their help. This year the PTO added Movie Nights and maintained a concession 
at sporting events to raise funds. Parents can become a part of the McCloud Community PTO at any time throughout the 
year. 
 
 
McCloud Elemen
tary has benefited from several parent groups and corporations donating to support our Young 
Imaginations music program. The Chamber of Commerce, the McCloud High School Alumni Association, the American 
Legion Women's Auxiliary, the McCloud Community Recre
ation Council, the McCloud Garden Club and other business 
owners also contribute funds to support enrichment activities in the school. Great Northern has provided snacks and food 
bags for our families during vacation days. Some other examples of our parent
 
and community involvement occur when 
parents, alumni and community members attend our McCloud After School program to share their expertise in a variety 
of areas. 
 
 
Parents are invited to several events throughout the year at McCloud Elementary School. Pa
rticipation rates are high at 
Back to School Night, Open House, Parent
-
Teacher Conferences, on field trips and volunteering in class. Parents are 
encouraged to complete satisfaction surveys each year in the spring. Over 95% of parents return surveys each y
ear and 
most express satisfaction with the school and special programs. 
 
 
In order to engage parents/guardians positively in their children's education, the Superintendent encourages staff 
members to do the following:
 

 
Help parents/guardians develop parenti
ng skills and to provide home environments that support their children's 
academic efforts and development as responsible members of society.
 

 
Inform parents/guardians that they can directly affect the success of their children's learning, and provide them 
w
ith techniques and strategies to improve their children's academic success and to help their children in learning 
at home.
 

 
Initiate consistent and effective two
-
way communication between the home and school, so that 
parents/guardians may know when and how 
to help their children in support of classroom learning.
 

 
Receive training that fosters effective and culturally sensitive communication with the home, including training 
on how to communicate with non
-
English speakers, and how to give 
parents/guardians opportunities to assist in 
the instructional process both at school and at home.
 

 
Encourage parents/guardians to serve as volunteers in the school, attend student performances and school 
meetings, and participate in Site Council and 
other activities, in which they may undertake governance, advisory, 
and advocacy roles.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Strong leadership from the teaching staff and Administration ensures a high quality educational program based on current 
research, and developmentally appropriate expectations for instruction and State Standards. The staff 
has diligently 
followed the developments in Common Core Standards and CAASPP testing. In 2017
-
2018, with the addition of Discovery 
Education E
-
books for science curriculum, the teachers partook of professional development and related training. 
Teachers wer
e instructed in the use of the online curriculum in order to provide access to online resources for students.   
Teachers took part in online webinars for training on the new social studies curriculum, Studies Weekly and use of 
Renaissance Math and Reading 
(FLOW 360).
 
 
All staff members have been involved in a variety of activities to improve their skills and bring new techniques, materials, 
and methods to the classroom. Teaching skills are upgraded by attending summer classes, after
-
school classes, in
-
servi
ce 
training, and specifically designed training to meet teachers' needs. Emphasis has been placed on keeping current on 
Common Core Standards and implementation.  Training in ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences) will take place in 
February of 2020.
 
 
Math t
raining in our new curriculum took place throughout the 2012
-
2013 school year and was provided by the Siskiyou 
County Office of Education.  In
-
house training and shared best practices occur monthly on Collaboration Days.  Due to the 
small staff, it is ofte
n more cost effective and logistically effective to conduct training in
-
house.
 
 
Future Professional Development will be in Common Core Standards implementation and the new Smarter Balanced 
testing.  Our 4/5 teacher and her mentor are participating in the s
econd year of Alliance for Teacher Excellence (ATE).  
Training in the new FOSS kits is coming in 2020
-
2021 as well.
