By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Principal's message:
 
Welcome to the 2019
-
2020 school year
! The staff and I are excited about continuing to create an optimal learning 
environment for all of our students. Our school believes in the success of every student. Our mantra is "Education is an 
Economic Equalizer". With this belief, we work hard to pro
vide a quality education with high academic rigor for every child 
every day. We are building a culture of valuing education and enthusiasm for learning. Thus, our goal is to produce 
proficient students who will be career and college ready in order to compe
te in this competitive global society. We engage 
our students to high academic achievement and engage the students in meaningful, purposeful, and engaging lessons and 
activities. We are committed to the success of all students and strive to meet their indi
vidual needs. In addition to the 
classroom teachers, we also have support staff to work with students in their areas of deficiencies. We have Mrs. Garcia 
as our Literacy Coach to help our students with reading and writing. Our math coach is Mrs. Medrano. T
he coaches work 
with our regular classroom teaching staff to differentiate the learning experience to bring out the best of all students.
 
 
A key component of teaching the California Common Core standards is for students to use a Chromebook to increase thei
r 
technological experiences in these digital times. Chromebooks are important in a world where typing skills and computer 
literacy are increasingly necessary and engaging children with computers at an early age will enable them to reap the 
benefits in late
r life.  The CAASPP testing system is built with important Interim testing components which give the 
students experience with the test format and data for teachers concerning students' strengths and weaknesses and the 
final Summative testing in the spring.
 
The new CAASPP Common Core testing is now done on the computer, so this also 
gives them practice to be familiar with how to read and write on the computer before testing.
 
 
We will continue to participate in our awards program, academic competitions, Accel
erated Reader, the Merced County 
Spelling Bee, Junior Olympics, and the Merced County Writing Festival.
 
 
Parents, thank you so much for your incredible support of our school and programs. I welcome any volunteers to help in 
the classrooms, events, and our 
site council. As the principal of this school, I am so very proud of the work that we do with 
our students each day. Last year, our students worked very hard on their studies and behaviors.  I cannot begin to count 
the number of awards given at the awards 
assemblies to reward student achievement.  I am so proud of these students 
and their commitment to their academic and social education.  We appreciate the support and involvement of our parents 
and families.  Students are more successful in school when the
y know education is a priority in the family's life.  Students 
are excited to see their parents in the audience when they receive their award at the awards assemblies and performances.  
We have several parents that volunteer daily to help in the classroom 
and help the teacher to prepare materials.  Our 
Sparkes School Site Council membership is growing and is another opportunity for parent involvement.
 
 
Frank Sparkes Elementary has a history of academic excellence.  The students and staff have proven over an
d over again 
that our students are able and choose to succeed in learning the California state standards.  We have been implementing 
the California Common Core State Standards and were successful in our testing.
 
 
Thank you for taking an interest in the edu
cation of all our students.
 
Ka Vang, Principal

In addition to the media center, other instructional space includes 13 permanent classrooms and 14 permanent portables.
 
 
Regular maintenance of the facility is a co
mmitment of the District Maintenance Plan to ensure regular painting and 
upkeep in accordance with standards for optimal safety and comfort. Custodians clean each of the rooms every day. The 
District provides maintenance technicians and groundskeepers to m
anage and tend to routine and unexpected repairs.
 
 
The cleanliness of the grounds and restrooms is good and we have a person who checks and performs any needed cleanup 
during the time students are in school. The two full
-
time custodians work after the regu
lar school day ends. The 
maintenance staff performs daily preventative maintenance.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

wide plan, which is reviewed annually. The School 
Safety Plan was most recently 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty in August.  The plan was last updated 
March 13, 2017 and will be in effect until 2022.  If new Board policies are adopted, those are shared with the staff 
immediately following the Board meeting. The Saf
ety plan includes specific plans for lockdowns, fires, earthquakes, and 
other major catastrophes.  Fire drills are held monthly, with debriefing afterwards.  Lockdown and earthquake drills are 
held every quarter, also with debriefing afterwards.  Visitors 
are required to register at the office before going onto 
campus.  Each visitor signs in and is issued a visitor's tag, which is to be worn in plain sight while on campus.  Visitors a
lso 
must sign out when leaving. The School District Safety drills will be 
incorporated into quarterly practices.  The district 
updated the Visitor Policy this Fall, making each school a "closed campus" and update procedures for visitors on campus.
 
 
Periodically, we have in
-
service meeting with the Merced Sheriffs 
Department, or firefighters regarding safety on campus.  
In August of 2018, WSD staff members attended an "Active Shooter" Training at WMS.

The traffic flow is an issue that we continue to work with our Community Officer to correct. Parents have been give
n a 
map with traffic flow and parking/ no parking areas.  We have a staff member crossing students in the parking lot and we 
have hired a crossing guard to cross students on Almond Ave. Students are released at walking and car gates manned by 
staff members
.  The front pedestrian gate near the office is electrically monitored and visitors must be buzzed in to have 
campus access.  There are several surveillance cameras installed around the campus.  Fire, earthquake, and lockdown 
drills are practiced.  Campus 
security is a priority, and concerns are handled immediately.

The implementation of the Common Core State Standards is continuing.  Students and teachers are using the skills 
necessary for the Common Core State Standards:  communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.
 
 
For year 2019
-
2020, the Winton School District will continue its focus on providing collaboration dates for all grade levels 
and 
training in math and science Common Core standards. The professional development will be offered during school 
workshops. School administrators and coaches will provide support and any needed supplemental materials to help 
teachers deliver learned instruct
ional methods.
 
 
For the 2018
-
2019 school year, Winton School District focused the professional development time to the Common Core 
State Standards:  the implementation, and materials to make the paradigm shift.  Winton School District had CAASPP 
(California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress) training days for all of its teachers. These trainings focused 
on English Language Arts and Math taught using Common Core strategies and materials along with the implications on 
the Interim and Summative CAA
SPP tests.  Throughout the implementation of these strategies, teachers had collaboration 
time and analyzed data to evaluate the effectiveness of the lessons taught.  Along with the paradigm shift, the use of 
Chromebooks was also expanded due to the CAASPP
 
testing being done on computers.  Students are continuing to learn 
how to read, write, and research on the internet using the computer lab computers and Chomebooks in the classroom.
 
 
In 2017
-
2018, CAASPP Interim scoring professional development was deliver
ed to the teaching staff.  The Interim tests 
provide valuable information to the teacher via assessments that mirror the CAASPP in the spring.  Teachers are provided 
with information not only on the progress of the student, but also standards and skills th
at were not understood well by 
the students.  Students also benefit by seeing sample questions and the types of questions along with practice on how to 
take the tests on the computers.
 
 
2017
-
2018 professional development was conducted with the new ELA adopt
ion of McGraw
-
Hill Wonders at the beginning 
of the school year.  The company representatives provided information on the components and how to use the new 
materials.  In addition to the print components, there are many online materials for teachers and stu
dents to access. One 
collaboration date is provide each year for teachers to look at data and plan lessons to accelerate learning for students.
