By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

San Lucas Union Elementary held a public hearing on 10, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuan
t to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-

textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take hom
e. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
t
eachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priorit
y: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Ca
lifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alter
nate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements fo
r entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

has an active San Lucas S
chool Parents' Club. Parents' Club allows parents the opportunity to be involved in school 
activities and put on events for the community. Any funds raised by the Parents' Club are used to enhance the education 
of the students at San Lucas School. Parents 
have many other opportunities to be involved with areas such as School Site 
Council, volunteering in the classrooms, or chaperoning field trips. Since 2014, parents are invited annually to a meeting 
to give their input on the formation of the Local Control
 
and Accountability Plan.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Lucas Elementary is committed to the 
safety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions which 
contribute to the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
 
1.
 
Child Abuses Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are requir
ed by law to report any cases of suspected 
child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any 
follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
2.
 
Disaster Procedures: The Safety Plan addresses all disaster 
procedures in order to ensure the safety of students 
and school personnel. Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated for effectiveness.
 
3.
 
School Discipline: San Lucas Elementary has created a schoolwide discipline plan based on Positive Behavio
r 
Intervention and Support (PBIS). It is outlined in the Student Handbook, and communicates high standards and 
expectations. It holds students accountable for their behavior. Every student receives a copy and it is reviewed in 
student assemblies and classr
oom presentations. Staff members consistently enforce the schoolwide standards.
 
4.
 
Procedures to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: If a student is deemed dangerous because of behavior at 
school or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by 
county juvenile authorities, the teacher(s) of 
the student will be promptly notified of the status of the student.
 
5.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: San Lucas Elementary strictly adheres to district policies which prohibit sexual 
harassment or discrimination of
 
any kind. The sexual harassment policy is outlined in the Student Handbook at 
the beginning of the school year. Employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware 
of any incidents of sexual harassment.
 
6.
 
Schoolwide Dress 
Code: San Lucas Elementary believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive 
school environment. The primary standards for student dress and grooming include: the student should be neat 
and clean at school, and the student should not wea
r clothing that compromises safety or modesty or that is 
disruptive to the educational process.
 
7.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: San Lucas Elementary believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to 
ensure a positive learning experience for all stud
ents. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, administrators, campus supervisors and parent volunteers 
consistently supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral expec
tations and safety standards.

Office of Education. This program partners each new teacher with an experienced teacher who serves a
s a mentor and 
coach. Participants receive ongoing training for two years. Current training was provided on district curriculum, 
technology, and assessments and data analysis. Additionally, teachers and administrators may be released from duty to 
attend wo
rkshops or conferences conducted throughout the year. Staff participates in two on
-
site district professional 
development days and 7
-
8 Professional Learning Community meetings per school year. The first PLC of each school year 
involves a review of testing 
data and identification of student needs. For the 18/19 year, teachers received PD from their 
newly adopted ARC Curriculum and the iReady Math intervention (by Curriculum Associates). For the 19/20 year, teachers 
received Math PD and technology PD from the
 
Monterey County Office of Education.
