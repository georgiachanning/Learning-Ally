About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Pla
n
 
Teachers, child supervisors, and administrators help monitor the school grounds during recess, before school, and after schoo
l. Visitors are required to 

 
 
The school safety plan focuses on proce
dures for fire drills and evacuation routes. It also includes steps for earthquake preparedness and lockdown 
procedures. Students practice fire drills on a monthly basis and earthquake drills twice during the year. Staff and students 
have been instructed o
n the 
steps to take in the event of an armed intruder on campus or nearby, and about appropriate lockdown procedures.  This revisio
n was presented to 
parents during a School Site Council meeting in the Winter of 2019.
 
 
School gates are locked 15 minutes af
ter children have been dropped off at the start of the school day, and access to the school is limited to the main 
entrance. This helps prevent unauthorized visitors from entering the campus during the school day. The gates are opened again
 
10 minutes befo
re the 
end of the school day while students are being picked up.
 
 
We review these procedures with staff and parents at the beginning of the school year at staff meetings, parent meetings, and
 
in parent memos. We 
review them again throughout the school year
 
as needed. School staff continues to received training on Positive Behavior and Intervention Support, PBIS, 
a school wide discipline plan designed to reward positive student behavior.
