School Description
 
Cerra Vista School is a family
-
oriented community in which the students, families, staff and 
community members share the commitment and vision of providing the best education possible 
for all students. Cerra Vista's commitment to student
s succeeding is strongly aligned with the 
school District's expectations and vision of an extraordinary learning community where each of our 
students are prepared for future success. This is evidenced in the alignment of planning, use of 
time, designation 
of human and fiscal resources, and on
-
going monitoring of student progress.
 
 
Everyone within the Cerra Vista community shares the common vision of academic success for all 
students. Response to Intervention principles and ongoing assessment data are used b
y all staff to 
continually adjust their instruction and to help all students meet and exceed grade level standards. 
Teachers meet regularly in grade level teams to review standards and data, and align instructional 
lessons with the essential Common Core st
andards. Parents are kept abreast of school events via 
monthly updates on the school's website and School Messenger. Many parents are monitoring their 
student's progress online by accessing the electronic grade book. State, district, and school 
assessment 
results are provided to parents to assist them in understanding their child's progress, 
areas of strength, and areas of weakness. The Cerra Vista website includes student links to 
electronic learning games and activities that students can use at school or 
at home.
 
 
At the core of Cerra Vista's success is a caring and dedicated professional staff. Teachers across 
grade levels support each other professionally and personally. Teachers continue to build 
relationships with their students, parents and staff with
 
the Capturing Kids Hearts Program.  
Parents are a very important and involved part of each classroom and an integral part of our school 
community. Education is highly valued by our families and there is a high degree of parent 
satisfaction, involvement, a
nd pride in our school. The Parent Club is invaluable to our school 
success. Their monetary contributions provide a wide range of extra curricular activities and 
classroom materials. This along with many volunteer hours are major contributors to Cerra Vist
a's 
success.
 
 
There is a strong commitment to excellence on the part of the entire staff. Cerra Vista boasts an 
outstanding teaching staff with many teacher leaders who are experts in language arts, 
mathematics, science and technology. These experts are le
ading the way as we move closer to full 
implementation of a STEAM school.   Improvement in student achievement is directly related to all 
teachers working in Professional Learning Communities, focusing on the use of assessment data, 
Common Core standards, 
standards
-
based materials, and research
-
based strategies. Cerra Vista is 
often a leader in researching and implementing new strategies.
 
 
Through a partnership with the greater community, parents, staff, and students, Cerra Vista School 
has made great strid
es toward achieving our school vision and mission. We are committed to doing 
whatever it takes to ensure students are prepared to be learners and leaders in their future.
 
Cerra Vista School's Vision is that ALL students become lifelong learners who are res
pectful, 
responsible, collaborative and productive citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of s
tudents and staff is a primary concern at Cerra Vista Elementary. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regul
ations, including 
those pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster preparedness plan i
ncludes steps for ensuring student and 
staff safety during a disaster. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake drills are conducted every other month, and loc
k down drills are conducted 
at least twice a year. Safety information is provided by a priva
te consultant, and is included in staff meetings every month. The Safety Plan for Cerra Vista 
Elementary School is updated each spring, and a summary is distributed to all staff members at the beginning of each school y
ear. Copies of the safety 
plan are sh
ared by law with the district office, local officials, law enforcement, and are available for review. Each year, a safety ins
pection is conducted 
by the custodian, administrator, and district maintenance staff. An independent safety consultant inspects the
 
campus each winter. All visitors to the 
campus are required to sign in at the office and display a visitors badge at all times. Supervision is provided for students 
throughout the school day; the 
responsibility is shared between the school staff and yard 
supervisors. Our school wide behavior policy and matrix includes our Capturing Kids Hearts 
program which focuses on encouraging students to be respectful and make positive choices, ensures fairness and delivers consi
stent consequences.

Types of Services Funded
 
In addition to state funding, Hollister School District receives federal categorical funding. In 2018/19 the district receive
d funding from the following 
programs: Title I 
-
 
Education for the Disadvantaged, Title II 

 
Teacher and Principal Training and Rec
ruiting, and Title III 
-
 
English Language Acquisition and 
Academic Achievement. Using general fund money in combination with categorical funding, the district provided every K 

 
5 elementary site (also the K 
-
 
6 and K 
-
 
8 sites) with an Intervention Teache
r and a Physical Education Teacher. The Intervention Teacher plans with teachers and provides small group 
intervention instruction. The P.E. Teacher provides the required minutes of instruction to grade level groups of students, al
lowing the teachers more 
time to collaborate about instruction and/or provide intervention instruction.
 
 
Students who qualify also participate in after school intervention classes, provided through the Supplemental Education Servi
ces, Title I. Students who 
qualify through Migrant 
Education receive additional intervention services.
 
 
Site
-
based Title I funds are used to support the Response to Intervention program. Decisions about the expenditure of these funds 
are made with the 
School Site Council, based on achievement data for the 
school.
