By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Through a unified effort among staff, parents, and community, Merced Elementary School strives to nurture students into 
becoming empowered, lifelong learners who embrace responsibility, effective collaboration, and
 
self
-
discipline.
 
 
Merced provides an excellent educational program for children in the community. This is accomplished through an 
unwavering commitment from Merced staff, community, and parents that have continuously worked together over the 
years to crea
te an exceptional school. While academic subjects such as reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social 
studies are vital in education, other skills such as collaboration, communication, problem
-
solving, critical thinking, 
information literacy, and cr
eativity are equally important. Merced's staff has identified higher
-
order thinking and digital 
citizenship skills as critical commitments. This will allow students to learn effectively and live productively in the emergi
ng 
global society. Merced provides 

classrooms. Teachers help students investigate, write, publish, and share their work in new and varied ways. Merced staff 
continuously adjusts practices and designs incre
asingly advanced learning experiences that motivate students to think 
about their own understandings and reflect on what they have learned. Access to extracurricular activities during regular 
school hours such as robotics, coding, dance, music, and visual 
arts are provided to all students. In addition, a physical 
education consultant has been contracted to implement an innovative approach to quality physical education. 
 
 

-
generation immigrants that 
struggle with balancing English language 
acquisition while mastering grade
-
level standards. For that reason, Merced provides its staff with specific, formal training 
on diversity, intercultural pedagogy, language development, and formative assessments thro
ugh which teachers can track 

much as possible into the general education setting per their IEP goals. The Special Education Teacher wo
rks 
collaboratively with the general education teachers to plan instructional opportunities aligned with the core curriculum. 
Modifications are made to make the core curriculum accessible to students. In addition, as appropriate, our special 
education stud
ents attend an Extended School Year (ESY) program in the summer to help maintain the knowledge learned 
during the regular school year. The Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) has welcome meetings with foster youth to 
ensure they have all the necessary res
ources to be successful at Merced. Moreover, she monitors their academic progress 
and recommends intervention as needed to help address any achievement gaps.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Merced has 
received a school rating of exemplary on the latest School Facility Condition Evaluation. Some of the areas 
that were inspected include gas leaks, mechanical systems, sewer, restrooms, and overall cleanliness, among others. The 
fire equipment and emergency
 
systems were tested and appeared to be functioning properly. The playground and school 
grounds were also found in clean, safe and functional conditions. There were no broken/malfunctioning gates, windows 
or fences found at the school. The school's parking
 
lot and playground have been recently renovated and expanded. The 
district conducted a wireless upgrade during the fall of 2019. Network improvements and new telephone systems are 
anticipated to be installed by the summer of 2020. Merced has a sufficient 
number of classrooms to accommodate all its 
students. To ensure the safety of our children, student supervision starts at 7:40 am and continues throughout the day. 
Students who participate in the after school program are supervised by the YASES Program lea
ders during that time.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may
 
participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

familiar with the school educational programs and initiatives. During parent
-
teacher conferences, parents discuss 
individually their child's academic progress. To promote parent involveme
nt in their children's education, Merced has a 
Special Education Parent Liaison who helps parents navigate the special education process. Merced's Foster Youth Liaison 
monitors foster students and facilitates meetings between all the stakeholders in the ch
ild's education. Our district's 
unique Family Resource Center provides a range of services and assistance, such as tutoring, enrichment programs, and 
community resources. Open House is an opportunity to showcase students' projects and learning. Merced offe
rs a series 
of meetings to address the needs of all students which include topics requested by parents. These workshops might 
address areas such as Common Core Standards, Special Education, English learners, strategies to use at home to support 
a child's e
ducation, school assignments, effective use of technology, among others.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Merced believes that all children deserve to be in a safe learning environment in which they can learn the necessary skills 
to successfully navigate life academically, professionally, and socially. Many Merced students need additional socio
-
emotional suppo
rt. Our teachers address this need through a research
-
based process (Capturing Kids' Hearts) and by 
building meaningful productive relationships with students.
 
 
Every year, the school reviews its safety plan in accordance with District guidelines. The plan is reviewed with parents, 
faculty, and student groups. In addition, Merced holds monthly emergency drills; which include: 1) earthquake, 2) fire, 3) 
lockdown, a
nd 4) armed intruder. On Wednesday, December 18, 2019, Merced Elementary School Safety Plan was 
approved by the School Site Council. Prior to its approval, the plan was reviewed by the school's Safety Committee, a 
group of parents, teachers, and the school
 
administration. Merced's Safety Plan provides appropriate programs and 
strategies to ensure the safety of students, parents, and staff members and includes: a) Child Abuse Reporting Procedures, 
b) Disaster Response Procedures, c) Disaster Preparedness Dri
ll Log, d) Discipline Policies, e) Procedures for Notifying 
Teachers About Dangerous Pupils, f) Discrimination, Harassment, Bullying and Hate Crime Policies/Procedures, g) School
-
wide Dress Code Prohibiting Gang
-
Related Apparel, h) Procedures for Safe Ingr
ess and Egress from school, i) Procedures 
to Ensure a Safe and Orderly Environment, j) Rules and Procedures on School Discipline, k) Crisis Intervention Handbook, 
and l) Suicide Risk Assessment Handbook.

Merced uses a variety of instructional programs to support the needs of its diverse population. Such programs include i
-
Ready, 95% Group, Words Their Way, Burton Reading, and SIPPS among others.
 
 
English Learners:
 
Every year, students identified as English
 
Learners take the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California 
(ELPAC) to assess and monitor their progress toward English Proficiency. These students receive support during reading 
and content
-
area instruction. Merced teachers incorporate a va
riety of activities to help their English Learners students 
acquire the language and literacy skills to be successful in school and beyond. Such activities may include: 1) explicit and 
intensive academic vocabulary instruction through a variety of instruct
ional activities, 2) integrated oral and written 
language instruction within the content area, 3) plenty of opportunities to practice oral language and 4) small group, 
targeted instruction.
 
 
Intervention:
 
Merced offers a comprehensive intervention program 
during regular school hours and during after school hours for 
students who need additional support. Students who do not make adequate progress are referred to the Student Success 
Team (SST), which includes: teachers, students (as appropriate), parents, the
 
school psychologist (when needed), and the 
school administration. These students are monitored on a regular basis by their classroom teacher, Teacher on Special 
Assignment (TOSA), and the school administration. Four times a week, the school TOSA and the r
eading support teachers 
work with small groups of students from  Kindergarten through fourth grade to build foundational reading and literacy 
skills.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education:
 
The Gifted and Talented Education Program (GATE) provides opportunities fo
r students whose abilities and talents have 
been identified as exceptional or advanced. These students receive differentiated instruction during regular school hours 
or during the after school hours in the form of individual assignments, special projects, 
or extracurricular activities.
 
 
Special Education:
 
Students with special needs receive a full range of options to meet their educational needs in the least restrictive 
environment (LRE). When a child is identified as possibly needing special education serv
ices, the Student Success Team 

school, review interventions already tried, design/modify an action plan, and provide support. When it
 
is appropriate, a 
student may receive an Individual Education Plan (IEP), which includes a referral to the Education Specialist, placement 
options such as specialized academic support, full inclusion, or if needed, a Special Day Class, speech services, or
 
any other 
additional related services.

Foster Youth:
 
Merced has assigned a site liaison for foster/homeless youth whose role is to provide support to the student and his/her 
family. The liaison greets new students, monitors their progress, and meets wit
h the families and students to provide 
assistance. Foster youth and homeless students have access to resources such as counseling, academic support, school 
supplies, or referrals to external agencies.
 
 
Low

verty have a higher risk of developing a variety of social, emotional, and behavioral problems. Students 
whose families are experiencing financial hardship receive additional emotional or academic support to succeed at school.

red for counseling during school hours or to receive additional academic support during or 
after school hours.

Merced teachers continuously work on gaining a deeper comprehension of how to implement the Common Core State 

school; especially, those at 
risk of not meeting the state academic content standards. The certificated and classified 
personnel at Merced participate in a variety of professional development activities. Full
-
day professional development 
workshops are scheduled before the start of the
 
school year and in January.
 
 
In addition, every Wednesday, students are dismissed an hour earlier to allow time for building teacher capacity. During 
that time, Merced teachers meet for one hour, for professional development or collaboration time.  Profes
sional 
development workshops are presented by the school principal, the school TOSA, members of the leadership team, 
selected teachers, district TOSA, or external consultants. Some of the topics planned to be covered during the 2019
-
2020 
school year includ
e i
-
Ready Math, Eureka Math, Response to Intervention (RtI), Technology Application in the Classroom, 
Benchmark Advance, CAASPP Interim, and Summative Assessments, Early Literacy, Reading and Writing Strategies, 

rts, among others. During grade
-
level meetings, teachers analyze student 
data, latest teaching strategies, study pacing guides, create assessments, or collaborate on lesson planning. The reading 
support specialists and school TOSA also meet during this tim
e or join different grade levels to monitor student progress 
in literacy. Vertical articulation among grade levels also takes place on Wednesdays. Consecutive grade levels analyze 
student progress throughout the years, common standards, and expectations fo
r each grade level. During the year, the 
School Principal meets with each grade level and the support team to review the assessment plan, to make sure that 
interventions are in place to meet the needs of struggling students and to guarantee that the school
 
is moving in the right 

paraprofessionals to emphasize that in
-
class differentiated instruction meets the academic needs of all our students. 
During 
the 2019
-
2020 school year, Merced teachers will have multiple opportunities to attend conferences and 
workshops. These include Kindergarten Conference, iSTEAM, Growth Mindset, and CUE, among others.
