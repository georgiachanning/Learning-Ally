School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 2019
-
2020 school year is the 10th year of Redwood Shores School operations.
 
Age of Buildings: This school has 22 classrooms, a library, a l
earning center with conference rooms, a multipurpose room 
and administrative offices. There are three part
-
time music teachers and one science specialist. Two daycare classrooms 
are also on site. The initial campus was completed in August of 2010. Phase II
 
of construction was completed in the 
summer of 2012. This includes two buildings containing classrooms and offices for small group instruction. Phase III 
construction was completed in the summer of 2015 to add two classrooms and three small group instruct
ion spaces.
 
 
Cleaning Standards: The District has adopted cleaning standards for each school, which are implemented by the district 
Facilities Department and Site Custodial Team. The principal and custodians developed a new schedule for morning and 
evening custodial shifts this year to ensure a clean school campus. They also developed a schedule for irregular and non
-
daily cleaning and maintenance tasks in order to prevent deferred maintenance and keep all aspects of facilities in working 
order.
 
 
Mai
ntenance and Repair: District maintenance staff, assisted as necessary by outside contractors, keeps the school in 
good repair.
 
 
Complaints and Reports of Conditions Requiring Remedy: All pathways need to be clear. Sonitrol alarm closet must be 
cleared of 
storage. Landscaping could be managed with better trimming and fixing of broken sprinklers. Signs can be 
updated on campus. Loud noise due to the HVAC system near room 9 could be analyzed for potential maintenance. The 
school library needs blinds on doors.
 
Some window closure hardware in the office needs repair.
 
 
Recent facility improvements include the update to HVAC filters in each classroom, changing out lights in classrooms to 
LED, and updating and fixing lights around the exterior of the buildings.
 
 
Pl
anned facility improvements include new fencing for certain areas of the school and padding is to be added to a pole on 
the field to prevent student injury.
 
 
As of December, 2019, the restrooms are vented as designed.  Repairs and aesthetic issues are bein
g addressed on an 
ongoing basis.  The thermostat in room 5 has been repaired.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and families at Redwood Shores Elementary are essential to the success of our students and our school. As every 
family has different strengths, interests, and circumstances, we offer an array of ways to 
be involved and to partner with 
our school. Our more visible volunteers play roles such as Resident DJ, Crosswalk Leader, Hot Lunch Server, Recess 
Supervisor, Room Parent, and the like, while others work behind the scenes in roles like Volunteer Webmaster,
 
Enrichment 
Club Coordinator, or Assembly Liaison. From ongoing commitments to one
-
time special guest roles such as visiting a 
classroom to serve as a "Mystery Reader", we seek to work with all families to enhance the work we do for our students. 
We also h
ave a lively Art in Action program in many of the grade levels, completely run by parent volunteers.
 
 
Structures that provide many opportunities for parent involvement include Site Council/ELAC, Parent Teacher Association, 
and SchoolForce, Our website prov
ides basic contact information and meeting dates, but over 90% of the parents of 
currently enrolled children at Redwood Shores also use Konstella, our parent
-
school communication platform, to view all 
committees, events, and ways to get involved in detail 
and to sign up for specific dates and to support specific initiatives 
or events. On Konstella, parents can email the leads of various activities and sign
-
up for volunteer opportunities and 
school
-
based events. PTA General meetings are held on Friday mornin
gs while School Site Council meets on Thursday 
evenings. These meetings are specifically held at different times of day to include as many families as possible. It is our 
goal to involve our families and to help everyone to feel like a valued member of our
 
community.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Redwood Shores Elementary School's site safety plan is revised, updated, and approved annually. The most recent plan 
was updated in October 2019. Staff reviewed and provided feedback on the plan at a staff meeting in the middle of 
October. They were also a
sked to talk through the plan with their grade
-
level teams following the whole staff gathering. 
The final version of the plan is reviewed and approved by the Associate Superintendent, Superintendent, and the district 
school board.
 
 
Key elements of the plan
 
include: Emergency contact information, evacuation locations, staff roles and responsibilities, 
and five emergency response protocols per San Mateo County Office of Education guidelines (evacuation, 
drop/cover/hold, secure campus, lockdown/barricade, and 
shelter in place, also known as the "Big Five".) In addition, 
preventative measures to provide a safe school environment in which student vulnerability to adult misconduct include 
open lines of visual supervision through classroom doors and windows and acc
ess to facilities is limited to areas needed 
by keys and alarm codes given to various staff.  Lastly, the plan includes suspension data and other student engagement 
metrics so that stakeholders can have input on the school's efforts toward a culturally res
ponsive climate in which all 
children can succeed.
