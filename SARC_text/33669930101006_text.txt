School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sundance Elementary, built in 2004, is located in the city of Beaumont, California which lies in the beautiful San Gorgonio 
Mountain Pass area. What sets Sundance Elementary apart is the fact that w
e "live" our mission. Our Mission: Sundance 
Elementary School is committed to combining its energy and resources to provide the following for all students and staff: 
1) A safe, orderly, positive, child
-
centered, learning environment and 2) A hands
-
on, mean
ing
-
centered educational 

cultural understanding and sense of self
-
worth. This will be accomplished through the active and cooperative efforts o
f 
students, staff, parents and community.
 
 
At Sundance, we are extremely proud to have earned a Gold Ribbon Award, California Distinguished Schools Award, seven 
Title 1 Academic Achievement Awards, and a National Blue Ribbon School Award! We attribute this
 
to the collective spirit 
of teamwork and commitment that exists between staff, students and parents. This collaborative relationship and 

an
d supportive culture is immediately obvious to new parents and visitors.
 
 

remains constant. Our daily attendance averages over 95% and we
 
have maintained this rate for the past fifteen years. 
Our parents are committed to making sure their children attend school regularly and students demonstrate their 
commitment by making continuous academic growth. We believe that extra
-
curricular activiti
es help to enhance our 
positive school climate.
 
 
Come and visit us!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sundance Elementary was originally constructed in 2004 and is comprised of 29 regular classrooms, 4 kindergarten 
classrooms, 1 
multipurpose room, 1 cafeteria with covered outdoor eating area, 1 library, 1 staff lounge, and 4 separate 
play areas. Administration works with the custodial staff (3 full
-
time), to ensure that the cleaning of the school is 
maintained to provide for a cle
an and safe school. The District's Board of Trustees has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the District. A summary of these standards are available at the Educational Support Facility for review.  
Maintenance and repair by District maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority are given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this 
report, please note that even minor discrepancies are 
reported in the inspection process.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget. The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides matching funds on a 
dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school Districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor s
ystems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

As part of the continual professional growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at 
both the district level and individual school sites to administrators, teachers, and classified staff. The primary areas of 
focus for sta
ff development are selected based on the collective needs of the District staff, to mirror what is relevant to 
our current student population, as well as support our District Instructional Focus Statement: Students will be able to 
construct viable argument

both orally and in writing, across content areas, using evidence from multiple sources.
 
 
All

day trainings include a variety of professional development opportuni
ties that have been provided the last two years 
in August (for new teachers) and October and February for all Beaumont USD staff including the most current topics in 
education. At the site level, we determine which teachers to send to training through Rive
rside County of Education 
(RCOE). Professional development is delivered through conference attendance (Illuminate, CUE, Elementary AVID, 
ELA/Math CA standards, PBIS, etc.) Staff returns and reports out to all staff and/or grade levels.

g (in

meetings by our Instructional Coaches occurs on a regular basis (Topics include: ELA and Math strategies, Learning Targets 
& Success Criteria, Number Talks
, Close Reading, Data Analysis, integrating technology using Google Chromebooks (and 
more.) Teachers support each other during collaboration time each week on our Early Release Day, participate in peer 
coaching at their grade level, and through discussion 
of student performance data.
