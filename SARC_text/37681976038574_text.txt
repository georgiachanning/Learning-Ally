School Description
 
Built in 1946, Rolando Elementary School is located in La Mesa, California and serves approximately 
550 students. Rolando Elementary is designed to 
meet the various instructional needs of students 
in kindergarten through sixth grade. Nineteen classroom teachers, together with special education 
staff, an intervention teacher, support staff, and administration ensure successful learning 
experiences for 
each child.  We are an official No Excuses University school, a network of over 200 
schools across the nation focused on academic and social success through 6 Exceptional Systems: 
Culture of Universal Achievement, Collaboration, Standards Alignment, Assess
ment, Data Analysis, 
and Intervention.  No Excuses is about the adults ensuring each and every child learns.  It is our 
commitment that each and every child has the ability to reach academic proficiency and social 
successes and that we the school have the 
power and responsibility to make that a reality.
 
 
Our Character Counts program supports all students in developing the intrinsic values that allow 
them to be caring citizens with life
-
long skills that are the foundation of success. Programs like 
Character 
Counts, Safe School Ambassadors and whole group/small group lessons increase their 
abilities to solve interpersonal problems peacefully. Our Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) 
classrooms provide targeted instruction for students with special needs with
 
the support of six 
paraprofessionals. Our intervention teacher provides daily small group reading instruction for 
students who need additional support in reading, English Language Development (ELD) instruction, 
support for grade level intervention, and sm
all group counseling lessons for students who need 
additional support in a variety of areas such as, family changes, self
-
control, kindergarten readiness, 
and friendship. Our classroom teachers differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all learners, 
i
ncluding targeted Essential Standards instruction. A variety of after
-
school enrichment classes 
provide additional opportunities for students to advance their skills and develop their interests. We 
offer a high quality, academically
-
based, before and after
 
school program through ESS (Extended 
School Services).  In addition, we believe in educating the whole child through capitalizing on their 
strengths and interests.  This year, through a partnership with our PTA, Rolando provides music, 
dance, art, and the
ater opportunities for all of our students.
 
 
We have defined our purpose to build a strong academic and character foundation in each child by 
providing an instructional program that emphasizes high standards of achievement for each and 
every student 
partnered with character education to develop responsible citizens. Rolando 
embraces a culture of universal achievement with the belief that each and every child deserves the 
opportunity to be educated in a way that prepares him or her for college if he or
 
she chooses to 
attend. We want all students to learn at high levels every day. We are tenacious about 
improvement, and use a collaborative model with research
-
based practices to accomplish the goals 
we set each year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in C
alifornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local education
al agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, da
ta reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca
.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Professional 
learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a common languag
e around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards through the selecti
on of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experience, with ex
tra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face professional d
evelopment. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
based instruction,
 
Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can use to deescal
ate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
With professional
 
learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that it is releva
nt, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to analyze stud
e
nt data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
