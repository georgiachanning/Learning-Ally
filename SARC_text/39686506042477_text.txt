With

there
 
has
 
been
 
an
 
emphasis
 
on
 
providing
 
training
 
for
 
our
 
teachers
 
in
 
this
 
area.
 
Along
 
with
 
district
 
wide
 
in-services,
 
teachers
 
have
 
been
 
provided
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
attend
 
multiple
 
trainings
 
on
 
the
 
Common
 
Core
 
Standards
 
in
 
both
 
Language
 
Arts,
 
Math,
 
and
 
New
 
Generation
 
Science
 
Standards
 
(NGSS).
 
 
The
 
discipline
 
philosophy
 
of
 
Love
 
and
 
Logic
 
has
 
been
 
implemented
 
school
 
wide.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
discipline
 
philosophy
 
that
 
encourages
 
relationship
 
building
 
with
 
students
 
and
 
students
 
being
 
held
 
accountable
 
for
 
the
 
natural
 
consequences
 
that
 
come
 
with
 
decisions
 
they
 
make.
 
Teachers
 
have
 
been
 
inserviced
 
on
 
the
 
components
 
of
 
Love
 
and
 
Logic
 
and
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
daily
 
with
 
their
 
students.
 
Our
 
library
 
contains
 
Love
 
and
 
Logic
 
resources
 
that
 
are
 
available
 
to
 
staff
 
and
 
parents
 
to
 
use.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
attend
 
trainings
 
and
 
conferences
 
involving
 
Love
 
&
 
Logic.
 
Love
 
and
 
Logic
 
also
 
supports
 
our
 
Multi
 
Tier
 
System
 
of
 
support
 
that
 
will
 
assist
 
our
 
students
 
with
 
social
 
and
 
emotional
 
needs.
 
Ripon
 
Elementary
 
uses
 
Purposeful
 
People
 
and
 
Character
 
Strong
 
curriculum
 
to
 
support
 
social
 
emotional
 
learning.
 
 
We
 
strongly
 
encourage
 
positive
 
character
 
traits
 
for
 
our
 
students.
 
Each
 
month
 
a
 
specific
 
character
 
trait
 
is
 
identified
 
school
 
wide
 
and
 
is
 
discussed
 
by
 
the
 
teachers
 
with
 
their
 
students.
 
Recognition
 
of
 
students
 
who
 
demonstrate
 
positive
 
character
 
traits
 
are
 
done
 
at
 
all
 
monthly
 
assemblies.
 
 
Our
 
Mission
