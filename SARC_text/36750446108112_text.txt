By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The 
custodial staff and district maintenance department take great pride in Hollyvale Elementary's beautiful campus and 
work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning 
for students, staff, a
nd visitors. The principal and custodians communicate daily regarding maintenance issues and special 
projects. Hand
-
held walkie
-
talkies enhance two
-
way communication efforts and help facilitate an immediate response to 
emergency situations. The custodian, 
proctors, teachers conducting physical education instruction, the school office, 
administrators, and after
-
school program director carry hand
-
held radios. One full
-
time day custodian and one evening 
custodian are assigned to Hollyvale Elementary and work c
losely with the principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial 
duties, and special events. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards, 
graffiti, or other conditions that require removal prior to student
s and staff entering school grounds. After breakfast and 
lunch, cafeteria tables are immediately cleaned and the floor is swept. The day custodian checks the restrooms several 
times throughout the day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities stocked, s
afe, and sanitary. The evening custodians 
cleans classrooms, desks, restrooms, windows, doors, and floors, and are responsible for set up and take down of 
equipment and/or furniture for afternoon and evening events.
 
 
Hollyvale Elementary works closely with
 
the district's Maintenance & Operations department (M&O) for larger projects, 
routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables Hollyvale 
Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs,
 
urgent repairs, or special projects. Teachers and school 
staff submit requests to the custodian, an administrator, or office staff who prepares and submits a work order to M&O 
for resolution. Emergency situations are regularly resolved in one hour or less
.  The most recent School Facility Good repair 
Status was conducted on July 25, 2019.
 
 
Planned or recently completed facility improvements:
 
Fire exit sign replacements are planned

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Ca
lifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alter
nate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements fo
r entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: Mathematics test results include the 

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met th
e standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of s
tudents in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of 
students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

The Comprehensive School 
Site Safety Plan was developed for Hollyvale Elementary in collaboration with local agencies 
and the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting 
procedures, teacher notification of dangerou
s pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival 
and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. The plan's most recent review and update by 
school staff took place in October 2019. Staff training to
 
discuss staff and safety plan updates took place during staff 
meetings at the beginning of the school year. A copy of the school site safety plan may be obtained at Hollyvale 
Elementary's main office or the Hesperia Unified School District office.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around State Standards and are 
research
-
based. We place an emphasis on early literacy, developing Units of 
Study, Project Based Learning, STEM, 
Technology, and the 4C's (Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity). The following is the total 
amount of professional development days were provided for the following years: 2016/17: 15 Days;  20
17/18: 16 Days; 
2018/19: 24 Days
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the distric
t 
and school site. Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activiti
es based upon individual 
student needs, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas. Supplemental training involving curriculum, 
teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of reading/language arts and math were provided at 
site 
request via Coordinator of Staff Development and Academic Coaches.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the principal, assistant principal, and Staff Council. Training programs and 
topics were chosen based upon the school focus and student n
eeds. Results from Single Assessment Data, common 
formative assessment data, teacher feedback, and findings from classroom observations help identify areas for 
improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging and rigorou
s standards
-
based 
education fostering student success and proficiency.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supple
mental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff development topics and 
focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the district's Professi
onal Development Committee, 
Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. The Professional Development Committee meets four times a year to 
review student test results from state and district assessments and review teacher survey needs. The Principal
s' 
Roundtable provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and share training needs based upon data analysis and 
classroom observations from each school site.
 
 
New teachers receive intensive support and training through the district's Induction 
Program and New Teachers Academy. 
For beginning and out
-
of
-
state teachers, the district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Beginning 
Teacher Support and Assessment), a statewide and state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing suppo
rt and skill 
building through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to support year
-
round hiring practices; the orientation is a 
comprehensive overvie
w of the district's policies, school law, English language learners support, curriculum, instruction, 
and grade
-
level and content area specialties.
