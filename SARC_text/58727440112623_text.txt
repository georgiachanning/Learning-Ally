School Description
 
The faculty, administration and support staff provide an exemplary learning 
environment. 
Academic learning is the
 
primary focus of the school, but our teachers operate on the principle that 
a caring environment that fosters self
-
esteem
 
and individual development is the best approach 
toward facilitating learning. Students are able 
to approach all
 
facets of their learning with 
confidence and assurance that this school is their home. Rules of conduct are realized
 
internally, 
leading to self
-
direction and initiative.
 
 
At Riverside Meadows Intermediate School, it is the belief of the st
aff, patrons, and students that 
our primary purpose
 
is to maximize the intellectual, social, physical and emotional growth of our 
students. We are dedicated to students,
 
families and community working together to realize 
individual dignity and potential.
 
R
iverside Meadows Intermediate serves over 400 students from 
the small community of Plumas Lake. We are currently a
 
6th
-
8th grade school. Our school currently 
runs a traditional 7 period day where all students have access to an
 
elective course. Classroom 
in
struction is based on state content standards that are taught, assessed, and then retaught
 
when 
necessary. We offer various types of interventions after the school day ranging from targeted 
standards
 
based support to general walk in homework or tutoring he
lp. Our teachers are dedicated 
to their students and are
 
always willing to assist students after school or during lunch hours to 
provide extra support.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Riverside Meadows directs all funds to support the academic achievement of stu
dents.  Funds are 
used to provide instructional resources, professional development for teachers, and technology to 
enhance curriculum.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., 
test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the Califo
rnia State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending
 
on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (P
riority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to th
e University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the

Riverside 
Teachers participate in professional development every Monday through the use of early release days.  Professional developmen
t is on going 
and structured to ensure teachers meet the diverse needs of students.   Staff also has the opportunity to participate
 
in "Non Student" days built into the 
schedule to provide training on best practices.  PLUSD also offers teacher lead professional development opportunities in the
 
areas of best practices and 
technology.  The site principal budgets conferences, trainings, 
and seminar fees each year so teachers can leave campus and receive training by 
professionals outside of our school district.   The school site principal also may budget content area consultants to provide
 
training in the area of 
instructional strategies s
pecific to a content area.  The consultants serve as instructional coaches to help provide specific feedback and training to 
department staff on site and in the classroom.
