By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/11
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or scie
nce lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the S
tate 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The campus is well maintained and the staff takes pride in their clean and safe campus. All staff are trained and instructed 
to report all safety hazards immediately.  The facility is evaluated on a regular basis by both site administration and Distr
ict 
personnel.  Repairs that cannot be fixed by site staff are reported through an online work order process.  District personnel
 
m
anages and coordinates repair and maintenance needs.  In addition, an internal work order process is used by teachers 
to report facility needs to the site custodians.  The site principal monitors these facility needs through informal walk 
through visits an
d custodian meetings.  At least twice a year, District personnel conduct a formal facility inspection.  The 
site principal and head custodian meet with the evaluating team to review findings and to devise any necessary plans for 
improvements.  In addition 
to parent and student surveys, all staff complete an annual facility satisfaction survey.  Results 
are computed and a report is given to the site by District personnel.  All results are used to assess ongoing needs and 
concerns in order to provide a learni
ng environment that is clean, safe, and functional.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is a top priority with the students and staff at Sam Vaughn School.  The Safety Plan is rewritten each year by staff 
and approved by School Site
 
Council and Student Council.  Each building and classroom has a current evacuation plan in 
case of an emergency.  Fire Drills are practiced on a monthly basis. Lock down drills are practiced three times a year and 
earthquake drills are practiced once a ye
ar.  Teachers provide age
-
appropriate instruction for every class, stressing walking 
to and from school safely, saying no to drugs and alcohol, and not talking with strangers.  We have traffic signs with flashi
ng 
lights to improve the student safety coming
 
to and from school in the crosswalks with students who are trained on 
crosswalk safety. The campus is well maintained and the custodial staff takes pride in their clean and safe campus. All staff
 
are trained and instructed to report all safety hazards imm
ediately.  The facility is maintained in a manner that assures 
that it is clean, safe, and functional and is evaluated by District and site administration on a regular basis.  Input from s
taff, 
student, and parent surveys, as well as other data and informa
tion were used to guide the revising of the current plan.

Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development o
pportunities for staff.  Mondays after school are dedicated to staff and grade 
level meeting times, for teachers to participate in staff development, collaboration, learning strategies, and developing 
action plans to meet identified student needs.
 
 
The dis
trict provides a formal induction training program with the mission of providing Ceres students with teachers who 
use research
-
based instructional design and delivery norms, who actively collaborate and reflect on their practice, and 
who use formative asse
ssment data to continually grow in their professional practice. In addition, the district fully supports 
classroom teachers with a cadre of full time instructional coaches who can assist with the implementation of curriculum 
and strategies.
 
 
School sites m
ust include a professional development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include 
attendance at summer institutes, after school or Saturday workshops, teacher release days to attend conferences, 
technology development, and grade lev
el or department release days for in depth professional development.  All 
professional development is aligned to the district strategic plan.  The goal of all professional development is to increase 
student achievement.
