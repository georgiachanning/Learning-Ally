Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Little Shasta School, established in 1858, is a two
-
room 
school situated on the north flank of Mt. Shasta in the Little Shasta 
Valley.  The students come from small generational ranches, ranch
-
hands, and blue
-
collar workers seeking a small school 
environment.  Little Shasta Elementary School is a rural Kindergar
ten through 6th grade district with an enrollment of 
about 26 students. There is very little mobility. Sixty percent of the students receive Free and Reduced Lunch Services and 
zero percent of the students are English Language Learners. We have recently un
dergone a complete revitalization of our 
campus including painting, new furniture, technology upgrades and a new playground and outdoor picnic area. Our school 
is "cutting edge" in every respect while maintaining the small, country traditions we've had sin
ce 1858
 
 
The school is composed of two classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room (cafeteria, library, and small stage), and a small 
computer lab with limited space. The cafeteria is used for an after
-
school program which is supported solely by the school 
district. 
 
Our technology teacher is also the Director of the After School Program.  A strong Parent Club provides additional 
funding to supplement student learning activities, supplies, technology, and academic fieldtrips.
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT: Little Shasta provides
 
a safe and nurturing environment to promote lifelong learners and 
responsible citizens equipped to achieve their goals in a global society.
 
 

 
 
Motto/slogan 
-
Continuing the tr
adition....where kids come first!
 
 
Beliefs
 
Little Shasta Elementary School seeks to create a challenging learning environment that encourages high expectations for 
success through development
-
appropriate individualized instruction that allows for individua
l differences and learning 
styles. Our school promotes a safe, orderly, caring, and supportive environment. Each student's self
-
esteem is fostered by 
positive relationships with students and staff. We strive to have our parents, teachers, and community mem
bers actively 
involved in our students' learning.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Student safety, health, and well being are considered a foremost priority by all who work at LSE. Regular facility reviews 
check for safety and health issues and appropriate repairs are completed as 
a result.  The district follows a comprehensive 
scheduled preventative and deferred maintenance program to offset costly repairs and minimize disruptions to the 
instructional program.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emerg
ency repairs are given the 
highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices, and bathrooms are clean and well maintained.
 
 
A major school remodel project was completed during the summer of 2017 including the painting of all inter
iors, new 
paneling, new furniture, rugs and carpets. A new library was also added in an used area. The school's technology 
infrastructure also was completely overhauled. A new fire suppression system was installed.

on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents help with many fund

local field trips. Last Year the Parent Club hosted a major fundraiser that made over $18,000. and donated $12,000. to the 
purchase of a new school van. The parents are

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety, health, and 
well
-
being are considered a foremost priority by all who work at the school.  Monthly checks 
for safety and health issues and appropriate repairs are completed as a result.  The school is in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to ha

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring students and staff are safe during a disaster.  Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted on a regular basis.  A school wide discipline prog
ram holds each child accountable for his/her behavior.  Parents 
and students understand the consequences for misbehavior. A student/parent handbook specifically spells out student 
and parent expectations.
 
 
We believe that safe, secure educational facilitie
s and procedures that are fair and equitable, promote a positive 
educational environment.  Student well 

 
being will be the first consideration in decision
-
making. Behavior that demeans 
the dignity or self
-
worth of any individual or group will not be toler
ated.  The staff believes through positive interactions 
and mutual respect, academic and citizenship behaviors improve.  The adopted discipline code is given to each student 
and family prior to school in the Parent Student Handbook.  It contains the rules 
and consequences.  Consequences are 
fair and consistent and in line with the California Education code.

The Staff and School Board completely revised and up dated the school's Comprehensive Safety Plan this past year which 
included consultation with all f

with students. New technologies including Surveillance Cameras and Intercom and electronic gates have recently been 
installed..
