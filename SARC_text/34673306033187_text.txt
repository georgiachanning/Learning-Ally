By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school wi
thin the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual stan
dards
-

textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textb
ooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended mate
rials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cordova Villa Elementary was originally constructed in 1966 and is comprised of twenty
-
five classrooms (25 cl
assrooms 
are currently in use), one cafeteria, one library, one staff lounge, one computer lab, and two playgrounds. The 2009 
modernization included the remodeling of the main building, replacement of three portables,  the construction of a new 
multipurpos
e room, and the refurbishment of the school fields and landscape.
 
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of one (1) full time and two (2) part time custodians to ensure that the 
cleaning of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and s
afe school. The district governing board has adopted 
cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for revi
ew.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the
 
school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to 
emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are
 
reported in the inspection 
process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar ba
sis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent 
involvement is essential to the academic success of children. Therefore each year we allocate a portion of our 
budget to fund parent workshops and parent education.  Volunteers are encouraged to be involved in the classroom, on 
field trips, as well as othe
r school wide events.
 
 
Opportunities for family involvement go beyond the instructional day. Parents are a required component of the school 
site plan, site council, and bilingual advisory council.  Parents are asked to join our family STEM nights, Back to 
School 
Night, Open House, assemblies and student performances throughout the year.  Our English Language Advisory 
Committee hosts regular meetings to provide input and recognize the cultural diversity of our families and students.  The 
School Site Council 
plays a key role in reviewing the School Safety Plan and School Plan for Student Achievement.
 
 
We are proud to have  a computer in the school office dedicated for parents' use to enhance communication through 
access to Powerschool, and we provide parent tr
aining for our Spanish speaking parents for six weeks during the summer.  
We are confident that these measures will not only enhance parent involvement but will allow us to disseminate important 
and/or urgent information to our families in a quick and effi
cient manner.
