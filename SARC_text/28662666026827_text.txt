Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council, Leadership Team and 
Administration annually revises a School
-
Wide Safety Plan,  modeled on the 
National Emergency Management System, with input from the Sheriff's Department and American Canyon Police 
Department.  Staff members regularly review district policies about student
 
safety and conduct, classroom behavior, 
bullying and harassment, and the discipline policies contained in the NVUSD "Standards for Student Behavior." Our focus 
on safety, health, and character education, in addition to promoting positive behavior interven
tion and support, has 
resulted in a campus that is virtually crime and drug
-
free.  Donaldson Way implements Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Support (PBIS).  We Have Skills and Second Step to provide consistent behavior expectations and social skills.  T
he Principal, 
all teachers, and staff are receiving training on the Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS). Our school
-
wide motto is:  "As 
a Donaldson Way Dragon, I will be kind, respectful, responsible, and safe."  Monthly safety drills are conducted with 
support from the American Canyon Fire Department.
