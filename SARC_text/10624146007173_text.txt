By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

Lone Star Vision Statement
 
We are committed to providing instruction that is rigorous, engaging, and supportive through well
-
designed, 
differentiated lessons embedded with 
opportunities for students to collaborate and persevere.
 
 
Lone Star has a rich history, dating back to 1882, when volunteers built the first school. Principal John "Big John" Wash 
focused on individual instruction and staff development, which continues to 
be at the heart of our vision. His commitment 
to the Lone Star community can still be felt as his descendants currently attend the school.
 
 
Lone Star School is part of the Sanger Unified School District located in the proud community of Sanger, California.
 
Tucked 
between fields of locally owned grape vineyards and almond orchards southeast of Fresno, Lone Star's rural surroundings 
are fast becoming suburbanized. As the physical changes around our school have affected our growth in numbers, so has 
it created
 
an ethnically rich student population. Our 401 student "mosaic" includes children from 11 ethnicities, speaking 
13 different languages, who blend together to touch each other's lives daily. Students, welcomed from all over the world, 
attend school with th
e knowledge that their lives are enriched through the cultural diversity of their peers. Our current 
population of 31% Asian, 52% Hispanic, 3% African American and 12% White, 1% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, 
and 1% Multiple Races, Lone Star remai
ns a radiant example of diversity.
 
 
Lone Star's success comes from intense focus on teamwork where all stakeholders join, as partners, to promote academic 
excellence for all students. Rigorous, standards based, explicit instruction drives all areas of the 
curriculum areas including 
character education. Our 97% attendance rate, one of the highest in the district, is evidence of the families' support of 
Lone Star's pursuit of excellence in education. A motivated group of supportive, well
-
informed parents cont
ribute to site
-
based decision
-
making, fundraising, and classroom support while providing a positive school family atmosphere.
 
 
Lone Star's pursuit for and achievement in academic excellence is evidenced by the impressive, steady growth of students 
over 
the past 4 from 51% of students meeting or exceeding standards in ELA and from 43% to 47% of students meeting or 
exceeding standards, as determined by the SBAC Assessment.  Along with this growth, in 2009
-
10 and 2010
-
11 Lone Star 
was recognized as a Title 
1 Academic Achievement School. In 2012, .  We are committed to addressing the character of 
each child by offering a wide variety of rich experiences to develop respect, responsibility, caring, and trust and received 
the 2010, 2012, and 2014, 2016 Bonner Vi
rtues and Character Education Excellence Award. Student participation in Peach 
Blossom, Young Author's Fair, cheer and sports teams, student council, community and school service projects are 
examples of our mission to develop successful life long learners
.
 
 
The Lone Star family is proud of our commitment to and achievement in academic excellence. With positive attitudes, 
collaboration among all stakeholders, flexibility, community involvement, and celebration of achievement at every turn, 
"Big John" Wash w
ould be proud of the colorful, successful mosaic he has helped to create. We are honored to carry on 
this excellence in education.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to p
rovide comprehensive facilities inspection of every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspections are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FC
OE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or Williams, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized fo
r this report. Inspection reports 
are maintained at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant
.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critical or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facilities are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are n
ecessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this campus are disaggregated below.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school site has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually.  Plans are reviewed with staff annually often 
at the beginning of each School Year.   Lone Star's School Site Council (SSC) approves our Safe School Plan.  Emergency 
drills are c
onducted to prepare students and staff in the event of an emergency.  We strive to maintain a safe, healthful, 
nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitudes in students and staff.  A joint effort between 
students and staff help kee
p the campus clean and litter free.  Site maintenance staffs survey their campus as the first 
order of business each day.  They insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, and that the campus is 
presentable and representative of the priority Sa
nger School Board sets on safety and appearance.  Oversight of Sanger 
Unified Safe School Plans is through the Welfare and Attendance Officer.  This site's Safe School Plan was reviewed with 
site staff in August, 2019.

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading 
instruction?
 
 
All of our professional development is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed 
professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods
 
by which professional development is delivered (e.g., after school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
person
alized professional development. Sanger Unified provides professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four 
full days of training dedicated to specific initiatives, strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sang
er Unified also offers after
-
school workshops on various math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best pr
actices with one another. Teacher leaders at all sites are given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Te
achers also have the opportunity to engage in 
personalized professional development through instructional coaching.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induc
tion Program (BTSA) and New Teacher Support. A teacher that is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized prof
essional growth. In addition, the teachers attend required professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA r
eceive support from a trained support provider for two years. The

Teachers (FACT) formative assessment to guide new teachers in their ind
ividualized professional growth plans. New 
teachers, along with their mentors (support providers) attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, 
the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant req
uest and through surveys 
that include the following: Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides 
s
upport and assessment opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of 
their own professional development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their 
students. The ment
ors, called support providers, are trained in cognitive coaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are 
required to attend an orient
ation, and 2 after school trainings each year to work on their mentoring skills.

How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many distr
ict initiatives, it is essential to have support for all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coac
hing. There are varied levels of support, both at 
the site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In addition, Curriculum Suppo
rt Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teachers, (Teachers on Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum curating experience
s.
 
 
All of our professional development is based on our students and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development 
Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Sanger Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level 
District Instructional Spec
ialists to assist teachers in classroom instructional strategies. The district provided a strong base 
for Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development 
focused on academic vocabulary, content read
ing and writing, and unpacking standards. This year the district will provide 
an extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will focus on writing mini le
ssons and units.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider
 
for two years. The Sanger BTSA program uses the Formative Assessment for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professional development opportu
nities for BTSA Participating Teachers, Support Providers, and invites all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Management, Conducting Parent
 
Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, Meeting the needs of special 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teacher
s to increase understanding of their own professional 
development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops and conferences on th
e following: Literacy 
Strategies, Writing, Reading and Literacy Training, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
