Description
 
Welcome to Gardenhill Elementary School, where we have made great progress toward enriching 
student learning through the joys of reading and the experiences of successful writing. In 2018

2019, our staff continued to work together to provide ma
ny opportunities for students to engage 
in meaningful conversations about both fiction and nonfiction texts. In support of reading, our PTA 
gave each student a book at the holidays and our School Site Council (SSC) provided the funds 
needed for writing mat
erials for our classrooms to help students prepare for the Common Core 
Standards. Our students also learned new strategies for how to structure their writing in order to 


program. Teachers acknowledge students for demonstrating the monthly character trait and 
students engage in physical activities with their peers and the principal. We feel that our focus on 
reading and writing is opening up new worlds of discovery 
for our students and provides them with 
the skills needed to be successful in the real world.   We value reading at school and at home. We 
challenge our students to read more at home with many of the reading computer programs our 
school has to offer such a

-

-
2019 school year, participating in the data cycle and diving into Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) 
practices. Students are challenged to communicate, colloborate, create, and think 
critically about 
all subject areas.
 
 
We are continuing to provide our classrooms with more reading materials, and we are using 
assessment measures in order to better address the specific needs of our students. This provides 
our teachers with what they need
 
to work more successfully with small groups of students. All 
students, K
-
5, participate in a minimum of two Project Lead the Way Modules, that focuses on 
engineering practices and the scientific model.
 
 
One of the programs we are very proud of at Gardenhi
ll is our intervention program. Teachers 
analyze class work and assessments and give students extra practice and help whenever needed.
 
We were thrilled to be selected as a 21st Century School. This allows Gardenhill to use technology: 
Computers, chrome boo
ks, and iPads as a tool to help students analyze and comprehend the 
Common Core Standards and to help students develop projects that reflect their knowledge of the 
standards.  Additionally, we added apple TV's and monitors in all classrooms to enhance the 
work 
that students are looking at, creating, and sharing with their peers.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on our parents to keep our programs run
ning smoothly. We 
consider our parents as partners and rely on their volunteerism and community invol
vement in areas such as fund
-
raising, tutoring, teaching classes, 
mentoring and much more.  We do require a background check and a TB test. However, the process is simple! Just pick up a volu
nteer application from 
the office today. Parents can join our SSC
, where they work with administration and staff to help make financial decisions. Parents of English Learners 
are vital to our ELAC and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families. Room parents organize volunteers to help with sp
ecial projects in the
 
classroom 
and chaperone on field trips. We provide field trips, special assemblies, and award programs through PTA fund
-
raisers. We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences in Nov
ember. We always need new volunteers! For information 
about how you can get involved, call Crystal Gonzales, our PTA president, or Bessie Ramirez, our school secretary, at (562) 9

School Safety Plan
 
At Gardenhill Elementary School we 
teach safety from the start of the new year.  Students are introduced to our monthly character traits, have a bi
-

olunteers monitor 
the school 
grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses and at lunch time. Teachers regularly review the ru
les for safe, respectful, and 
responsible behavior in school and on the playground. We have a closed campus that is full
y fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the front 

 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit rou
tes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make 
the plan available on our school website and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan with all staff during a
 
school
-
wide staff meeting, 
and review throughout the year for updates or needs
 
that may arise, and it is approved using input from our advisory committees. We practice fire drills 
monthly; lockdown drills three times a year, and an earthquake drill during the Great Shakeout once a year. We have a storage
 
bin that houses school
-
wide 
disaster supplies, and each classroom has a backpack that holds emergency supplies.

Wednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhi
ll staff meets in grade 
level teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vit
al time for team planning.  The primary areas 
of focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative
 
and summative), 
and STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpac
king the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to 
make sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new sta
ndards.  Additionally, 
NLMUSD has adopted a new Common 
Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing 
materials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K 
-
 
2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential 
sta
ndards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school da
y to analyze data, 
discuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue 
this cycle by writing SMART goals for our 
formative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & M
ath (STEM) education 
using the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teacher
s were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training 
took place with all K 
-
 
5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project
-
based learning during the year and in the Next Generation 
Science Standards.  Gra
des K 
-
 
5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we 
believe in learning and growing as professionals.

Types of Services Funded
 
Gardenhill implements daily interventions in the Master Schedule to assist and support students.  To help analyze student rea
ding levels, teachers in 
grades K 
-
 
2 are provided a substitute teacher two times during the year to perform Developmental Reading 
Assessments (DRAs) on each student.  This 
information is useful during our intervention component of the day.  Technology programs which support our students in Readin
g and Language Arts 
include "Moby Max." "i
-
Ready" and "Scholastic Reading Counts" for Gra
des 3 
-
 
5 and "RAZ Kids," "i
-
Ready," and "Reading Eggs" for K 
-
 
2.  12 Sessions of 
after school tutoring is also offered for our struggling EL students, Low SES students, and Foster Children by our Interventi
on Teacher.  Finally, Gardenhill 
has chosen to i
mplement Project Lead the Way, a STEM program, that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in grades K
-
5. We 
feel it is important to be pioneers with the Next Generation Science Standards and to provide all students (especially girls)
 
the opportunities to be 
scientists and engineers.
