By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Kirschen Elementary School is located in the southwestern section of the city of Modesto. Built in 1987 on approximately 
five acres, the school was developed to accommodate the growing popula
tion on the Westside of Modesto. The school 
originally was built for grades K
-
1 and had less than 400 enrolled with 12 classrooms. Kirschen changed to become a year 
round multitrack school in 1991
-
92 with additional relocatable buildings added to accommoda
te over 800 K
-
6 students. 
The school is located within a low income neighborhood where all students are able to walk to school. It is unique in that 
the students represent a wide variety of ethnic and cultural groups. Kirschen is also adjacent to Robertson
 
Road 
Elementary School.
 
 
Kirschen Mission Statement:
 
At Kirschen, we will create a safe intellectual environment that is conducive to optimal learning where ALL children can 
grow and achieve their personal best. Our scholars will become independent thinke
rs, lifelong learners, and contributing 
citizens.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that student
s are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
This school has classrooms, a cafeteria, library, an early childhood ed program, and an administration office. The main 
campus was built in 1986 and opened in
 
1986.
 
 
A closed campus is maintained to insure parents of the safety of their children while they are at school. Students are not 
to leave the enclosed school grounds from the time they arrive on campus until dismissal time.
 
If a student must leave during
 
the day for a medical appointment or any other reason, he/she must bring a note or the 
parent must call the office. Students must be checked out in the office before leaving.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs nec
essary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.
 
 
Cleanin
g Process and Schedule:
 
The Operations Department has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
are available at the school office, or at the Maintenance & Operations office. The Maintenance & Operations Depar
tment 
works continuously with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

Deferred Maintenance:
 
The District participated in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provided flexible state matching fu
nds 
to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school facilities components. State 
contributions to this Program ended in the 2012
-
13 school year. Deferred Maintenance typically includes paving, roofing, 
plumbi
ng, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems. Carry
-
over funds for 
deferred maintenance projects throughout the District in Funds 01 and 14 have been exhausted. The Board has authorized 
the General Fund
 
to annually contribute $2 million to Facility Maintenance to be used for new construction and 
maintenance projects throughout the District, $2 million to Deferred Maintenance for maintenance projects throughout 
the District and $2 million to Facility Impr

against all other District site repairs and the most urgent repairs are addressed first..
 
 
Data provided by LEA. Additional information about the condition of the
 
school's facilities may be obtained by speaking 
with the school principal.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every 
school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer train
ing, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to c
omplete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in 
addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 201
9
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
