About the SARC
 
By February 1
 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Fo
rmula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and lo
cal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Plum Canyon education is the direct result of a highly qualified team of exceptional teachers.  The instructional needs of ou
r students steer the direction 
of our professional development.  All teachers engage in opportunities to stay at the cutting edge o
f professional practice in the areas of strategic 
instructional strategies, academic language development, direct instruction, arts integration, technology and physical educat
ion.  Sharing and 
collaboration are commonplace.  Teachers attend professional co
nferences and actively participate in site enrichment.  Students sense the passion and 
love of learning our teachers have, and are inspired to do the same.
