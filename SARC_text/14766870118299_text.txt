Description
 
The mission of the Bishop Union Elementary Community Day School II is to provide a safe and 
supportive atmosphere where staff, students, family and community members work together to 
create a learning environment where all participants develop 
a desire for personal growth and life
-
long learning.
 
 
Bishop is located in Inyo County along Highway 395, at the gateway to the Inyo National Forest, 
with a population of nearly 4,000.  Bishop Unified School District strives to provide a quality 
education 
for all its students, with a wide range of programs and a talented staff dedicated to the 
needs of its population.  The District serves approximately 2,000  students in grades K
-
12.
 
 
Students served at the CDS are those who qualify and who are not experien
cing success in a regular 
school setting.  It is hoped that placement in a setting with a small student
-
teacher ratio, more 
individualized instruction and closer guidance/monitoring will help the student achieve a more 
positive outcome both in school and i
n their lives.  Students may be probation referred, SARBed, 
oppositional/defiant, expelled or academically unsuccessful.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

-

Bishop Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that sufficient and current textbooks and materials are ava

inst
ructional program. Bishop Unified School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019 and determined that each school
 
within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks or instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams v
s. the State of California. All students, 
including English learners, are provided their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
All textbooks and instructional materials used within the Distr
ict are aligned with the California State Content Standards and Frameworks and have been 

-

-
year 
adoption cycl
e for core content materials.
 
 
The textbook adoption process begins with the formation of an Adoption Committee consisting of administrators and teachers. T
he committee identifies 
key elements to consider in the adoption decision
-
making process and establi
shes selection criteria based on State and District standards. The committee 
reviews instructional materials on the State list and invites publishers to provide an overview of their respective materials
. The committee examines each 
program and selects prog
rams to be piloted. Recommended programs are available for 30 days prior to adoption at the school library and District offic
e 
for teachers and parents to review. The feedback provided by teachers and parents becomes the basis for the recommendations t
o th
e Board of Trustees 
for final adoption.

Safety concerns are the number one priority of 
Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a t

staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
CLEANING PROCESS AND SCHEDULE
 
The District h
as adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is available at the school office
 
or at the District

The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides State matching funds on a dollar
-

school districts with expenditures for major re
pair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Bishop Union Elementary Community Day School II. The school is in compli
ance with all laws, rules, 

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring 
student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis. Teachers and noon aide
s monitor school grounds, 
including the cafeteria and playground, before, during, and
 
after school to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The school is a closed campus; all 

chool.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan wa
s developed by the school in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. 
The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensi
ve Safety Pla
n include 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedure
s for safe ingress and 
egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and dress code guidelines. The District collaborat
ed with the Bishop Police Department to update the 
plans at all the schools. This process created a comprehensive crisis management plan for all schools in the community. The p
lan was completed and 
reviewed with school staff in August 2012. A copy of the p
lan is available to the public at the school and District offices.
