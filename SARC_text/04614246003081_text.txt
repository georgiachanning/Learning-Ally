By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consis
tent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communi
ty members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dat
aquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our Mission:
 
 
The Rosedale community foste
rs a culture of dynamic problem solvers through Spanish immersion, by developing 
biliteracy with diverse global perspective.
 
 
Rosedale is Chico Unified School District's Two
-
Way Spanish Immersion Magnet K
-
5 school,and houses approximately 550 
students on
 
a traditional calendar. Our student population is culturally diverse. The demographic makeup is approximately 
as follows: 69% Latino/Hispanic, 26% White 1% African
-
American, and 1% American Indian, 1% Asian, with other 
nationalities making up the remainde
r.  The Two Way Immersion model provides students with the opportunity to become 
bilingual and bi
-
literate. This means that children will be able to speak, read and write fluently in both Spanish and English. 
We try to maintain a 50/50 or 33/33/33 ratio be
tween English, Spanish, and incoming Bilingual speakers throughout our 
classrooms.
 
 
Our curriculum is Common Core standards
-
based using our district's core curriculum as well as incorporating second 
language learning strategies in both Spanish and Englis
h instruction. Students' initial instruction in literacy is in Spanish, 
beginning at kindergarten. Instruction for English language learners includes daily English Language Development, and for 
English speakers, beginning English literacy skills. In other 
curriculum areas such as Math, Science, and Social Studies, 
teachers instruct in pure language, which means there is no translation in the classroom during instruction. One curricular 
area that is taught in Spanish from kindergarten to fifth grade is Mathe
matics. Students receive instruction and practice 
during Math time in Spanish.
 
 
T
h
e
r
e are currently 25 teachers on staff, a full
-
time principal, and a half
-
time Assistant Principal. Included in the total are 
25 certificated bilingual teachers 
teaching in the Two
-
Way Immersion program within our school. Also, included in the 
total is one .7 FTE Title I teacher and one full
-
time RSP teacher. In addition, we support student learning by the support of 
instructional aides and various other support s
taff and volunteers. We have created a community reading partnership to 
bring additional one
-
on
-
one support for struggling students via the support of our community. Our partnership also 
extends to our local university where college students provide multip
le hours of support to students via the guidance of 
the classroom teacher and the after
-
school certificated coordinator.  We also house an after school program funded 
through the ASES grant which provides after school academic and enrichment support for 90
 
students.   In addition to our 
onsite staff, additional certificated staff includes a music instructor, two fine arts instructors, and a PE/Health Specialis
t.  
Additional support for student services include a full time PIP Aide, a part time bilingual sch
ool based counselor, part time 
school School Psychologist, and a Speech and Language Therapist who provides one
-
on
-
one or small group services to 
students. Additionally, two part
-
time Bilingual/Bi
-
cultural Liaisons, and one part time Targeted Case Manager 
who work 
with parents and families with our home
-
to
-
school connection. A school nurse and nurse's aide provide school health 
services. Either the nurse or the aide is here for daily coverage. Also, a federal Head Start Program is located on the 
Rosedale Ca
mpus.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established
 
by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico s
tudents by a Task Force comprised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to 
review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent 
with the 
adoption cycle.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The campus has 26 classrooms available. All classrooms, with the exception of one that is used for a staff room, are being 
used for regular, speci
al education, and additional support services for students. These rooms include space for Title I, 
Resource, intervention programs, a computer lab, and enrichment programs. Classrooms and seating arrangements are 
designed for adequate flow and provide easy
 
and safe exit routes in the case of an emergency. Classroom bulletin boards 
are covered with fire
-
retardant paper. The bulletin boards encourage interaction, reference, and demonstration of 
student work. Rosedale has a closed
-
circuit television system tha
t is used for announcements about student activities and 
accomplishments, and for safety issues. A school wide intercom system is also used for announcements as necessary.
 
 
Rosedale's PTA fundraised and installed an additional play structure on the kinderg
arten playground during the fall of 
2019. Students were excited to have extra playground area to play and spread out.
 
 
Rosedale campus received many maintenance upgrades during the summers of 2016 and 2017. Those included: 
resurfacing of the blacktop, pain
ting of the entire school, updated tables and benches in the cafeteria, tree trimming, 
safety lighting in the parking lot, surveillance cameras, carpet and other general maintenance as needed. The school library 
is fully computerized and annually stocked w
ith new book titles. Athletic facilities include a multipurpose room, four 
outside basketball courts, two softball fields, two soccer fields, a track, and play apparatus. The parking areas were 
reconstructed during 2000
-
01 and a new playground structure in
stalled. The school grounds are graffiti free and used by 
a wide variety of school groups. Signs are posted for public use after 6:00 p.m.; however, groups and organizations must 
complete a Use of Facilities Form and comply to district guidelines if space 
is requested on our campus.
 
 
Supervision is provided in the multipurpose room at the beginning of the breakfast program, 7:30 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. for 
students eating breakfast and all other students who arrive early. Certificated staff supervises morning 
recess from 8:15 
until 8:30 a.m. Approximately 80 students participate in morning programs through the ASES Program and are supervised 
starting at 7:00 a.m. by certificated staff. Students are not allowed in unsupervised areas.  Rosedale also participates 
in 
the grant
-
funded ASES After School Program in collaboration with CARD from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday 
-
 
Friday. 
Students participate in academic, intervention, and enrichment activities. Chico Area Recreation District (CARD) also runs 
a simultaneous 
program which houses approximately 50 students K
-
5 as well.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant 
to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents have many opportunities for involvement in Rosedale's school programs. There are parent volunteers who assist 
teachers in classrooms, as well as those who assist in outside projects such as field trip supervision, arts programs, 
gardening, lunch ti
me activities, and organizing school events. Parent input is sought through a variety of venues such as 
School Site Council, English Language Learner Advisory Committee, and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), through 
Bilingual Liaisons, and by an open d
oor access to administration.
 
 
Rosedale has a very active PTA.  Regular PTA meetings are held on the third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m. There is 
a core group of very active, motivated parents who are working to get more parent involvement in the PTA.
 
The PTA puts 
on several events which encourage parent involvement.
 
 
Staff on committees oversee parent invitations to school activities such as Family Nights and trimester Award Assemblies. 
Title I Program informational meetings are held annually. Parent 
conferences are also an excellent method for 
communication. To communicate on a regular basis with Rosedale families, bi
-
weekly school newsletters are sent home 
in English and Spanish. Additional contact to families is made through Aeries Communication and
 
via "Simply Circle" which 
is an email contact system administered by PTA. In addition we are also using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and 
Instagram to keep parents informed. Parents appreciate all the methods of finding information. They have ex
pressed that 
it's easy to find information as we have several methods of getting the word out. The district is in the process of testing 
the Aeries messenger program to push out information to families via this method.
