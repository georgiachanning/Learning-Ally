By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Message Fro
m Principal:
 
 
Hello John Swett Community, I am enthusiastic to be with you in my fifth year at John Swett.
 
 
I am a Bay Area native and graduate of De La Salle high school.  I am in my twenty third year as an educator. I mainly 
taught middle school math for
 
9 years and I have been an administrator the past 14 years as principal and vice principal.  
I am thrilled to be part of Martinez and I'm looking forward to continuing to watch all the students grow socially and 
academically.
 
 
At John Swett, I want all st
udents to receive a well rounded education where they will learn lifelong lessons to be great 
citizens.  If students give their best effort everyday in all they do, they will have a successful experience at John Swett a
nd 
beyond.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Mike Cannon

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

John Swett 
Elementary School has a very active/generous PTA and involved parent community. Parents help in the 
classrooms, on field trips, as well as with after school activities. They raise funds that are used to support our students' 
education. Parents organize com
munity evenings throughout the year that welcome everyone in our community.  Our 
parent members of the School Site Committee are an integral part of the decision making process at John Swett. The 
parents of John Swett students are valued and true partners

Martinez Unified professional development focus for the past eight years has been to transform classroom practice to 
meet the demands of college and career readiness. Content emphasis has been on the 
implementation of the Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS), the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and the use of technology to transform and 
enhance instruction. Though each individual school site varies in its particular needs around these areas, as
 
a district the 
vision for Professional Development is consistent among all schools. As the focus has shifted from the transition to the 
CCSS to the implementation of the instructional rigor needed to fully address the standards, Professional Learning has 
had 
to shift as well. In the past few years, MUSD has emphasized the changes required of educators around key focus areas: 
mindset, intentionality, instruction, and access.
 
 
Professional Development is formally provided to all teachers two full
-
days a year
; one day in August and one in January. 
In addition to the full
-
day training provided, three half
-
day PD release times are provided to our teaching staff. This year 
these release times have been focused on Writing Calibration across all elementary sites. W
e have also provided time to 
train teachers in our new IXL online skill
-
building platform. This supplemental program provides Tier I differentiated 
support and a customized learning plan for all K
-
5 students. Additional opportunities for individual and gra
de
-
level specific 
professional development in other content areas, i.e. EL learners, math, Universal Design for Learning, etc. are also 
provided based on teacher needs and site requests.

Beginning in 2017
-
18, and continuing through and into 2019
-
20, profe
ssional development at the elementary level has 
been focused on the implementation and extension (with the recent addition of a K
-
2 Phonics Program) of Readers and 
Writer's Workshop.  To support implementation and student learning, MUSD has brought in cons
ultants who are expertly 

in varying ways over the past three years. Each year professional development has been designed to support teac
her and 
student growth, as well as rigor within this program. Training includes "demo days" where the coaches plan and model 
instruction with teachers and then, in turn, teachers practice in front of the coaches.  The coaches have also spent time 
with prin
cipals discussing the elements of the workshop model, what to look for when conducting classroom observations, 
and how to give feedback to teachers within the workshop.  This has built the capacity of our teachers and principals to 
sustain the implementati
on of high
-
quality instruction within our Balanced Literacy block.  In addition, the coaches work 
with Reading and Writing Support Teachers from each site to provide additional training.  The Support Teachers (primary 
and upper elementary teachers from eac
h site, up to four teachers per site) meet five times a year with the coaches, as 
well as provide training and support for colleagues at their respective school sites via staff meetings, grade
-
level training, 
and 1:1 support.
 
 
The JSE teaching staff is imp
lementing Reader's and Writer's Workshop on a daily basis. Teachers who attended a week
-
long summer training in New York are sharing their knowledge with staff in the area of Writer's Workshop.  Through 
Professional Development teachers are developing mini
-
lessons and collaboration. Our entire 1st
-
5th grade is 1:1 with 
mobile devices. K 
-
 
2nd have iPads and 3rd
-
5th have Chromebooks. Additionally, our Kindergarten classes have one iPad 
for every two students and each teacher has a MacBook Air to use as well.
 
All teachers are implementing the Bridges math 
program and receiving professional development in this area. Our entire teaching staff is on Twitter and use this resource 
as a way to communicate with parents and each other.  Teachers have also attended out
side professional development 
opportunities such as Reader's Workshop and Notice and Note.
 
 
This is the fourth year we have received SBAC data, teachers are looking at areas of strength and weakness to focus on 
where they want to attend professional develo
pment.
