By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Dexter's Mission Statement:  We are committed to motivate,
 
empower, challenge, and inspire our students as they 
develop the academic and social/emotional skills they need to excel in school and thrive in life.
 
 
Dexter's Vision Statement: In partnership with our families and the community at large, we, at Dexter M
iddle School are 
committed to developing students who are literate across the curriculum, able to think critically, read deeply, and write 
meaningfully about their learning, both as it relates to school and the larger, global context. In our rapidly changi
ng world, 
we use technology as the vehicle through which students will create, collaborate, and communicate. At the core of our 
work is a commitment to building lasting relationships with students and empower them to voice their opinions and be 
heard, as t
hey are the cornerstone of our community.
 
 
Dexter Middle School services 875 students, in grades 6 
-
 
8, 93% of these students are Latino/Hispanic and the remaining 
7% is comprised of African American, White, and Asian students. Dexter has recently moved te
achers into teams which 
means that in 7th and 8th grade five teachers share roughly 150 students and in 6th grade two teachers share roughly 60 
students. This change has allowed our teachers to deeply know their students and designed instruction that has b
een 
crafted to meet student needs. Dexter's teachers and staff work tirelessly to improve student achievement and continually 
monitor student progress through the use of Smarter Balanced Assessments. The results of these assessments are used 
to reflect upo
n student progress and plan additional instruction, including remediation and extension, where appropriate.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
November 2018
 
 

practices are designed to ensure that each student has access to standards based 

materials aligned with the State Standards. Current
ly, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, which includes 

hool is using College Preparatory Math (CPM). 

Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teacher
s in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to suppo
rt the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades
 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in 
place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 


classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic sub
jects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materia
ls for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examin
e, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 

ials as well 
to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

Parent 
involvement in the middle years is critical to a child's success at school.  Dexter offers several ways parents can 
participate including School Site Council, Parent Faculty Organization and the English Learner Advisory Committee; PFO, 
SSC and ELAC meet mo
nthly. The School Site Council is comprised of parents, teachers, and other personnel.
 
 
Dexter's website is updated regularly and provides information for to parents on a 24 hour basis.  The current calendar is 
available and links to many resources are pro
vided.  Dexter's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram Pages are updated regularly 
to provide information and pictures for parents, students, and the entire Dexter community.
 
 
Parent/Family Nights are hosted by the school which provide an opportunity for parent
s, students, and staff members to 
be actively involved.  Examples of our family events are Chorus, Band, and Drama performances.  Dexter also has a robust 
athletics program which parents support.
 
 
Additionally, in our efforts to maintain open lines of comm
unication with parents, monthly publications are made available 
to parents, entitled, The Middle Years and Reading Connections.
 
 
Other methods of daily communication with parents include full implementation of the automated telephone system, 
student planne
rs and telephone calls regarding student progress, 'good news' calls, absences, and tardies.  In addition, 

 
 
The automated telephone system al
lows for broadcast calls (information such as reminders for activities/events and/or 
emergencies), specific student information calls (positive, need to improve, grades, upcoming test, etc.) and attendance 
calls.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Dexter School provides a safe and clean facility for its students. In order to ensure the safety of 
students, a number of 
special programs have been instituted.  Dexter School has a well
-
organized disaster preparedness program which includes 
emergency supplies. The entire staff is a member of a safety team which completes various tasks.  The safety plan 
was 
reviewed, updated and discussed with the faculty at the Opening Staff Meeting on August 12, 2019. We continuously 
revisit and update our school plan as we practice our drills throughout the year.
 
 
Finally, a strong partnership exists between our school
 
and local law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies provide 
ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel in case of a campus or neighborhood 
threat.
 
 
Monthly drills are held throughout the year to ensure that staf
f and students are prepared in the event of an emergency 
(ensuring that students know how to respond to potential emergency situations in the school setting).
 
 
A full
-
time health clerk, trained in first aid, assists students in the event of minor injury as
 
well as with routine health 
issues.
 
 
Additionally, a strong partnership exists between Dexter School and the Whittier Police Department.  The Police 
Department provides support to the school whenever law enforcement assistance is needed. 
Furthermore Whittier PD is 
coordinating with the school in case of a campus or neighborhood threat.
 
 
The facilities at Dexter School are in good condition.  Several years ago, Dexter School received a 1.5 million dollar 
remodeling grant from the State of C
alifornia. Presently there are 47 classrooms including a band room. Additionally, a 
library, computer lab, locker
-
rooms/weight room, and cafeteria constitute the school buildings. The school also has a 
blacktopped area, tennis courts, walking track, and pl
aying fields where recreational equipment is available.
 
 
A regular supervision plan is in use whenever students are out of class. A strict graffiti removal program ensures that 
should graffiti occur, it is removed within a few hours of being sighted. Any v
andalism repairs are completed within 24 
hours.
