School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
Barnett Elementary School opened in September 1992. Nestled among the oaks in the center of a 
residential neighborhood, the site was designed to complement the natural surroundings and 
provide a beautiful setting for learning. Just over 500 students attend
 
Barnett and range in grade 
from transitional kindergarten to sixth. The students represent varying demographic groups 
including significant populations of White, Hispanic, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged students, 
and smaller subgroups of Students with Di
sabilities and English Learners.
 
 
With a wide variety of backgrounds and learning needs, teaching and learning have never been 
more challenging or exciting than today in our classrooms. At Barnett, we are focused on 
implementing the most effective, researc
h
-
based best practices to inspire independent learners 
and critical thinkers. A commitment to the district
-
wide instructional goal guides our work:
 
 

based speak

 
 
Barnett Bobcats are on the learning path to become self
-
regulated learners who know and 

learned it well. The 
California Content Standards include knowledge and skills needed for students 
to graduate college and be career
-
ready. More emphasis is placed on teaching and learning higher 
level skills and we regularly check progress to ensure our students are moving to
wards their 


Learning is hard work and we understand that when we are 
challenged to think, we learn and grow. 
We employ several strategies where research shows increased student achievement when 
students can articulate the learning intentions, use success criteria to determine how well they are 
learning, and determine their 
place in the learning continuum to define next steps. In addition, 
teachers work with students to set personal goals for their learning and are providing specific 
instruction and learning activities on a daily basis.
 
 
Teacher collaboration is a critical st
rategy in planning for rigorous work and creating systems to 
support all students in their learning. With positive feedback from district administration, Barnett 
PTA, and our School Site Council, Barnett continues in its vision of regular teacher collabora
tion in 
support of student learning through a weekly Compact Day. Instructional minutes are strategically 
divided throughout the week extending the school day four days a week and dismissing students 
earlier on the Compact Day.

Parents provide critical support for student learni
ng at Barnett. We are fortunate to have so many parents volunteering to support 
students in the classroom, but also coordinating many fun activities and programs for our students and their families. The sc
hool boasts 
a PTA enrollment of over 200 members an
d sponsors events and activities that include art instruction and docents for all classes, an after 
school running club, parent/child dances and events, holiday family events, art and science nights, school plays, and educati
onal 
assemblies. Their fundrais
ing events earn funds to support those activities and provide the school with resources like technology, 
instructional supplies, and playground equipment to enhance our learning environment. School Site Council parent representati
ves 
provide input and moni
tor our site plan for student achievement. Additionally, some of our parents attend community meetings to 
represent the interests of our children in community planning that may impact our school.
 
 
Parents and teachers work together in support of learning a
t Barnett. When we each take responsibility in our partnership, our children 
benefit with a clear, consistent message and support system for their learning. We commit to strong collaboration as that bin

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data re
ported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

ts, parent organizations, and 
in classrooms) and at the district level (for example, district councils/committees,
 
and special events). We encourage parents to support their children at 
home by making school a priority, sharing clear expectations about school, and creating a positive homework and learning envi
ronment.
 
 
Barnett Elementary School offers many opportuniti

or more parents are on campus providing support to the school. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is open to all parents, l
egal guardians, and relatives 
o
f a child attending Barnett, as well as all faculty and staff. The objective of the PTA is to support academic achievement fo
r Barnett students through 
enrichment programs that enhance academics and citizenship. PTA's success helps to support many school w
ide programs, including Art, Red Ribbon 
Week Events, computer lab and PE equipment, classroom materials, all of which provide opportunities for parent involvement. O
ther opportunities 
encompass volunteering in the classrooms, media center, and the computer
 
lab. School Site Council (SSC), composed of elected parents and staff, meets 
regularly overseeing the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and expenditure of grant and categorical monies. Barnett 
is committed to strong 
collaboration with parents, as
 
that binds us together as a learning community.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Barnett Elementary School places a strong emphasis on the safety of students and staff. The emergency plans are frequently re
viewed by teachers, staff, 
and parents to ensure that they reflect
 
the latest research and best safety practices. The last comprehensive review of the plan was in Spring 2018. This 
committee works to identify potential safety hazards and create a workable Disaster Plan. Annual training on procedures and d
rills for intrud
ers, fire, bus 
evacuation, and earthquakes are held at a variety of times and circumstances to help ensure that everyone on campus knows wha
t to do under any 
circumstance. Fire drills are conducted on a monthly basis and each classroom has backpacks and bu
ckets containing items necessary in the event of an 
emergency. All who visit our campus are required to check in at the office and wear a visitor badge for easy identification. 
All staff wear school ID badges 
as well. Principal, secretaries, health clerk, 
lead custodian and campus safety officers all carry walkie
-
talkies for immediate communication.

Types of Services Funded
 
We believe all students can learn, and we recognize that all students learn and retain information in different ways. For stu
dents with differing learning 
styles or disabilities, RUSD has a wide variety of intervention programs. The District provides regul
ar education, categorical programs and additional 
educational opportunities designed to help all students meet or exceed grade
-
level standards and to prevent students from falling behind. Federal 
categorical and additional educational opportunities are fun
ded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was reauthorized in 2015 
as the Every Student Succeeds Act. These programs include, Title I (English Language Arts and Mathematics support); Title II 
(Improving Teacher Quality); 
Title III (supp
ort for English Language Acquisition and improving Family Engagement); Title IV (support for elementary music and PE and seco
ndary 
technology and vaping cessation). State funding provides supplemental dollars so the District can provide additional service 
to unduplicated count 
students, including foster youth, English language learners, homeless youth, and students of low income families. RUSD offers
 
a wide variety of alternative 
education programs and settings, including the Ramona Community Campus which h
ouses the Ramona Community Montessori School (TK
-
6) and Mt. 
Valley Academy (TK
-
12 School/Independent Study); Future Bound (7
-
12 off campus Independent Study); and Montecito Continuation High School (9
-

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at
 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovide
s reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are p
ublicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that 
a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the abi
lity to print 
documents.
