By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

supports to b
e successful receive instructional supports and assistance as needed. Students who have mastered the 
content being studied are provided with opportunities to extend their learning. Student and staff needs are aligned with 
the appropriate materials, trainin
g, and resources necessary for success. School staff has established and maintains a 
learning environment in which student academic and behavioral expectations are clearly articulated. Positive Behavior 
Intervention Strategies (PBIS) are used to support st
udent behavior and social
-
emotional health.
 
 
Linda Vista Elementary School is extremely fortunate to have an involved and supportive parent community. Parents and 
community members are involved in the school in a variety of formal and informal ways. Parent
s can serve on several 
committees, including the School Site Council (SSC), the English Language Acquisition Committee (ELAC), and the Parent
-

support the instructional program. The Linda Vista school community works hard to nurture an environment that is caring, 
supportive, and positive, with the goal of maximizing student achievement. The PTA brings special programs to the school 
such as A

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The staff at Linda Vista welcomes and encourages parent and community involvement. The PTA is an integral part of the 
ongoing instructional program. They provide supplemental programs such as Art Masters, Science
-
on
-
the
-
Go, and 
monthly music instruction, a
s well as supporting the implementation of technology to enhance the curriculum. Parents 
are encouraged to participate in the instructional program by volunteering in classrooms and at school/community events 
and activities. Linda Vista parents are knowled
geable, informed, and have high expectations.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to be partners in their children's education in formal and informal ways. Examples of formal 
involvement include opportunities to serve as elected representatives on the Linda Vista 
School Site Council (SSC), 
composed of equal numbers of staff and parents. The SSC provides input into the development of the school's annual 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) and approves Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) State funding for sta
ff 
development, supplemental educational materials, and additional staff support. The School Site Council meets a minimum 
of five times per year and all interested parents are invited to attend these meetings. In addition, Linda Vista's English 
Learner Adv
isory Committee (ELAC) meets several times throughout the school year and its members consist primarily of 
parents of English Learner (EL) students. The ELAC provides input about the instructional program and ways to support 
English Learners at the school.
 
 
Parents are always welcome to volunteer and involve themselves in the life of Linda Vista.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

accordance with Education Code § 32280 

 
32289. This plan is updated and reviewed with parents, community members,
 
and staff on an annual basis. The plans for each District school are kept on file in the office of Student and Community 
Services at the District office.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. 
All schools in the 
District are linked through an emergency radio contact system, and District radio drills are held periodically to ensure 
preparedness in case of an actual disaster. Providing a safe environment for our students is of paramount concern at
 
Linda 
Vista. The Fire Marshal inspects the school annually to verify that Linda Vista meets both every day and emergency 
standards. Linda Vista's certificated and classified staff have been assigned to specific disaster teams and have been 
instructed as t
o the duties they are to carry out in the event of an emergency. These teams include: Command Center, 
Sweep and Rescue, First Aid, Student Assembly Area, Student Release, Site Security, and Psychological Services.

During the most recent three years (2016
-
2019), Linda Vista Elementary School teachers and staff have participated in 
District
-
wide and site
-
specific professional development. Teachers have received professional development training in all 
curricular areas
. This includes the District
-
adopted English Language Arts program (Wonders); writing program (Write 
From the Beginning...and Beyond), reading (DIBELS Next), Envision Mathematics, Common Core State Standards, and ELD. 
In addition, teachers have participate
d in technology classes individually and as a group, including iTeach and BYOD 
programs, iLearn, and eBadge programs. Teachers have also participated in training in GATE, CAASPP administration, and 
instructional strategies (e.g., GLAD, Thinking Maps, behav
ior and classroom management, etc.).Classified staff and 
teachers have also attended professional development training for special education (including autism and 
compliance/legal issues) as well as safety (AED/CPR training, emergency preparedness).
 
 
Profe
ssional development training has been conducted at the site level monthly as site and in collaboration with teachers 
from Villa Park and Serrano Elementary Schools to support grade level collaboration across schools, as well as with 
teachers and staff from
 
across the District. Teachers have also participated in training with their grade level colleagues or 
individually as needed.
 
 
The format for trainings varies depending on the content and program in which the training is being conducted. Teachers 
attend o
ne site level training with other Linda Vista teaching staff at least once each month, and join with their colleagues 
from Serrano and Villa Park Elementary Schools throughout the year. Some trainings are ongoing and teachers meet with 
colleagues from acro
ss the District every month, while most self
-
selected sessions are done on an as needed basis and are 
usually one
-
time sessions. The majority of the training sessions are taught in after school workshops and often use 
restructured Wednesdays to provide tra
ining within the teachers' contract day.
 
 
Teachers are supported during the training and implementation of what is learned through curricular specialist and/or 
principal coaching, peer mentoring, and with the assistance of District personnel working 
directly with individual or small 
groups of teachers.
