School Description
 
We are a 6th through 8th grade Title 1 school. Our goal is to 
improve student learning through the 
use of effective teaching strategies and best practices developed through collaboration 
opportunities and staff professional development. Our dedicated staff focuses on building strong 
connections and relationships with
 
our students to support student learning. We believe that all 
students will excel when academic excellence is expected, expectations are consistent and taught 
regularly, and enrichment and supports are provided to engage and support learning academically 
and socially to prepare them for high school and beyond.
 
 
We have partnerships with community agencies to provide social emotional support and learning 
for students, college and career learning opportunities, and field trips that allow students to explor
e 
our local colleges. Through our electives and curriculum, students are exposed to and explore 
STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics). Our 8th grade leadership club 
also provides students with opportunities to create student rallies
, develop spirit weeks, run food 
drives, and much more.
 
 
Our vision is to have students...

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent w
ith data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal 
or the district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

appropriate, individualized instruction to students with special needs

Special Projects: any monies from agencies (federal or state) earmarked for specific programs, projects or services
 
Each school receives an ins
tructional budget based on enrollment, programs, and formulas set by Board of Education policy, state law, agreements with 
bargaining units, and guidelines of outside funding sources. The School Site Council (SSC) meets approximately once a month t
o develo

well as the District Advisory Committee (DAC) meetings, as a way to learn more about our school funding and academic goals.
