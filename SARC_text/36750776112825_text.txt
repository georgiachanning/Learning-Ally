Student Achievement:
 
To ensure student achi
evement, our curriculum is aligned with state standards and is assessed and monitored frequently.  Student 
Achievement is monitored by staff throughout the school year.  iReady Reading and Math tests and Reading Records are administ
ered 
during the school y

-
risk students and student 
study team meetings are held as appropriate.   Students in third through sixth grade also participate in the California Asses

By law (California Education Code Section 60800), all public local educational agencies in California are required to adminis
ter the Physical 
Fitness Test (PFT) annually to all students in fifth grade.  
The PFT was administered to our students in the Spring of 2019.  We had a 
participation rate of 98%.  The PFT assesses each student to their level of health
-
related fitness.   Parents and guardians understand their 

report stating the results of their student's test. This allows teachers, parents, and guardians to 
monitor changes in the student's fitness levels.  The PFT scores are available for parents through the Aeries Parent Portal.
 
 
Objectives include:
 
1.
 
Increase s
tudent achievement in reading, math, and science.
 
2.
 

 
3.
 
Effectively diagnose student needs and provide appropriate interventions.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.

r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
