By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Louisiana Schnell School is one of three schools in the Placerville Union School District.  Both Schnell and Sierra Schools 
serve Transitional Kindergarten
-
5 grade students; Edwin Markham Middle School serves all 6
-
8th grade students.   Our 

 
 
Schnell School has a wide variety of programs designed to meet the unique needs of students.  Now in its first year, Schn
ell 
School is the host site for the Spanish
-
English Dual Immersion Language Program for the Placerville Union School District.  
This program seeks to create bi
-
literate (read, write, speak, and think) students using a 90/10 language model.  The 
program wil
l be K
-
5 at it's maturity.  Currently the program serves a kindergarten class and will grow each year as students 
progress.  Schnell is also fortunate to be an AVID Elementary School.  AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) 
is a program designed t
o create the academic rigor and campus climate necessary for students, who may not otherwise 
consider college as an option, to be successful in college, career, and beyond.  Social
-
Emotional learning is an important 
aspect off a child's elementary school e
xperience.  At Schnell we employ a full time School Counselor and utilize the Second 
Step program to ensure that students have opportunities to grow in this area.
 
 

 
 
Students First!   
-
  
Preparing all students for future success through quality instruction today.  We believe firmly that we 
have a tremendous and important work in preparing our students to be successful now and in their futures.  We employ 
several system
s to aide in helping students to be successful.  All students have access to quality instruction from a highly 
qualified and credentialed teacher as well as ongoing and fluid differentiation and intervention to meet the needs of 
students.
 
 
Schnell School i
s in it's 2nd year of AVID Elementary implementation (Advancement Via Individual Determination).  
Teachers receive robust and ongoing professional development from certified AVID trainers to ensure that our program 
is great for students.  AVID seeks to pro
vide structures for students that ensure every child can be college and career 
ready.  This year we have three main goals in our AVID program: create a college going climate and culture, creating 
opportunities in classrooms for conversations that yield hig
her level thinking, and a school
-
wide emphasis on Growth 
Mindset.
 
 
Schnell School is in its first year of Spanish
-
English Dual Immersion Language Program.  Starting this year in Kindergarten 
we have one class in the program.  Each year we will add a 
class at the next grade level until we have one class per grade 
level in Kindergarten through 5th grade.  Schnell is using a 90%/10% language model for instruction.  Dual Immersion 
programs are research
-
based programs which show great results for all stude
nts.
 
 
Teachers at Schnell School collaborate weekly through Early Release Monday Collaboration time.  This time is a valuable 
way for teams of teachers to examine standards, learning targets, assessments and intervention/enrichment for students.  
Teacher g
rade level teams are a significant part of our school climate.  We as a school know that teams of teachers are far 
more effective in raising student achievement that teachers who work in isolation.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
As a result of the most recently completed school site inspection, our facilities were found to be in good repair status.
 
 
Schnell is very proud to have a well maintained and aesthetically pleasing school campus.  The campus boasts a large 
amount o
f grass, trees, and natural elements which make it enjoyable for all who enter.  Our physical school buildings are 
in very good repair and maintained at the time that issues may arise.
 
 
Schnell continues to seek ways to improve parking lot lighting for sta
ff and guests.  Placerville can be quite warm during 
the late summer months and our school continues to seek ways to provide shade on and over playground areas.  Parking 
is adequate at our campus but could be expanded through additional paving to create a 
staff parking area which would 
free up many parking stalls for guests.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

There are 
frequent and ongoing opportunities for parents and the community to be involved with Schnell School.  Our 
School welcomes parents to be involved on and off of our campus in a variety of ways.  The Parent Teacher Club is active 
on the school campus. The PTC
 
meets monthly on the first Thursday of every month. The PTC sponsors many activities 
and fundraisers for the students and school. Each classroom has garden parents that work with small classroom groups in 
the award winning school garden.  Additionally, we
 
welcome parents to work in the classrooms as parent helpers. Many 
parents enjoy meeting on our campus before and after school to socialize and to watch their children interact and play on 
our park like school campus. Parents of English Learners serve on o
ur Schnell English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).   
In addition, parents serve on the District Health Education Advisory Committee (HEAC), Superintendent's Parent Advisory 
Council as well as the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).   Sc
hnell School also has a part time Parent 
Liaison who conducts outreach to parents, provides support to parents and apprises parents about opportunities for 
parent involvement.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school site safety plan is updated on an annual basis with the input from staff, parents, and School Site Council. The 
staff reviews and is trained on the school safety plan each year before the school year begins. The El Dorado County Fire 
Protection 
District completes an annual audit of our school safety plan, and works with the school to have a complete and 
comprehensive plan. We practice lock
-
down drills, fire drills and bus evaluation drills throughout the school year. Our 
School Site Council and A
nnual Parent Survey asks questions and seeks input from staff and families about school safety; 
this information is vital in providing ideas which have led to safe campus for students, staff, parents and guests.
 
 
Schnell prides itself on creating a climate
 
for learning that promotes a safe, orderly, and positive feel on our campus.  
Parents indicate that the are highly pleased with the safety procedures on or campus.  Parents also indicate that the 
campus is free of crime, vandalism and has a safe appearanc
e.  The custodial and maintenance workers are constantly 
looking for improvements and repairs that will make our campus a place that students, staff, parents and guests feel safe.

The teachers develop goals each and every year based on student testing results, Parent Survey results, California Healthy 
Kids Survey (CHKS) and Governing Board goals. The district calendar has Early Release 
scheduled every Monday. The Early 
Release days are used for teacher and staff professional development as well as team planning. We use data driven results 
to base decisions to decide future staff development needs. Teachers attend workshops and attend con
ferences to 
improve classroom instruction. Grade level teams share  information and work together to provide improved instruction.  
The Placerville School District employs Grade Level Teacher Leaders who are of great assistance to teachers with classroom 
c
oaching and staff development.    Also, teachers are receiving ongoing training In Project G.L.A.D. ( Guided Language 
Acquisition Design) strategies which provides professional development in the areas of language acquisition and literacy.
