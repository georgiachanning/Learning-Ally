By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mission:
 
In partnership with our community, Lampson Elementary offers a learning environment of excellence, with high 
expectations, to provide our students with the opportunity to be responsi
ble, resilient, and productive world citizens in a 
changing and diverse society.  Lampson Elementary strives to develop student literacy across all content areas as a 
foundation to inspire each of our students to pursue their dreams and develop into tomorr

Lampson Elementary, a Professional Learning Community, will collaboratively examine and analyze student data to guide 
our instruction leading to continual increased student achievement.
 
 
Vision:
 
Fostering critical thinkers today to
 
solve tomorrow's challenges.
 
 
Lampson Elementary is one of  the 27 elementary schools in the Orange Unified School District.  The school was built in 
1963.  It is the only Orange Unified school located in Garden Grove, approximately one
-
mile north of the 
22 freeway 
between Haster and Lewis Streets.
 
 
At this time, approximately 800 students are enrolled in Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grades.  Lampson also has 
4 pre
-
school classes. Lampson operates on a modified
-
traditional Calendar divided into 
trimesters. The enrollment 
breakdown by ethnicity: 80% Hispanic/Latino, 10% Asian, 10% other.  Lampson is a full
-
inclusion Title I school with a low 
SES population of 80%. 57% of the students are classified as English Language Learners.
 
 
Examples of programs designed to support a positive learning environment include: a school
-
wide uniform policy for all 
students, the Multi
-
tiered System of Support, and school
-
wide behavior incentives designed to recognize positive 
behaviors.  Lampson Elem
entary has also adopted the PBIS model and implemented our P.A.W.S. motto.  This school
-
wide 
positive behavior program will help students define positive ways to behave and interact with their classmates, teachers, 
and their community.  Our P.A.W.S. motto 
reflects values and conduct that are essential for students to be successful in 
our 21st Century global economy and be productive global citizens.  Each letter of the P.A.W.S. acronym represents a 
behavior expectation that students will follow here at Lamp
son: P 

 
Practice respect; A 

 
Accept responsibility; W 

 
Work 
hard; S 

 
Safety matters.  These behavior expectations are also supported by a P.A.W.S. Matrix which explicitly states how 
each of these behavior expectations should be modeled by students at s
ix locations within the school: Classrooms, Lunch 
Area, Hallways, Playground, Restrooms, and at Assemblies.  These behavior expectations are then reinforced by positive 
incentives and rewards which assist students in rapidly internalizing these expectation
s and progressive discipline 
practices which aim to teach student the correct way to behave.  This system of school
-
wide positive behavior 

s 
Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) which aims to support the whole child both behaviorally and academically.  Our 
goal is to support and enhance student achievement and safety through P.A.W.S. These behavior expectations are also 
supported by a PAWS M
atrix and are reinforced by our PAWS signs which explicitly state how each of these behavior 
expectations should be modeled by students at different locations within the school: Classrooms, Lunch Area, Hallways, 
Playground, Restrooms, STEAM Labs, and Assem
blies. We have a PAWS Rewards System, in which students earn PAWS 
tickets for exemplifying our behavior expectations. PAWS tickets can be redeemed for prizes.

Lampson was modernized during the 2008
-
09 school year.  The new rooms currently have new air conditioning and 
heating, LCD projectors mounted on the ceiling.  We

ties is completed followed by work orders if needed.  
Inspection reports are kept on file, in order to check on completion and progress of projects.  District maintenance crews 
maintain the gardening of Lampson on a regular basis.
 
 
We have four gates at 
Lampson: one gate next to the kindergarten playground, one main gate next to the office, one gate 
next to the library, and another gate in the back next to the parking lot.  All gates open at 7:40am.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Lampson 
Elementary School all staff are encouraged to present a customer service attitude.  Throughout the school 
year many opportunities are provided for parents to become involved in their child's education.
 
 
At Lampson, three major parent/community involvement 
groups bring parents, staff, teachers, and community members 
together to plan and monitor school programs.  The English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) is a representation of 
the staff and parents of English learners at Lampson. The work done by this co
mmittee is focused on monitoring and 
reflecting on school programs (academic, social emotional) for EL students. Through participation on this committee 
parents are able to educate themselves about instruction and services offered to their English learning
 
students. They 
provide input regarding the implementation of instructional programs.  The School Site Council (SSC) brings together 
teachers, staff, parents and interested community members to advise, plan, and approve the school plan and budget 
expenditu
res. This council works together using various forms of data to monitor progress in meeting grade level outcomes 
and proficiency targets.  The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) also plays an important role in supporting the academic 
and social emotional goa
ls of Lampson.  They provide input regarding the school plan and help support the academic

Lampson was 1 of 3 Orange County schools, 1 of 21 
California schools, and 1 of 326 U.S. Schools to receive this award. The 
National PTA School of Excellence is a recognition program that supports and celebrates partnerships between PTAs and 
schools to enrich the educational experience and overall well
-
bei
ng for all students. We are so thankful for their passion 
and commitment to Lampson.
 
 
An interpreter is available at all parent meetings for those requiring this service.  Parent workshops are offered based 
upon surveys completed by parents and by asking p
arents what would meet their needs. Throughout the year, the school 
provides many opportunities for parents to be involved with the school through our annual STEAM Night, Literacy Night, 
Career Day, Astronomy Night, Movie Nights, classroom volunteering, as
 
so much more.
 
 
Parents, school staff, and community members are provided multiple opportunities through these committee 
opportunities to provide feedback about the 8 state priorities and how to implement them at Lampson Elementary School. 
They are provide
d with the LCAP Survey and this feedback is used to evaluate the needs of our school.  The School Site 
Council then uses this information to ensure that these priorities are included in our school plan.  A school climate survey 
will be provided to parents 
and students.  This information will be used to determine ways to improve our school climate 
to create a learning environment that is safe and nurturing.
 
 
Teachers maintain regular communication with parents through daily and/or weekly reports, phone calls
, and homework 
logs.  Parents may request a conference at any time during the school year.  All parents receive communication in writing, 
via phone calls or emails throughout the year.  Parents are given the Title I Parent Involvement Compact and the guide
lines 
for visiting the school or for volunteering.
 
 
Community engagement and business partnerships is encouraged year
-
long at Lampson Elementary school. Current 
business and community partners are invited each year to continue participating and new busines
ses are recruited as well.
 
 
In an effort to support parent engagement at Lampson, school to home communications are in English and Spanish.  Our 
school community liaison regularly make phone calls to parents and acts as a bridge between school and home.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed and if 
necessary, update
d their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the Office of 
Student and Community Service. The  Office of Student and Community Service provides assistance to schools and 
maintains a file of individual school s
afety plans which are available for inspection by the public. Lampson keeps a copy of 
the school safety plan in the main office for any parent or community member to review.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are 
conducted monthly.  Lockdown drills are 
conducted quarterly.  All schools in the district are linked through an emergency radio contact system and district radio 
drills are held periodically to be prepared in case of an actual disaster.  Four noon duty sup
ervisors, who work diligently 
to maintain a safe and organized playground, supervise our school lunch program under the direct supervision of the 
school principal and assistant principal.   Administration meets with these supervisors regularly to monitor c
oncerns and 
changes to the duty and safety plan.  In compliance with SB187, the safety committee has prepared a Safe Schools Plan, 
which is (on file) in the school office and is available upon request.  Providing a safe environment for our students is of 
p
aramount concern at Lampson.  Classroom maps are updated to reflect proper evacuation routes and procedures.  Copies 
of the School Safety plan are available to all staff members and in the main office.  Local law enforcement and fire 
personnel participate 
in monthly practice drills and ongoing improvements are made to our safety plan.

Problem of Practice, and school vision.  Student achievement data will continue to drive our professional development to 
ensure that we are implementing instructional strategies that enhance student learning and increase instructional rigor 
and critic
al thinking in our students.  Our Instructional Specialist, Resource Teachers, and Instructional Leadership Team 
will continue to provide our staff with focused professional development.  Reflection, in alignment with the Collaborative 
Cycle of Effective I

Teachers participate in grade level Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) and grade level planning with our 
Instructional Specialist throughout the school year for the purpose of increasing student achievement.  In PLCs, teachers 
spend a significant amo
unt of time analyzing data and looking at student work samples to engage in reflective 
conversations about their overall impact on student learning.  During PLC time, teachers keep minutes of the data 
analyzed, actions discussed, and future steps.  Teacher
s ensure ample time is spent reflecting on the academic progress 
of significant subgroups including English Learners and other At
-
Risk Students. The purpose of focusing on these subgroups 
is to ensure these students are provided full access to the curricul
um to positively impact their overall academic 
achievement and social

emotional development.
