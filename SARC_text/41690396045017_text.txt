About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees
 
has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bond to rep
air, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. A lunch shade 
structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added, student classroom furniture was replaced, ext
erior painting was completed and perimeter 
fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at Abbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bayside 
Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City. Sunnybrae Elementary is part of Phase II in which addi
tional 
classrooms and a Multi
-
Purpose Room will be added to the school.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 
2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis to 
assist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the sc
hool in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box"
 
is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are
 
given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner, the maintenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed wit
h at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal
, along with the main
tenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows t

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility sur
vey instrument developed by the State of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site.

School Safety Plan
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City District Handbook, updated each school year, 

creating a safe and caring school community where all students and families feel welcomed, valued and respected. These Guidin
g Principles (respect, 
responsibility, appreciation of
 
differences, honesty, safety and life
-
long learning) communicate the expectations for behavior to students, parents, 
teachers and administrators and are updated and reviewed yearly. The rules were developed to be consistent with State Educati
on Code, poli
cies of the 
San Mateo
-
Foster City School District Board of Trustees and the School District's Strategic Plan.
 
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plans, developed individually for each school in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of 
Education and City 
S
ervices, include disaster preparedness and emergency procedures. The School Safety Plans provide role responsibility guidelin
es and processes required 
to address major emergencies. Annually, the District utilizes the services of School Innovations & Achiev

determine if all required components are included and to offer feedback and suggestions.
 
 
California Education Code Section 32280 requires school fire evacuation drills, as well as one law enforcement lockdown d
rill, and the District organizes 
two District
-
wide drills each year, using different scenarios that test the Big Five Safety Protocols (Shelter in Place, Secure Campus, Dr
op, Cover and Hold 
On, Lockdown/Barricade and Evacuation). These drills involve a Dis
trict Command Center for communication with each school/program site and full 
emergency set

up. As a District collaborating with San Mateo County and the San Mateo County Office of Education, we participate yearly in 
Big Five 
training for staff.

Professional 
Development
 
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training 
is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during
 
the school year, on early release days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the
 
implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Languag
e Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economica
lly Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research from the
 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
angua
ge and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards
 
and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of
 
Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learning communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training 
with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed profession
al learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immedi
ate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and feedback surveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strate
gies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional 
growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for
 
student successes and
 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then informs the distr

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more spec
ific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District lea
ders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union representatives to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the dist
rict LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this y
ear, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teache
rs also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
