Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Mission of Pivot Charter Schools is to instruct students in grades TK
-
12 through a rigorous online educational platform 
supported by site based class offerings and individualized attention. The 
unique educational program coupled with flexible 
scheduling and a caring environment provides students the skills, confidence and motivation to lead a successful and 
productive life in the 21st century.
 
 
Pivot Charter School offers a unique and customized 
tuition
-
 
free public education for students in grades TK
-
12. Our 
program allows students to access their courses from the comfort of their own home or from our safe and welcoming 
resource centers five days a week; Pivot is truly a Blended Learning Program.
 
The 6th through 12th grade students at Pivot 
Charter Schools come from a wide range of backgrounds. They come for advanced placement courses, flexibility in 
scheduling, one
-
on
-
one attention, small group learning, to make up credits and to graduate early a
s well as to take college 
courses. The diversity of our student body is one of the things that makes the Pivot experience unique. Our TK
-
5 program 
offers hands on projects as well as tutoring and arts. The TK
-
5 program utilizes the highly acclaimed, Compas
s Learning 
online curriculum with additional supplemental materials coupled with the support, guidance tutoring and site
-
based 
classes provided by a CA
-
credentialed teacher. In the Pivot elementary program, parents assume a key role in overseeing 
the educa
tion of their student. Using Pivot educational resources, and supported by CA
-
credentialed teachers, students 
in the elementary program will progress at a level that is commensurate with their abilities.
 
 
Pivot Charter Schools recognize that 
students working online and in independent study must have a significant level of 
independence or support at home in order to be successful. And not all students have that self
-
motivation, support or 
independence. Therefore, Pivot has developed onsite prog
rams to support those students in meeting their educational 
goals using the online curriculum. Students in grades 6
-
12 can participate in electives such as learning lab, music, 
journalism, science lab, Spanish, and PE at most sites. Every campus offers wee
kly Fun Fridays and field trips. 
 
 
PIVOT CHARTER SCHOOLS IS FOUNDED IN THE FOLLOWING CORE BELIEFS: 
 

 
Successful schools are student centered, not adult centered.
 

 

 

 

frequent, supportive yet motivating communication with students.
 

 

 

 
Schools must show how much they care about students.
 

 
Educators should have warrior s

 

 
Education needs to provide more options, not less.
 

 
The goal is that students learn; how we get there should be as unique as every student.
 

 
Technology is our friend and should play a c
rucial role in educating students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pivot Charter S
chool North Bay is an independent study Charter School and not required to complete the FIT but the 
facility works with a management company that responds to any repair requests, they also oversee the regular outside 
grounds maintenance, cleaning services 
for the bathrooms and common hallway areas shared by all tenants, and quarterly 
air
-
duct filter cleaning for the entire building. The Pivot Site Coordinator and the Site Administrator in North Bay have 
been overseeing repairs and maintenance specific to ou
r tenancy such as changing light bulbs, small repairs, carpet 
maintenance, and regular biweekly cleaning. All building improvements have been thoroughly inspected and approved by 
the City of Santa Rosa.  Upon doing our own facilities inspection we report t
he following information: the overall 
cleanliness of the site is good, there is no indication of pest or vermin infestation and the doors and windows are all 
working properly and secure.  The staff and students participate in fire drills, earthquake and sh
ooter drills annually.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pu
pil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Califor
nia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate 
achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for ent
rance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Pivot Charter School does not have CTE programs, but we continue to increase the number of CTE courses offered to our 
students (see below).  Our school has a technology requirement (which is a Pivot Charter School requirement)  W
e believe 
this technology requirement is crucial for preparing students for modern careers. We have nothing articulated with local 
colleges at this time but the list of CTE courses is significant.
