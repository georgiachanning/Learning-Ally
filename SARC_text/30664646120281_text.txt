Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

We truly value the importance of this partnership and could no be more proud of the level of involvement from our 
community. In addition to v
olunteering in our classrooms, library, innovation and computer labs, we have a very active 
PTA and LNES Foundation. Parents are represented on our School Site Council (SSC) , AAA Advisory Council, and English 
Language Learner Advisory Council (ELAC). Our 
school staff, PTA, and District provide parent programs to meet the many 
interests of our parent community. These include programs of academic and instructional interest, parenting classes, and 
ELD classes.
 
 
From the District level, the CUSD Family Resourc

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults 
that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovativ
e educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning environments includ
e Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
w
ide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

lemental training during the summer and after 
school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase 
student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide 
specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impac
t of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goa
ls based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines pr
iorities for teacher training and implementation.

Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative ass
essment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ze Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help pre
pare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists 
new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing and meets the re

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, st
udent study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
