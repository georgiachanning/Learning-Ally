School Description
 
Mission Statement:  Foresthill Union School District will provide outstanding instruction and 
meaningful experiences to enable all 
students to reach their full potential in a safe, supportive 
environment.
 
 
Foresthill Divide School provides education to students in grades TK
-
8th and is home to 
approximately 420 students. Foresthill Divide School is nestled in the Foothills of Northern 
California. Our community is filled with many active members and many different social clubs 
including the Lions Club, American Legion, and multiple others. However, many business in the 
community have had to leave our town. FDS offers after school interve
ntion programs for students 
struggling academically, multiple sports throughout the year (basketball, volleyball, track, cross 
country, and soccer) and Intervention/Enrichment for 6
-
8th grade students.  We work closely with 
Foresthill High School and provi
de multiple opportunities for our students and staff to get together 
and create opportunities for all students. Foresthill Divide School continues to pursue excellence in 
education by providing the most up to date technology, curriculum and professional de
velopment 
for staff.
 
 
Parents are always welcome at our school and many volunteer opportunities are available. The 
School Site Council, with 50% of its seats reserved for parents, makes decisions regarding the 

egorical programs and budget. Parental involvement 

meetings and provides many opportunities to assist students and staff, including fundraising and 
school/communit
y events.  Our goal at FUSD is to continue to meet the needs of all of our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

of textbooks for the 2019

2020 school year were 
conducted in November 2019, and determined that the school within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, ins

used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a rec
ommendation
 
is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available fo
r parent examination 
at the district office prior to adoption. The  table  displays  information  collected  in  the 20

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
This school has 22 classrooms 
including a library, gym/multi
-
purpose room, and an administration building.  Portables have been added to the campus 
periodically to accommodate growth.  Safety is a priority at Foresthill Divide School.  Signs posted throughout the campus re
quire all vis
itors to register 
with identification at the school office and obtain a visitor badge or sticker before entering the campus, a policy closely m
onitored by all staff.  Personnel 
supervise students before school (with students allowed on campus at 7:45 a.m.)
, after school and during recesses.  A school
-
wide plan clearly outlines 
expectations for student behavior, and a comprehensive safety plan details staff response to emergencies.
 
 
The school is always in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations per
taining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.  The School 
Site Safety plan is updated annually every fall by the School Safety Committee and reviewed with staff at the start of the sc
hool year.
 
 
Site and District personnel work together to
 
maintain the campus on a daily basis.  Formal inspections are routinely performed to ensure the facilities 
are neat, clean and in good repair.  Major projects and deep cleaning of the buildings are completed during school breaks.  T
he district participate
s in the 
State School Deferred Maintenance Program which assists with expenditures for major repairs or replacement of existing school
 
components.
 
 
A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest pr
iority.
