The purpose of the School Accountability Report Card is to provide parents with 
information about 

and the staff. Parents and community play a very important role in our schools. Understanding our 
educational program, student achievement, 
and curriculum development can assist both our 
school and the community in ongoing program improvement. 
 
 
Oasis is committed to ensure each student learns and receives the education they need. The 
excellent quality of our program is a reflection of our hig
hly committed staff. We are dedicated to 
ensuring that our school provides a welcoming, stimulating environment where students are 

hard work, our students wi
ll be challenged to reach their maximum potential

About the SARC
 
By February 1 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding For
mula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and loc
al priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electroni
c work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Teachers and staff submit requests for uns
cheduled maintenance 
and special projects to the senior custodian or principal; requests 
are evaluated and either assigned to site custodians or a work order is prepared and 

highly qualified, 
professional trade specialis
ts or third party vendors, depending upon the scope of the project. Emergency situations are immediately called in to M&O 

 
 
One full

time evening custodian, and one part
-
time evening custodian are assigned to Oasis Elementary and work closely 
with the principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events. The principal and senior cu
stodian communicate frequently to 
discuss campus cleaning needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the senior custodian inspects campus f
acilities for safety 
hazards, graffiti, or other conditions that require removal prior to student
s and staff entering school grounds. The day custodians are responsible for 
cafeteria setup/cleanup, school activity setups, minor maintenance, outside grounds areas cleaning, sweeping sidewalks, secur
ity checks,and keeping 
restrooms clean and stocked. Res
trooms are monitored and checked by the custodian, teachers, and supervision aides throughout the day as a proactive 
measure in eliminating vandalism and keeping facilities safe, sanitary, and stocked. The evening custodians are responsible f
or general cle
aning of 
classrooms (including sanitizing desktops), restrooms, kitchen, and library. When students are on winter and summer break, cu
stodians perform a 
thorough, detailed cleaning throughout the campus.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
