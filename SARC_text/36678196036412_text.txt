By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sultana School was originally built in 1963. Sultana Elementary has adequate classrooms, staff, and ancillary spaces. The 
school has a total of 42 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, 1 computer lab, 1 science lab a
nd an administration 
building that houses offices and staff facilities. There are 20 portable classrooms that were installed at various times 
between 1996 and 2009. There were no completed or planned facility improvements during the 2018/2019 school year. 
The school has a large field and enough playground equipment for student engagement. There are 9 restrooms. The school 
facility offers a good learning environment with fully functioning lighting, heating, and cooling systems, and noise 
negation. Each teach
er has a school laptop computer. There are 42 classrooms equipped with Smart Boards and all 
classrooms have document cameras and LCD projectors. Internet access is available in the office and all classrooms.
 
 
To promote safety, Sultana Elementary School is
 
a closed campus; gates are closed during the school day and visitors must 
enter through the main office to sign at the front desk prior to entering school premises.  Visitors must present their 
California ID badges and staff must present their district Ba
dge through out RAPTOR system.  Signage has been placed at 
all gates directing visitors to check in at the office.  All staff members have been provided with district ID badges.  Sulta
na 
Elementary School offers student supervision before school, during sc
hool and after school.  Supervision in the mornings 
is done by administrative team, support team, and proctors.  Recess and lunch  duty supervision is offered by our proctors.  
After school supervision is offered by administration team, support staff as we
ll as teachers.
 
 
Sultana School is maintained in a manner that assures it is in good repair and functional. The principal works with the 
custodial staff to make certain a daily cleaning schedule is maintained so classrooms, restrooms and the school grounds
 
remain clean, safe and orderly, and that the floors, walls, and plumbing system are all in good repair. Carpet was replaced 
in 4 of our current classrooms.  Site and district maintenance and grounds staff make sure that the work necessary to keep 
the scho
ol in good repair, in working order and aesthetically pleasing are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is in use to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
The LEA takes great efforts to ensure th
at all schools are clean, safe, and functional. The district Operations Department 
annually conducts an in
-
depth evaluation of each school to determine the condition of the facilities and identify situations 
that need maintenance, repair or an upgrade. To 
assist in this effort, the LEA uses a facility survey instrument developed 
by the State of California OPSC. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the Ontario
-
Montclair 
School District office. During the most recent Facility Co
nditions Evaluation conducted on August 27, 2019, by the County's 
Williams Team, facilities and buildings, rooms, and grounds were found to be in "good repair." The report describes the 
visit as "professional experience with a focus by the entire staff on 
seeking to improve the learning of each student."  There 
were no extreme deficiencies found and one good repair deficiency.  The found good repair deficiency was remedied at 
the time of the inspection as listed on the report.  The good repair was section 9
 
Sinks/Fountains, water pressure was too 
low.  It was followed by the work order #191516.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

We used student achievement data to determine the need for 
professional development in math.  Sultana Elementary 
has provided teachers time to unpack the math curriculum to provide students with the best instruction.  Teachers 
participated in Module studies, Prep and Custom and overall Eureka training for the new 
teachers.  Teachers also 
participated in Balanced Literacy and Data and Assessment planning days in order to look at data and reflect on next steps.  
Learning targets have been a focus of interest for math.  The district TOA has presented professional deve
lopment to the 
entire staff.  Teachers are supported through in class coaching, evaluation process, student performance data reporting, 
training at the district office, and walk through feedback.
