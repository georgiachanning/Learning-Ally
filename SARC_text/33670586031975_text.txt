Kennedy Math &Science Magnet School is required by the state toadminister a physical fitness test to all students in gradefive. The physical fitness test measures each student'sability to complete fitness tasks in six major areas.Students who either meet or exceed the standards in allsix fitness areas are considered to be in the "healthyfitness zone." The chart reported in this document reportsonly the percentage in each category, not a cumulativetotal of the results for categories 4 of 6 and 5 of 6.Comparative district and state results can be found at theCDE's website.

Only eligible studentsmay participate in the administration of the CAAs.  CAAsitems are aligned with alternative achievement standards,which are linked with the Common Core State Standards(CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how wellstudents are mastering California's standards in Englishlanguage arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and aregiven to grades three through eight and grade eleven.SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/Literacyand mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests andperformance tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned withalternative achievement standards which are linked withthe Common Core State Standards (CCSS).The CAASPP results shown in this report include overallresults comparing the school, district and state scores aswell as the school's overall score in each applicablesubgroup. Results are shown only for subgroups with tenstudents or more taking the exam. For those categoriesthat are blank in the tables, no students met subgroupcriteria.
