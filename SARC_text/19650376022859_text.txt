Principal's Message
 
O
ur goal is to provide students with a supportive 
environment, which includes parents and the 
community, as they make the transition from elementary school to high school. We want to 
prepare students academically and socially for success in high school and to prepare students for 
independent and lifelong 
learning. We encourage our kids to set individual goals and make positive 
choices.
 
 
We also have a drama club, a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) class, AVID and 
AVID Excel classes, a Student Government class, band class, art, Study Skills
, Mentors, Culinary Arts 
class, Coding class, a painting class and a concurrent enrollment STEM class with East Los Angeles 
College so our  students have the opportunity to enjoy electives and receive the full middle school 
experience.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the 
school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Each school site has parent representatives who get involved in various district
-
level advisory committees. District
-
level parent involvement opportunities 
i
nclude participation on the District Advisory Committee and the District English Language Learner Advisory Committee. At GMS,
 
parents can become 
active in our School Site Council (SSC), Coffee with the Principal, Back to School and Open House,  Road to Col
lege, and several other Parent workshops 
and activities.  We have parent training opportunities with PIQE Spiritt Family Services,
 
and our AVID site team offers parent/family nights.
 
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pr
iority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
As required by state law, each school maintains a detailed safety plan which is updated each year
. All personnel is trained in emergency procedures and 
students take part in regularly scheduled emergency drills. We have created sweep teams comprised of trained staff members wh
o know what to do in 
the event of an emergency. Food, water, medical and oth
er emergency supplies are updated annually to ensure each campus is ready to respond in the 
event of an emergency or disaster.
 
 
Our campus is diligently guarded by administrators, our counselor, our teachers, campus supervisors, and other school 
personnel. Our school is secured 
with security fencing. Check
-
in and check
-
out procedures are also strictly enforced in our front office. Our school and district maintain constructive 
relationships with local law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety o
f all campuses. Furthermore, through Measure W funding (a general obligation 
bond passed by area voters to upgrade school facilities) our school has upgraded communication systems and radio communicatio
n at all times.

Teachers take time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  We h
ave partnered with AVID 
and AVID Excel, UCLA for 
NGSS science, WUHSD (Whittier Union High School District), Amplify ELA/ELD and Amplify Science, and DBQ (Document Based 
Question)  to support our staff with CCSS professional development.  We also use our site based district coach and GMS teache
rs to provi
de professional 
development to our staff in the areas of PBIS/MTSS, ELD, and professional collaboration/PDAR.  About 90% of our core area tea
chers have been AVID 
trained.  We have also been involved with training from UC Irvine's Irvine Math Project.

Types of Services Funded
 
We use our funds to support our AVID and AVID Excel program.  These programs help students become prepared for high school an
d college.   AVID Excel 
is 
intended for Long
-
Term English Learners (LTEL) so they can become re
-
designated and do well in middle school, high school, college, and career.  We 
also use our funds to support our Intervention Program.  We offer tutoring/intervention for our students as 
well as "remediation" when they do fail.  This 
has helped with our 8th Grade Promotion Policy and it has helped to improve our school culture of not letting in any student 
fail without a significant 
amount of intervention and support.  This has caused us t
o change our practices so we can focus on every student who needs additional support. We 
also offer all scholars the opportunity to visit a college campus.
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e
.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learner
s).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the C
alifornia State Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depe
nding on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
