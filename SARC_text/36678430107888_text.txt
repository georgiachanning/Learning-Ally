By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Highland Grove Elementary opened in August 
2005.  Although the facility is currently more than a decade old, it remains 
an exemplary model of design and outstanding maintenance. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office, at the District Office, or at 
www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. A monthly maintenance report is completed by the Lead Custodian and
 
submitted to the district's 
maintenance and operations department to ensure that any district maintenance and/or safety concerns are addressed 
promptly and appropriately.   The principal also works closely to review data from quarterly walk
-
throughs and a
ddress 
any needs/issues that present through the data.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pr

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many 
opportunities at Highland Grove for parents to become involved with school activities. The most important 
parent involvement that every parent can make is to ensure a family commitment to support reading practice at home. 
Highland Grove utilizes AR Home Co
nnect so parents can be informed when their child completes an Accelerated Reader 
quiz, indicating students' level of success in reading and understanding what they read (reading comprehension). 
Individual teachers use AERIES Parent Portal to share grade i

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Highland Grove Elementary School 
Safety Plan is updated annually. A school Safety Committee has been established 
to encourage participation and input from certificated and classified staff as well as parent and community members. The 
School Safety Plan includes disaster response teams, cl
assroom evacuation routes, and a log of monthly fire, disaster, and 
lock down drills.  Procedures for fire, earthquakes, and lock down situations are all addressed.  Each classroom is equipped 
with disaster preparedness kits provided by the Highland Grove 
Elementary PTA.  Food and water for the entire school 
community has been procured and is stored in the land
-
sea container on campus, should the need arise for students and 
staff to remain at school for lengthy times due to an emergency. Teachers submit to 
the principal annually a copy of their 
assertive, progressive discipline plan. A variety of other means of correction measures are implemented prior to a student 
being suspended.  The exception to this is when a child's actions are in violation of Educatio
n Code and/or demonstrate 
that another individual has been physically harmed by the students' actions.

Highland Grove utilizes multiple opportunities throughout the school year to support professional development.  
First, 
Highland Grove staff participates in two full day professional development days as a staff, one at the beginning of the 
school year to analyze CAASPP data as a team and select a focus for the upcoming school year and a second day selected 
as the dis
trict wide professional development day.  During our first PD day as a staff, grade level teams work diligently to 
articulate their students' needs and develop a plan from day one.  The second full day of PD occurs a few months into the 
school year in whic
h the entire staff participates in a full
-
day of professional learning and growth.  In addition to the two 
full
-
day professional development days, Highland Grove staff also participates in six early release (minimum days) in which 
the staff works on data a
nalysis, lesson development in the areas of reading, writing or Math with our Math Intervention 
teacher.  Our staff also participates in three after school meetings per month that are dedicated to professional learning 
and growth.  Teachers explore a varie
ty of topics such as rigorous instruction, proactive behavior supports, use of writing 
rubrics, as well as technology topics such as planning for ProWise lessons and implementation of Google classroom as well 
as use of programs such as Flipgrid and WeVideo
.  Finally, our teachers are also afforded the opportunity to sign
-
up and 
attend various professional development offerings throughout the year that are supported by our district professional 
development department.  Teachers from Highland Grove regularly 
attend the District's ProWise Professional Learning 
Network (PLN) as well as additional offerings on classroom management, writing, and technology integration.
 
 
The professional development focus for the 2019
-
2020 school is supporting students needs in the
 
area of math with an 
intense focus of development strong number sense and math fluency with all of our students.  Our two full day 
professional development days in both August and November were dedicated to professional development in this area 
supported 
by mathematics guru, Kim Sutton from Creative Mathematics.  Kim Sutton will also be returning in March for 
two additional days in which teachers will be subbed from their classrooms to participate in 2 hour blocks of grade level 
specific planning in the ar
ea of math.  Teachers are also participating in six early release (partial days) on topics focused 
on lesson development in the areas of reading, writing, socials studies (utilizing our new social studies adoption) math and 
technology.  Throughout the 2019
-
2020 school year, teachers are also participating in three meetings per month focused 
on data analysis and response to that data in the form of reteach lesson development.
