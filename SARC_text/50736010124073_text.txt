School Description
 
Hurd Barrington was built in 2011 and is one of four Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade 
elementary schools in the Newman
-
Crows Landing Unified 
School District. Our enrollment is 
approximately at 461. Our demographics includes nineteen General Education classes, one 
Resource class and one Special Day class. The demographics of our student body consists of 61% 
Free/Reduced School Lunch, 63.4% Socio
economic Disadvantaged, 33.5   % English Language 
Learners, and 13% Students with Disabilities.
 
 
We have a multipurpose room with a stage that is used as our main cafeteria and is shared by 
Afterschool program for academic supports and enrichment activitie
s.  We have a STEAM lab that 
is opened to all teachers, students and ASP to teach robotics and STEAM standards. Teachers have 
a designated block of library time that is dedicated to encourage reading. Students get to check out 
books as well as get to liste
n to popular books read to them by our librarian. Our library is also open 
to students before school, recess, lunch and after
-
school so that students are given the opportunity 
to read and take Accelerated Reading (AR) tests and simply socialize with peers 
to build confidence.  
Along with classroom P.E. time, students at Barrington get one day of P.E. time by our district P.E. 
team that focuses on physical fitness standards and nutrition.  In addition, we have a conference 
room in the main office that is des
ignated to hold our Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) 
meetings, Individual Educational Plan (IEP's), Student Study Team (SST), and training.
 
 
This year we are fortunate enough to have a counselor that is designated to Barrington only.  The 
counselo
r supports students individually, whole class and by referral basis. Topics and support 
range from academics, anger management, anxiety, emotional, self
-
esteem, health concerns, and 
social skills to simply having someone to talk with.  The counselor hangs 
out before school, during 
recess, lunch time and after school building relationships and supporting students with socialization 
tools. Collaboratively we strive on implementing a Positive Behavior Intervention Program with a 
Tiered level support system to 
support all students.
 
 
We have a great partnership with our After
-
school program.  They offer a safe environment for 
students to continue their learning while enriching them with music, art, athletics, computer 
literacy, homework support and 
academics. We believes in nurturing and developing well
-
rounded 
learners.
 
 
Barrington focuses on rigorous and relevant instructional practices and programs that fully 
implement State Standards and educates our students towards the path of College and Caree
r 
readiness. The standards are a road map to what all students are expected to know at each grade 
level and be able to do.  It also helps guide our teachers in developing meaningful and purposeful 
lessons.  Response to Instruction and Intervention and GATE
 
programs are provided to offer 
support and challenge all our students.
 
 
Part of developing rigorous and relevant instruction is building relationships with all school 
members especially our students.  Our site has embraced that by creating a team that con
sists of 
instructional aides, yard duty, cafeteria staff, custodians, teachers and administrators we can 
support our students in many capacities.  Everyone at Barrington have assumed the responsibility 
of reviewing student data, implementing academic stand
ards, making instructional shifts while 
meeting the differentiated needs of ALL our learners.

We continue to work collaboratively to implement the standards by creating and implementing skill
-
specific lessons, and using cutting
-
edge materials and assessmen
ts to monitor student progress. Barrington focuses on ensuring a professional learning environment where 
our students can thrive and want to continue to be life
-
long learners.
 
 
Mission:
 
Hurd Barrington Elementary School has high expectations for all stude
nts through rigorous instruction, that allows for individual 
differences and learning styles. Our school promotes a safe, caring, and supportive environment. We seek to build positive re
lationships 
with students, parents, and staff. We strive to have our p
arents, teachers, and community members actively involved in our students' 
learning.
 
 
Our ultimate goal is always safety first, building literacy and numeracy across all content areas, enhancing technology knowl
edge, ensuring 
a safe and welcoming facility 
will build relationships with parents, students, teachers, administration and community.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Professional developed is provided to staff throughout the year in the form of 
PLC's once a week, Collaboration days, and staff meetings plus release 
time to attend content training or county office standards training as wells as social emotional trainings, based on student 
and staff needs.  Data and 
instructional practices are evalu
ated through classroom visits and data are reviewed and PD's are planned and facilitated to address the needs of the 
school or individual students or grades.  Our district also provides after school training for effective teaching and technol
ogy.   Each gr

two planning days where they can collaborate and backwards map the state standards and plan for the upcoming lessons/standard
s, review data and 
make instructional adjustments.
 
 
All PD's and meetings help support our focus on rigorous an
d relevant instructional programs that fully implements state standards and educates our 
students towards the path of College and Career readiness. The standards are a road map to what all students are expected to 
know at each grade level 
and be able to do
.  It also helps guides our teachers in developing meaningful lessons.  Response to Instruction and Intervention and GATE pro
grams are 
provided to offer support and challenge all our students.
 
 
Part of developing rigorous and relevant instruction is buildi
ng relationships with all school members especially our students.  Our site has embraced that 
by creating a team that consists of instructional aides, yard duty, ASP staff, cafeteria staff, custodians, counselors, teach
ers and administrators we can 
accompl
ish a lot.  They all have assumed responsibility of implementing academic standards while meeting the differentiated needs of
 
all our learners. 
We continue to work collaboratively to implement the standards by creating and implementing skill
-
specific lesso
ns, and using cutting
-
edge materials 
and assessments to monitor student progress.
