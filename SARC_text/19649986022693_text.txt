About the SARC
 
By Februa
ry 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundin
g Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state an
d local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
As part of our School Site Plan, one of our goals is to increase parent and student engagement.  We know the success of each 
student is directly related 
to the partnership we share with our Rosedell parents and commun
ity.  One way to optimize their educational success is to communicate effectively 

etters from teachers 
and administration; and mess

media accounts are other form of communication used to keep the community informed.  The Parent/Student Handbook provides par
ents, g
uardians 

 
 
Another way to increase parent engagement is through our Partners in Learning nights.  At these events parents learn and prac
tice skills side by side with 
their c
hild.  This form of parent nights allows for quality parent/child time while gaining an understanding of the expectations of 

Parent conferences, School Site Council, English Language Acquisition Committee, and Student Success Te
am meetings are also a part of our efforts to 
increase parent engagement.
 
 

to create and promote a 
strong relationship between home
 
and school.  As our top priority, we want our school community to be safe, productive and rewarding for all.  We 
encourage active parent involvement by joining our PTA, attending school events and activities, assisting in the decision
-
making process, and 
volunteering
