By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES & SAFETY
 
Cottonwood Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus 
supervision. Original facilities were built in 1987; ongoing maintenance and modernization ensure the campus 
provides adequate space for students and staff. The campus is comprised of the following:
 
 
Acreage = 10
 
Square Footage = 57,793
 
Number of Permanent
 
Classrooms = 18
 
Number of Portable Classrooms = 25
 
Number of Restrooms (student use) = 2 sets
 
Library = 1
 
Music Room = 1
 
Quad Area = 1
 
Staff Work Room/Lounge = 2
 
 
CAMPUS SUPERVISION
 
Seven proctors are strategically placed in various areas of the campus an
d at crosswalks to supervise students as they 
enter school grounds. During recess, teachers are on the playground to monitor behavior and playground activities. 
Proctors (seven) provide supervision during the lunch recess and monitor both cafeteria and pla
yground activities. At the 
end of the day, teachers escort students to after
-
school on
-
campus programs, the bus area, and student pickup areas to 
ensure students leave campus in a safe and orderly manner. A checklist system is used to ensure students have 
either left 
the campus or are in their designated after
-
school program.
 
 
CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The custodial staff and district's maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and 
functioning for students, staff, and visitors. The principal and daytime 
custodian meet daily to discuss maintenance issues and special projects; hand
-
held walkie talkies enhance two
-
way 
communication efforts and help facilitate an immediate response to em
ergency situations.
 
 
One full
-
time custodian and two full
-
time evening custodians are assigned to Cottonwood Elementary and work closely 
with the principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events. Every morning before 
school begins; 
the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attention prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. Restrooms are checked at least three times a day for cleanliness and then cleaned as needed
. 
The evening custodians clean classrooms, desks, restrooms, and are responsible for set up and take down of equipment 
and/or furniture for afternoon and evening events.
 
 
Cottonwood Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance & Operations depa
rtment (M&O) for larger 
projects, routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables 
Cottonwood Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Emerge
ncy 
situations are regularly resolved in one hour or less.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major
 
repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.

State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks and are research
-
based.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and 
concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the district 
and school site. During the 2011
-
12 school year, the district did not provide a staff development buy
-
back day. Each school 
site identifies and coordinates its own staff developme
nt activities based upon individual student needs, school site plans, 
and the districts designated focus areas. Supplemental training involving curriculum, teaching strategies, and 
methodologies in the content areas of reading/language arts and math were p
rovided at site request via Coordinator of 
Staff Development and Academic Coaches.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the principal, assistant principal, and Staff Council. Training programs and 
topics were chosen based upon the school's theme,
 
school's instructional focus and student needs. Results for the 
California Standardized Tests and district summative assessments, teacher feedback, and findings from classroom 
observations help identify areas for improvement and training programs that wil
l enable teachers to deliver a challenging 
and rigorous standards
-
based education fostering student success and proficiency.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on 
the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supplemental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff development topics and 
focus areas are identified and 
selected based upon input from the district's Professional Development Committee, 
Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. The Professional Development Committee meets four times a year to 
review student test results from state and district asse
ssments and review teacher survey needs. The Principals' 
Roundtable provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and share training needs based upon data analysis and 
classroom observations from each school site.
 
 
New teachers receive intensive 
support and training through the district's Induction Program and New Teachers Academy. 
For beginning and out
-
of
-
state teachers, the district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Beginning 
Teacher Support and Assessment), a statewide and
 
state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing support and skill 
building through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to support year
-
round hiring
 
practices; the orientation is a 
comprehensive overview of the district's policies, school law, English language learners support, curriculum, instruction, 
and grade
-
level and content area specialties.
