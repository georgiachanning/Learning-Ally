About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information ab
out the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend
 
to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements,
 
see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The goal for 2019
-
20 school year will be to increase participation in our parent teacher groups for PTA, SSC, and ELAC. We will be reaching out
 
to families 
to boost parent volunteerism. Campaign drives for recruitment
 
to PTA have been increased. We will coordinate with our district Ed. Services Department 
to offer information to our parents on literacy support at home via Foot Steps to Brilliance in the primary grades. In additi
on, all of our parents will have 
the bene
fit of having information given to them by Ed. Services Department for ELD support. This year we are looking to track the lev
el of parent 
participation and volunteerism on our campus. We will begin by creating a parent volunteer form that we will ask each 
parent to complete as they 
volunteer for a school related activity or assist in the classrooms. In addition, every parent or community member who wishes
 
to volunteer at school will
