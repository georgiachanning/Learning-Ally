By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are an 
integral and valued part of the Bret Harte school community.  There are many ways for parents to engage 
with teachers and in the school day with the education of their child.  Back to School Night early in the school year is an 
opportunity for parents to l
earn from the classroom teacher about classroom schedules, curricular plans, grade level 
expectations, academic and behavior expectations, and methods for communicating with teachers.  At that event, parents 
are also encouraged to join an email list and re
ceive information and updates on classroom activities, events, and projects 
from both the teacher and a Room Parent.  Parents meet with the teacher at the end of the first trimester to discuss 
grades, academic progress, and citizenship marks in physical ed
ucation, personal effort and other areas.  While all parents 
are invited to meet with the teacher first trimester, only parents of students with below grade level performance are 
invited to meet 2nd trimester.  Teachers, though, are happy to meet with any 
parent regarding academic progress at any 
time during the school year.   At the end of the school year, parents are invited to Open House, to see classroom displays 
of student projects, assignments, art, and is a showcase of work completed in not only thei
r child's classroom but all 
classrooms in the school.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to join PTA by paying the nominal fee and to be an active participant in Bret Harte's PTA, which 
meets monthly.  The PTA coordinates a wide variety of opportunities for parental 
involvement in addition to the monthly 
meetings, which periodically feature guest speakers on topics of interest to parents of elementary age students, and may 
feature District staff to provide information on programs and departments.  The PTA plans fun an
d educational activities 
for the students throughout each school year, including a Book Fair, and the Bee
-
tique, which allows students to learn 
lessons of money and spending while being able to buy holiday presents for their families and friends.  The PTA 
conducts 
fundraisers which fund bus transportation for field trips for each grade level, ensuring that every student has access to 
meaningful learning opportunities off campus.  Additionally, their fundraising supports arts, science and technology 
instruct
ion at Bret Harte.  PTA funds cover the salary of a music consultant to teach music to our Junior Kindergarten, 
Transitional Kindergarten, Kindergarten and first grade students on a weekly basis.  The PTA has also funded three 
rotations of STEaM classes fo
r every grade level and include hands
-
on instruction and experiences in gardening, recycling, 
composting, photography, art, and dance instruction.  PTA meetings are one way parents connect, and the PTA fundraisers 
and events are an opportunity for parents 
to volunteer, meet and connect with other parents, and model school 
involvement.  Our Fundraising Committee, also a parent
-
based organization, is the primary fundraiser for the fifth graders 
Outdoor Science School trip. Because of their efforts, every 5th 
grade student is able to attend the five
-
day, four night OSS 
trip regardless of ability to pay.
 
 
Parents also are important members of School Site Council, which is responsible for the development of both the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement and for the
 
Safe School Plan.  The Principal, teachers, a classified staff member, and parents 
work together on School Site Council to review achievement data, create strategies, and allot funds to support target 
groups' academic achievement in the 
School Plan
 
for St
udent Achievement. For the Safe School Plan, School Site Council 
members are responsible for assessing different aspects of school safety.  The SSC then creates goals for the coming year 
which address areas of need in school safety.
 
 
This year, parents hav
e come together to create a Sustainability Committee.  This parent driven committee's goal is to 
encourage children and families to adopt habits and actions that reduce their impact on the earth by reducing food waste, 
using sustainable products, and being
 
mindful of our daily practices.  Parent outreach and student/school
-
based activities 
will be conducted Earth Week and establish a culture of recycling and conservation that will define the culture of the 
school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bret Harte's School Safety Plan was written with the cooperation and input from the School Site Council.  
Working with 
the Principal, the SSC identified the following goals:  Provide regular training for all staff, including all classified staf
f and 
Yard Supervisors, in current practices for responding to emergencies (natural disaster, intruder on campus, etc.
), and 
posting Shelter in Place instructions prominently in every classroom.
 
 
Please see the new Safety Plan as developed and revised annually.
 
 
The plan was reviewed by the District's School Climate and Safety Committee, which provided feedback and sugges
tions 
about the plan.
