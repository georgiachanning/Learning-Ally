About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https:/
/www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that 
the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our 
textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
We have multiple portables that are in good condition to go along with our three original buildings.  We have a day custodian
 
along with two night 
custodians who keep our facilities clean and free of t
rash.  All classrooms and restrooms are cleaned every day.  District maintenance staff helps with 
minor repairs, removes graffiti, and maintains landscaping on a regular schedule.
 
 
During the summer of 2010, the drop off area on Bryant Street was revamped 
with a wider sidewalk area, new walkways with railings that are American 
Disabilities Act compliant and new chain link fencing were installed.  Projects finished during the 2010

2011 school year included installing a marquee, 
and replacing the awning over 
the picnic area.  During the 2011
-
2012 school year, four trees and turf grass were installed to upgrade the Bryant Street 
sidewalk area.  Another section of artificial turf was installed to extend the existing turf project along Bryant Street in f
ront of t
he school during the 2012 
-
 
2013 school year, and during the 2013
-
2014 school year, one classroom floor was updated with a new vinyl surface and again in 2015
-
2016 and 2019
-
2020. Since the 2011
-
2012 school year, sections of the the MPR has been covered ove
r with student tile work every year and completed during the 2017
-
2018 school year. During 2016
-
2017, a new primary playground structure was installed as well as seeding and upgrading the watering system in the 
primary grass field. Before the start of the 
2018
-
2019 school year, all tables in the lunch room were replaced due to safety concerns.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspec

ou see on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since
 
that time, those conditions may have changed.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p
riority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many 
opportunities for parent involvement at MSJE.  Parents are active members of our Parent Teacher Club (PTC), School Site Counc
il(SSC), 
and the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC).  Parent volunteers run our Fine Arts Mini Experience (FAME) program as
 
well as volunteer countless 
hours in the classroom. Parents are in the cafeteria at lunch time to supervise students. A different set of parents monitor 
our composting and recycling 
program at lunchtime to make sure lunch items are placed into the correct
 
bin as our students compost, recycle and donate food items to a near by 
homeless shelter. Parents organize the Halloween Carnival, Winterfest singing program, Holiday Kids Store,  and give up their
 
time to assist with our pick 
up and drop off valet system
.  The valet system is coordinated by parent volunteers Mr. Javinder Manjot and Mrs. Alice Wu.  MSJE's success is in large 
part due to our parent support and involvement.  Our PTC is headed by Alice Wu,  who is always encouraging parents to get inv
olved an
d help out any 
way they can to continue MSJE's on going positive place to work, learn and participate with students and staff.  Due to our a
cademic excellence and 
parent involvement, MSJE is one of the top ranked schools in the state.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

School Safety Plan
 
The principal along with the teachin
g staff, monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses.  Parents serve 
as noon supervisors to monitor the children and ensure their safety during lunch and lunch recess.  Teachers regularly review
 
the rules wi
th their students 
for safe and responsible behavior in and outside the classroom.  During the first week of school, the principal holds discipl
ine assemblies for each grade 
level to review all school rules and establish expectations.  Visitors coming to MS

stay.  Adults seen on campus without a visitor pass are directed to return to the office, sign in and receive a visitor's bad
ge.  As part of our ongoing safety 
patrol/ valet system
, students open the door, help in lifting backpacks and then shut the door with the correct greeting 'good morning' or 'good 
afternoon'.  This action is completed within ten seconds and monitored by our parent volunteers.
 
 
The Safety Plan was last reviewed
 
and updated in March, 2019 with staff input.  The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories 
of emergency supplies.  We keep a copy of the plan in the office.  The plan was shared  with staff on August 26, 2019 as part
 
of our s
taff development 
day.  The school practices fire drills every month, earthquake drills four times a year, shelter in place and lock down drill
s.  The major areas of focus in 
the MSJE safety plan are to identify those staff members who are part of the chain
 
of command and the areas of responsibility for each position.  The 
plan also highlights our goals to insure a safe,clean, working, and learning environment for the entire MSJE community.
 
 
During the 2009

2010 school year we inventoried our disaster supply
 
stored shed, replaced expired food, added thirteen 55
-
gallon water barrels, a mylar 
blanket for every person on campus, new tools and medical equipment, and many other needed supplies were added.  During the 2
016
-
2017 school 
year, individual drinking wate
r containers were added to our drinking supply. As a community project, in 2018, all shelves were reinforced to prevent 
movement during an earthquake. In May, 2019, we had a school wide disaster drill involving staff reporting to their emergency
 
response t
eam location 
and having each member perform tasks associated with their position.  Feedback was gathered to improve job descriptions of ea
ch position.
