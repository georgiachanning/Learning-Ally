About the S
ARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local C
ontrol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to add
ress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planne
d Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2004, we completed a seven million dollar modernization of our school facilities, the first since Montair School was built
 
in 1958. The construction was 
funded by local and state bonds. School improvements included full
 
ADA and safety compliance, new roofs, HVAC, lighting, plumbing, carpeting, and 
casework, and installation of a new data system (including VOIP phones and T1 internet connections in all rooms) and alarms. 
A joint planning process 
with site, district, and c
ommunity members, enabled us to make some adjustments to the existing structure to create regulation classrooms, common 
rooms, and small learning spaces for intervention programs. Our staff and community take great pride in our facility. Student
 
work is di
splayed in 
classrooms, in common areas, and the school office. Our dedicated custodians and caring student body, keep Montair clean and 
aesthetically pleasing. 
In November of 2010, the entire school took part in a bulb planting day where over 500 bulbs wer
e planted around the campus as a beautification project.
 
 
The district provides regular landscaping and maintenance service. Three distinct playgrounds (pre
-
K/K, 1
-
2 and 3
-
5) and the adjacent park provide safe 
and stimulating play spaces. Our Montair Found
ation funded a brand new, ADA compliant 1
-
2 playground in Fall of 2018.  Garden boxes throughout 
campus provide students with hands
-
on science learning and beautify our campus.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr

may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and

The Montair community provides outstanding support for our school. Parents are an integral part of the school program, active
 
in dozens of school 
programs coordinated by our Parent

Teacher Association. Parents also serve on our School Site
 
Council, Gifted and Talented Education Committee, our 
Montair Foundation, and in our Montair Dad's Club. Parents make daily connections at Montair by volunteering in our classroom
s, the school library, on 
field trips, and running the Art Docent program. P
arents also support the school through their active participation in family events including; our school 
carnival, our Festival Around the World, our Winter and Spring Concerts, the Book Fair, the Reflections Program, and the annu
al  auction.
 
 
The Montair 
Foundation, a non

enrichment and intervention programs including classroom paraprofessional aides, library, computer technology, a readin
g and math intervention 
program, drama, vocal music and a character development program. Community organizations including Girl and Boy Scout troops 
and soccer and 
baseball teams meet at Montair. Events such as our school carnival, movie night, Camp Montai
r, and skate nights serve the entire school community. 
The school has involved local businesses and corporations through teacher grants and classroom donations. Local high school s

School Safety Plan
 
The Montair School Safety Plan addresses the physical, social, and emotional safety of those in our school community. Through
 
the development of clear, 
concise emergency 
procedures, along with ongoing training, our staff and students prepare for a range of emergency situations.
 
 
We conduct monthly emergency drills to practice evacuation procedures for fire, shelter in place, stranger on campus, and/or 
earthquake disaster 
p
reparedness. In 2018, our PTA funded new emergency backpacks for every classroom as well as outfitting our emergency containe
r with new supplies.
 
 
All students participate in the Sanford Harmony Social Emotional Curriculum in their classrooms weekly. Addit
ional support services are provided through 
our Rainbow and Discovery Center programs, help to meet the social and emotional needs of our students. Our School Safety Pla
n is updated annually 
and reviewed by both staff members and our School Site Council. T
he School Safety Plan was last updated and approved in the Spring of 2019.

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, 
inclusive model of professional development for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and in
structional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wid
e K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valle
y Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of inst
ructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in
 
addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learnin
g, and lesson design.

We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align 
with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the
 
opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learner
s in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.
 
 
Additionally, our Foundation and our PTA support teachers attending seminars and workshops for Literacy instruction, math ins
truction, technology, 
mindset, dyslexia support and
 
more. All teachers at MT are invited to participate in a variety of educational experiences offered locally and around the 
country to further their instructional practice. After attending an workshop or inservice, participating teachers lead staff 
profess
ional development to 
share their take aways.
