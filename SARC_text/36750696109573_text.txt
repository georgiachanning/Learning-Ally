About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Pepper Tree has an outstanding PTA. Parents organize many well
-
attended events throughout the year to raise money for programs, playground 
equipment, field trips and other school needs. Parents at Pepper Tree are extremely gen
erous with their time, talents, and money, which enable us to 
provide an even more quality program than we would otherwise not be able to offer. Parents and grandparents help in the class
rooms on a regular basis 
and assist daily in the library (shelving an
d repairing books) and workroom (running materials for classroom use). At the first grade level, parents organize 
and run the home reading program. They check out books to students, make sure they have been read when returned and assign ne
w books. In a num
ber 
of grades, parents oversee students working on intervention programs to improve reading and math skills. Parents and communit
y members help 
celebrate Read Across America to promote reading and provide a connection to careers in the community.  Parent v
olunteers also plan and oversee our 
annual Science Fair contest. Parents unable to help during the school day, help out by making monetary contributions that are
, in turn, matched by their 
employers. Other employers make contributions to the school based o
n the number of hours their employees volunteer. We are still able to experience 
field trips because of parent participation and funding. The arts are kept alive by each year celebrating students who enter 
the national Reflections 
contest and PTA provided 
art assemblies throughout the year. In addition, a Saturday Art Day, where students come to be instructed in various art 
mediums by volunteers, is also offered each year. Pepper Tree also hosts the Watch D.O.G.S. program. Watch D.O.G.S are "Dads 
of Great S
tudents" or 
can be a any positive male role model.  Watch D.O.G.S help in the parking lot, crosswalk, on the playground, and all over cam
pus. Pepper Tree loves our 
volunteers and sincerely appreciate all they they do for our students.

students to prepare for any emergency situation. This plan is reviewed monthly and adjustments are shared and implemented wit
h all staff as they occur. 
The Comprehensive Plan addresses various emergency situations and outlines procedures and polici
es related to all situations. It outlines staff emergency 
and safety team responsibilities. We practice safety drills regularly and work proactively to prevent unsafe situations. Our 
Comprehensive Safety Plan is 
reviewed, updated and discussed with the fac
ulty throughout the year. The last annual review for the School Safety Plan was conducted in September of 
2019.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified 
through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding s
pecific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences
 
that allow them to 
grow professionally and
 
provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading interventi
on 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time f
or teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching St
rategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning
, 21st Century 
Classroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Gen
eration Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day workshops, after
-
school workshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and
 
off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the
 
Dist
rict calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
