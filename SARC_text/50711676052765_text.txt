By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mark Twain Junior High School opened its doors in 1951.  Our enrollment is 817 students in the seventh and eighth grade.  
The instructional program is a blend of 
academic classes, elective classes and physical education.  Students are scheduled 
into single subject academic classes in Mathematics, Science, Language Arts, and Social Science. In addition, students may 
be scheduled into Academic Language Development, R
EAD 180 or Beyond the Basic Facts for extra support. The Academic 
Language Development class is strategically focused on developing academic language through intensive writing 
instruction.  READ 180 is a comprehensive reading intervention program designed 
to address individual student needs.  
The academic curriculum is supported by the electives:  Art, Exploring Technology, Orchestra, Band, Journalism, Star 
Center, Spanish, and Choir.
 
 
The incentive programs for academic achievement are:  Pride Inside progr
am, which provides incentives and awards for 
outstanding effort and achievement in academics and citizenship.  Also, Block MT is an academic
-
based program that 
acknowledges students who have met and exceeded academic goals in their core classes.  Students 
are recognized for 
earning and maintaining a GPA of 4.0. To prepare our students on their transition to junior high school, we start out in the 
spring visiting elementary schools to talk with their administration and all 6th grade students.  We also met wi
th all 6th 
grade elementary schools teachers who feed into Mark Twain.  The English and Mathematics departments met with those 
teachers in the Spring to align priority standards and where those 6th graders should be upon entering junior high. We 
then began
 
the year with an orientation for incoming 7th graders and their families.  It is a priority for our  academic 
counselor to meet with each student a minimum of once a quarter. These meetings consist of schedule review, diagnosing 
issues, and addressing con
cerns at school, and a general awareness of resources available to all students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
The following procedures are in place at Mark Twain Junior High School to provide a safe campus for students,
 
staff and 
visitors. Monthly briefings by the administration with campus supervisors are conducted to share information about 
school security. During the school day, campus supervisors, the staff, and administrators monitor the campus to ensure 
campus safe
ty. A campus supervisor is assigned bike patrol to monitor the campus. All visitors to the Mark Twain campus 
are required to check
-

students during passing perio
ds to ensure an orderly transition from class to class. A yard duty is employed as extra support 
during the day. Administration, campus supervisors, yard duty, support staff and teachers supervise designated areas at 
the beginning of school and dismissal w
hile students are leaving the campus. Cabinet meetings are held by the 
administration to assess the overall safety of the Mark Twain campus. The Safety Committee, which consists of teachers, 
other school staff, students and parents, meets periodically with
 
the administration to discuss school safety concerns and 
to make recommendations for improvement. Modifications are made when necessary.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
pr
ovided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
This school has classrooms, laboratories, cafeteria, gymnasium, library, locker room and an administration office. The main 
campus was built in 1951 and opened in 195
1.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service. Emergency repairs are 
given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The Operations Department has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
are available at the school of
fice, or at the Maintenance & Operations office. The Operations Department works 
continuously with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance:
 
The District participated in the State School Def
erred Maintenance Program, which provided flexible state matching funds 
to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school facilities components. State 
contributions to this Program ended in the 2012
-
13 school y
ear. Deferred Maintenance typically includes paving, roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems. Carry
-
over funds for 
deferred maintenance projects throughout the District in Funds 01 a
nd 14 have been exhausted. The Board has authorized 
the General Fund to annually contribute $2 million to Facility Maintenance to be used for new construction and 
maintenance projects throughout the District, $2 million to Deferred Maintenance for maintena
nce projects throughout 

against all other District site repairs and the most urgent repairs are addressed first.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achi
evement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alte
rnate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievem
ent standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to
 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

s calculated by taking the total 
number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smar
ter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the 
table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for sta
tistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the
 
test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to 
ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  
to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and
 
PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
sc
hools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, di
strict and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and m
anagers alike.
