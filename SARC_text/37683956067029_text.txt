By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
The 
South Bay Union School District sets a high priority on providing sufficient textbooks to support each school's 
instructional program. Adoptions are conducted on a six to eight year cycle by subject, in an effort to ensure textbooks 
are always current. All
 
adopted textbooks and instructional material programs meet state standards and have been 
adopted by the State Board of Education and South Bay Union governing board.
 
 
The availability of sufficient state
-
adopted and standards
-
aligned textbooks for each pu
pil, including English learners, for 
use in class and to take home are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum frameworks adopted by the 
California State Board of Education in all core curriculum areas.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff take great care in ensuring that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns 
are mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning schedules are developed by the 
Principal and t
he Facilities Director to guarantee daily cleaning of campus. Restroom facilities are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Custodian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs are addressed 
in a timely manner. Copies 
of inspections are available at the school and facilities offices.
 
 
Staff regularly engage in emergency preparedness drills.  The emergency procedures are reviewed on a regular basis 
beginning with a discussion during the initial staff meeting on July 16, 
2019. The Head Custodian also performs a safety 
inspection on a monthly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities office. Regular and preventative 
maintenance is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work order system for effic
iency and better record 
keeping.
 
 
Security is bolstered by the presence of a security resident who lives on the property and inspects the property during 
nights and weekends to prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, surveillance cameras are located thro
ughout the 
campus.
 
 
As per Education Code, the district is required to include in this document, a description of any needed maintenance to 
ensure good repair as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is maintained in a manner that assures 
that it 
is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to a Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of 
California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the conditions at a school site with ratings of
 
"goo
d," "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overall summary of the conditions at each school on a scale of 
"exemplary," "good," "fair," or "poor." The instrument shall not require capital enhancements beyond the standards to 
which the facility was desi
gned and constructed.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
At the time of the above inspection on August 13, 2019, the average ranking for Berry Elementary was 99.58%, giving the 
school a rating of "Exemplary," The rating is determined by
 
the average of the 15 categories addressed. Below are the 
percentages, descriptions, and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified in the August FIT report have been completed and
/or 
resolved.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

South Bay Union School District has developed a
 
Crisis Response Box for each of its school sites. Each box contains a 
comprehensive Emergency Procedural Guidelines binder specific to each site. The binder includes state required disaster 
procedures such as, but not limited to, bomb threat, earthquake, 
fire, medical emergency, missing student, and shootings. 
Evacuation maps, evacuation sites, key phone numbers, district/site communication plan, are just a few of the elements 
included within the plan. School staff reviewed plan on September 4, 2019. Schoo
l sites conduct various types of drills on 
a regular basis throughout the year and record the exercise on the Emergency Drills Record form, which is submitted to 
the district office each December.

The primary focus of the professional development is in the
 
areas of reading, writing, math and technology. Currently we 
are implementing the Teacher College Reading and Writing project Units of Study in reading and writing with the goal of  
creating proficient readers. In addition, Berry Elementary continues to b
e an affiliate school for the Teachers College 
Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) through Columbia University. Along with on
-
going support our teachers will receive 
a week of professional development from the staff developer of TCRWP. The South Bay Union 
School District academic 
calendar includes 35 minimum days (early release Wednesdays) that are dedicated to grade level professional learning 
communities or staff meetings.  In addition, teachers at all school sites receive a weekly prep hour to develop an
d design 
rigorous and relevant lesson plans.  Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) are at the heart of all staff development, 
ensuring a deeper implementation of effective instructional strategies, driven by student achievement data. During the 
implem
entation of the professional development teachers are supported through in
-
class coaching, instructional rounds, 
teacher progress monitoring and by analyzing student data.
