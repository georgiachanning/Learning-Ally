Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort
, the district uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
Aptitud Community Academy at Goss was buil
t in 1961. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field Act 
requirements of the State Building Code with a focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead containing 
building materials are found, they are removed according t
o Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, and Local 
requirements. Deferred maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate district buildings. Needed 
repairs and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
Whenever possi
ble, school facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 

 
the instructional program.
 
The Alum Rock School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, 
ensure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that 
classrooms, lavatories, serving kitc
hens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and staff use.
 
Regular oversight by district maintenance crews ensures that grass and landscaped areas are well maintained, and that 

safe for use.
 
Aptitud received a Kaboom! grant and built a new play structure for our first through eighth graders to play on as well as 
a school garden. City Year held a beautification day in which volunteers painted murals of positive role models, colleg
e 
and university logos, and positive messages throughout the campus' walls.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant 
to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education p
opulation and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
ar
e aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy
 
the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

-

Aptitud is a neighborho
od school and values and includes all stakeholders in every facet of the educational process. To 
encourage parent participation, Aptitud maintains a system of open communication and employs a variety of ways to 
increase stakeholder communication. Not only 

but pertinent school information, including results of the school evaluation process, school data, and school programs are 
also available to parents in the and school's web page,
 
and through other means of communication such as our monthly 
calendar which is written in multiple languages. We also utilize parent link which calls, emails, and texts all parents with 
current numbers on file as well as through ClassDojo. Because parent 
and community participation is essential to student 
achievement, Aptitud Community Academy at Goss provides a number of parent and community involvement 
opportunities. This year our parents have been trained in Los Dichos and they have been reading to stud
ents in different 
classrooms.
 
 
Aptitud parents are encouraged to be active participants in the education of their children. ELS Classes as well as Common 
Core, Bullying, and parent leadership classes are provided for parents throughout the school year. Apt
itud has an Advisory 
Board, an active Parent Teacher Association, School Site Council and an English Learner Advisory Committee who advise 
the principal in making decisions around the school plan. Parents are also active participants as volunteers helping 
with 
clerical tasks and in many cases working in the classrooms. Curriculum nights and special sessions for parents of at
-
risk 
students are spread throughout the year.
