School Description
 
 
Our Roosevelt School Mission Statement: A community of caring individuals 
working together to 
achieve academic excellence for all students.
 
 
Enrollment in Roosevelt School signals a significant transition for Taft students who have previously 
attended smaller, neighborhood primary schools since kindergarten. For many 
students, Roosevelt 
School provides their first opportunity to interact with classmates from all areas of greater Taft. 
They are also expected to undertake greater individual responsibility for schoolwork and 
homework. In addition, becoming a Rough Rider a
ffords such opportunities as monthly classroom 
music instruction, academic competitions at the county level, and the opportunity to participate in 
the junior high band.
 
 
Data to celebrate student successes and identify areas of needs within individuals, sp
ecial 
populations, and grade levels are evaluated frequently from a variety of local assessments and 
standardized state test scores. Part of that data analysis is to examine the large student population 
on campus who are second language learners. Efforts t
o improve the academic ability of these 
students, and the skill sets of the teachers who provide the daily instruction, will continue to be a 
focus for the Roosevelt learning community.
 
 
School goals include a relentless purpose to align the school
-
wide cu
rriculum, pacing guides, and 
assessments to ensure instructional consistency throughout the school while focusing on improved 
attendance so that all students receive the best first instruction.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul
d contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The District and site staffs work together to ensure that Roosevelt School is clean, safe, and functional. A facility inspect
ion tool developed by the State 
of California is used to assist in these efforts.
 
The resul
ts of this survey are available at the school and District offices.
 
 
Roosevelt School dates from 1954 and currently houses students in 24 of 24 classrooms. Modernization included the addition of
 
a separate library/media 
center building as well as improving
 
heating and air conditioning systems, providing handicap access, upgrading the classrooms for technology, as well 
as numerous structural, security related, and cosmetic improvements to the existing building.
 
 
Roosevelt School maintains four part me custod
ians who work in conjunction with the principal and district maintenance staff to ensure that repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is in place to ensure effi
cient service and that 
emerge
ncy repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Access to the school site before school is limited to two gates and one cafeteria door. Staff members monitor our cafeteria f
or 25 minutes before school 
starts, and our grounds for 15 minutes before school start
s, throughout the day, and 10 minutes after school. Access to the site during the instructional 
day is limited to the main office entrance, where procedures for student and visitor check
-
in/out are strictly enforced.
 
 
The District participates in the State
 
School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, p
lumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, and interior or exterior painting.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pup
il Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Staff members monitor the cafeteria for 25 minutes before school starts, and grounds for 15 minutes before school 
starts, throughout the day, and after 
school in addition to providing crosswalk coverage. Access to the site during the instructional day is limited to the main of
fice entrance, where procedures 
for student and visitor check
-
in/out are strictly enforced. T
he Raptor System is utilized for all parents, visitors, support staff, and contractors that are on 
campus during the instructional day.
 
 
Each teacher has an emergency folder containing vital information as well as contacts for each student. We hold monthly
 
fire drills, bi
-
annual lockdown 
drills, and participate in the Great American Shake
-
out to educate in the event of an earthquake.
 
 
Our District/school safety plan is reviewed regularly and revised as needed by the district safety coordinator. The safety p
lan is reviewed with staff and 
parent groups at the first scheduled meeting of the year.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
We provide our staff with regular training in core curricular areas, during a weekly 1.5
-
hour staff development period. 
Each week, teachers meet in grade
-
level groups or as a whole staff to review student work, plan instruction, and review teaching strategies. Staff may also att
end training sessions that 
address their specific interests and needs.  During the summer of 2017
 
two teachers were trained in Kevin Clark (EL training).
 
We are in our second year of training in the Kevin Clark EL strategies for the 18
-
19 year.   The training was based on current need as measured by the 
SBAC and local assessments.  Teachers are suppor
ted through in
-
class coaching and training, teacher
-
principal meetings, as well as coach/mentor 
meetings.  Roosevelt is an AVID Elementary School.  Teachers have attended training in San Diego.  Currently, five teachers h
ave gone to training.  These 
teache
rs are providing professional development to the staff.

-
wide staff development is largely dedicated to EDI (Explicit Direct Instruction).  The majority of professional development 
during the 2015

2016 and 2016

2019 school year the focus is on English Language Development with the training of staff in the methods promoted 
by Kevin C
lark Consulting. The focus remains on Kevin Clark Strategies in the 2019

velopment
