DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and 
data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally
 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the abil
ity to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Wildwood school. To ensure student safety, supervision is provided o

check in at the office.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is rev

of the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan include emergency evacuation procedures, District sexual harassment policies, a
nd codes of student beha
vior. 
The school is in compliance with all the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake

PUSD staff members build their knowledge of curriculum and their repertoire of 
instructional strategies by participating in various types of professional 
learning: local and national conferences, on and off
-
site workshops, coaching cycles, and as members of professional learning communities.  Prior to the 
2016
-
17 school year, the Dis
trict offered three staff development days annually where teachers were provided with a range of PD offerings on topics 
such as Common Core Standards training, differentiation, instructional technology, new math curriculum, and vertical alignmen
t of standa
rds instruction.
 
 
Beginning the 2016
-
17 school year, PUSD instituted a flexible professional development program, which allows all certificated staff to select th
e 
professional learning topic and structure that best fit their learning needs.  Some examples
 
of professional development selected by tri
-
school elementary 
teachers are as follows: differentiated math instruction, teaching reading in small groups, integrated learning, and social e
motional learning.
 
 
New teachers participate in a full day professio
nal development orientation and are assigned a mentor as part of the Teacher Induction Program (TIP) or 
may participate with Teachers Engaged in Active Mentoring (TEAM).  Tenured teachers can also participate in coaching by parti
cipating in Teachers 
Engage
d in Active Mentoring (TEAM).
