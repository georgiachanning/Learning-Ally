https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons
 
of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
lear
ners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a

About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional informat
ion about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

aff. It was last updated 
December 2019. Upon request, parents can 
access the plan in the school office.
 
 
The SSP outlines the appropriate responses necessary to respond to a variety of unusual or emergency situations including: ea
rthquake, fire, or 
unauthorized persons. Rio Vista conducts regular earthquake, fire, and lo
ckdown drills to prepare all students and staff for emergencies. To evaluate its 
effectiveness, a self
-
reflection and staff review accompanies each drill. The school maintains emergency supplies in a designated emergency bin. Fo
r the 
last eight years, Rio 
Vista has also participated in the Great California Shakeout 

 
a statewide earthquake preparedness activity and drill.
 
 
Through the El Rancho Student Services office, Rio Vista has partnered with community agencies to provide support to students
 
and famili
es with medical 
and mental health programs. Rio Vista also strives to maintain a positive school environment through the PBIS including: Char
acter Counts, Good Behavior 
Game (GBG) and Olweus bully prevention programs.
 
 
Rio Vista School is a closed campus. 
All visitors must enter and exit via the front school office and guests must sign
-
in prior to entering campus. Photo 
identification must be provided and verified prior to picking up students. School staff members supervise the playgrounds and
 
common areas 
throughout 
the school day. In addition, District police units are available to further ensure the safety of children before, during, and
 
after school. It is our goal to 
make Rio Vista School a safe and conducive environment for learning.
 
 
Rio Vista and the El Rancho Unified School District continue to work with outside partners and agencies through the Safe Scho
ols, Healthy Students 
partnerships to further enhance the overall safety of our campus and student community. Through these partner
ships students are provided access to 
community resources at the school site. This year we have expanded these offerings and have several groups working with stude
nts across all grade

The district provides professional learning opportunities to meet the needs of 
administrators, teachers, and support staff at all levels of the organization: 
Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment (BTSA); Peer Assistance Review (PAR) for veteran teachers; District and site admini
strators; Teachers and 
support staff; and Digital Le
arning Coaches.
 
 
Three full days and approximately 18 half days of professional learning were offered at our school sites in the 2018
-
19 school year. The topics addressed 

d district and school
-
wide action plans. Our intern teachers are 
supported by university supervisors. Professional development at individual school sites is determined by in
-
depth data analysis and aligned to the 
instructional focus areas. English learners
 
and special population training are offered on
-
site as needed. In addition, teachers and support staff also 
attend off
-
site workshops or conferences.
 
 
2018
-
19 Analysis of data led to the identification of professional learning priorities. Whole group inst
ruction, small group differentiated instruction, and 
designated English language development supported strengthening language arts instruction at the elementary level. Profession
al learning in 
mathematics focused on the Standards for Mathematics Practice, 
in conjunction with problem
-
solving and modeling and data analysis at the middle 
school level. At the high school, professional learning was prioritized for the Expository Reading and Writing Course which d
evelops students' academic 
literacy in rhetorical 
and analytical reading, writing, and thinking. All schools participated in professional learning opportunities centered on da
ta literacy. 
Professional development is provided during modified day schedules, pupil
-
free days, release days, and conferences/wor
kshops outside the district. 
Professional learning is supported through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, observations, and demonstration lessons.
