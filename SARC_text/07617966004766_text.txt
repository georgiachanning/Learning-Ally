By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Ford Elementary, students connect academics to the real
-
world to develop critical thinking skills and r
eceive 
individualized instruction and support to meet their unique needs in an environment that fosters community, 
perseverance, and kindness.
 
 
JO Ford Elementary School serves preschool through sixth grade students. The dedicated and reflective staff of F
ord School 
have high expectations for the students we serve and work beyond the call of duty to help students achieve success. We 
strive to provide a rigorous, culturally relevant, California Common Core State Standards
-
based, and research
-
based 
instructio
nal program. Our students will demonstrate 21st Century skills and abilities including critical thinking, problem 
solving, collaboration, and effective communication. Students will exhibit productive and responsible citizenship in an 
emotionally and physic
ally safe learning environment. Our teachers use data
-
driven and differentiated instruction to 
ensure maximum development of every student. We believe in the education of the Whole Child, academically, physically, 
socially, emotionally, and in terms of tal
ent development, and we enthusiastically celebrate the diversity of our 
community. In order to develop students' social and emotional skills, we implement a robust PBIS program model infused 
with Restorative Justice strategies, in which students are explic
itly taught behavioral expectations, rewarded for meeting 
behavioral expectations, and held accountable for their actions. We view all situations are learning opportunities and 
provide opportunities for students to learn from their mistakes.
 
 
Ford School i
s successful due to many factors; among them is our After School Program, our dedicated parent volunteers, 
PTA, and the Response
-
to
-
Intervention program which provides individualized and small group instruction. Our student 
government provides our students
 
with an opportunity to lead and provide the student voice to make our school 
successful. Students elect a mayor, vice mayor, and city council members who make recommendations for the operation 
of the school. With the addition of a School Community Outreac
h Worker, our goal is to greatly increase parental and 
community participation in our school as well as provide health and human services for families. At Ford Elementary, we 
strongly believe that it takes a village to raise a child, and we work as a team 
with all stakeholders in the best interest of 
our students

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools
 
are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure 
a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achie
vement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alter
nate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achieveme
nt standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a 
unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.

The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or ev
ent and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives 
of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to 
restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EO
C and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive 
School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School 
Safety plan will be available for revie

The instructional staff and administration are participating in Professional Development in a number of areas. Among 
them are: Unpacking and using the Common Core Standards, Use of Informational Text, Engagement Strategies, Lesson 
Study, Culturally Respons
ive Pedagogy and Frontloading Strategies (GLAD), and ongoing professional development and 
support of Teachers College Units of Study reading and writing program. Teachers can select specific local, state and 
sometimes national workshops to attend. The inst
ructional staff and administration are learning how to effectively 
differentiate instruction and implement Response to Intervention (RTI). Instructional Assistants and Tutors are trained by 
our District Reading/Language Arts/Specialist to assist with effec
tive literacy and "Tier 1" intervention strategies in the 
classrooms. Teachers also meet in grade
-
level groups to use data and collaboratively design standards
-
based lessons for 
each six to eight week unit of study across the curriculum. Creating grade lev
el formative assessments for foundational 
skills are constantly being developed by teachers based on the skills being taught. Rubrics are created to review writing 
and project
-
based learning. In addition to academics, Ford's staff is also learning about tr
auma
-
informed practices, 
Restorative Justice, PBIS, and social
-
emotional strategies for elementary students.
 
 
Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Educational Services 
Department engages teachers, administrators, and other personnel in ongoing professional 
development focused on improving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrators to 
improve their ability to provide strong instruct
ional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The 
principals, in turn, provide support to teachers through staff conferences, regularly scheduled grade
-
level opportunities 
for collaborative study and planning, and individual coaching ba
sed on ongoing classroom observations and teacher 
requests for support. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site professional development in all 
standards
-
based curriculum content areas. Professional development is provided in Englis
h Language Development, 
differentiated instruction, and educational technology. Training is also available in classroom management and the 
effective use of assessment data. A primary goal of the professional development program is ensuring that all student
s 
are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional 
leaders.
