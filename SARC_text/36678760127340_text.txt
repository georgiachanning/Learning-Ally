By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Brown Elementary School opened in fall of 2013 and 
currently offers a Dual Language Program for kindergarten through 
grades 4/5. The school has 32 classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, and an administration office. The facility strongly 
supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground 
space. The school also has professional office 
space for support staff (e.g., speech therapist, psychologist, and counselor).
 
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the di
stri

Mobile Maintenance Teams use the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California 

Operations
 
Department. The most recent inspection took place on 3/6/19. Below is more specific information on the 
condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with an appropate learning 
environment.
 
 
Safety
 
To ensure student s
afety before, during and after the school day, rec aides, teachers, and administrators supervise the 
school grounds including the cafeteria, quad area, and athletic fields.  Signs are posted throughout the campus to indicate 
all visitors must report to and
 
register in the administration office.  All staff and visitors wear appropriate identifying 
badges.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

are proactive a

each site reports safety issues as they arise.  Maintenance and Operations make necessary repairs to ensure that all 
schools are clean, safe, an
d functional.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority and work orders are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

nt works with the site principal or designee to develop cleaning runs 
for the site custodian(s). The site principal/designee then works with the site custodian(s) to ensure proper 
implementation of the cleaning runs to maintain a safe and clean school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Every student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To help schools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 
safety plan.  Reviewe

local public safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, and other persons interested 
in the prevention of campus crime
 

preparedness, mitigation and prevention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 

sites and provides correction reports to site administrators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction 
of discrepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills for anticipated emergency situations (such as fires, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district
 
follows 

System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Safety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and rec
overy of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of
 
all categorically funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupi
ls, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support sta
ff, parents, and students (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
s
tudy and collaboration, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state
 
and local content standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instruction
al program and increase the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Ca
tegorical programs commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:

Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions
 
that are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of 
data, including local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and s
tudent groups in need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
