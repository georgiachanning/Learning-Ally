School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
The vision of the Garden School community is to provide the support services and instructional 
strategies that will enable all students, including those with special needs and English Language 
Learners, to realize their potential as lea
rners in a positive , safe and secure environment. Included 
in that vision is the commitment to a strong instructional program based on the direction of the 
state standards and curriculum frameworks, articulated consistently among all grade levels, 
deliver
ed in an effective manner, and supported by adequate resources.
 
 
Our commitment to parent involvement and utilization of community resources will enable our 
students to transition from home to the school environment with ease. Combining high academic 
and b
ehavioral expectations while accommodating individual social and emotional needs will allow 
every student the opportunities they need to achieve. The staff at Garden School strives to make a 
difference in all of the lives of the children we serve so they w
ill become successful, lifelong 
learners. Garden School serves over 685 preschool through sixth grade students in the Tulare City 
School District. We are proud to be one of four Tulare City School District schools recognized as a 
California Distinguished S
chool in recent years.We are also proud to be on the CBEE State Honor 
Roll as a star school that has proven to be closing the achievement gap.
 
 
Garden School believes in the importance of teaching and reinforcing positive behaviors. At 
Garden, we support "
DIGS;" D
-
 
do the right thing; I
-
 
I own my actions; G
-
 
Give respect; S
-
 
support 
others. These qualities of character are taught, reinforced and monitored on a daily basis.
 
 
Garden School has tremendous parent involvement. We encourage parent volunteers at e
very 
grade level to be involved in an active way in the education of their student at school. Every 
trimester parents, students, and teachers from each classroom attend the Awards Assembly where 
we recognize outstanding citizens. Our PTO and SSC/ELAC group
s meet regularly. The PTO Fall 
Carnival is always a huge success, with hundreds of people every year in attendance. Our parent 
surveys indicated overwhelming positive support for Garden School.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by stat
e 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requir
ed to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to 
be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For 
more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact 
the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Garden School has a Safe School Plan that is in place and updated yearly by the School Safety Committee, an offshoot of the S
cho
ol Site Council and 
Garden's Leadership Team. Evacuation drills are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that staff and students know what to d
o in an emergency. A Cal
-
OSHA representative attends monthly meetings and provides updates to staff on safety a
nd health issues. In addition to these programs, adequate 
supervision is provided before school, during break/recess, at lunch, and after school, and is noted on the school's duty sch
edule.
 
 
All Tulare City School District facilities are supportive of teac
hing and learning. Classrooms are clean, orderly, and provide a safe learning environment 
reflective of student work and current curriculum. Garden School has a school cafeteria that provides students with a breakfa
st and lunch program and 
is used as a mul
tipurpose facility for large
-
scale programs and meetings. The school library provides students with supplemental reading materials and 
provides additional educational resources.
 
 
We take pride in our well
-
maintained buildings and landscaping. The Tulare Ci
ty School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe, clean 
environment throughout the school year. Students, staff, and parents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter fre
e.
 
 
The Tulare City School District provides ongoing maint
enance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and portable buildings to guarantee all 
schools in the district are in good working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for pupils are main
tained so they are functional 
and m
eet local hygiene standards generally applicable to public facilities, including operational toilets and sinks in all restroo
ms. The district has 
established a facilities inspection system to ensure that all school buildings meet the standards listed above
.
 
 
Garden School's grounds, buildings, and restrooms are kept clean, safe, and are regularly maintained. The school has a mornin
g custodian from 6:30 A.M. 
to 3:30 P.M. and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. The custodians are regularly monit
ored and evaluated by the building principal and 
director of custodians to make sure that all schools are safely maintained and cleaned. In addition to the assigned school cu
stodians, the district has a 
general maintenance crew that takes care of the more 
technical repairs (plumbing, heating and cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, painting, major repairs, 
and so on). At times, the district will hire independent contractors to handle repairs that may be beyond the scope of the di
strict's resources. Repairs 
are 
made on an ongoing basis, and the district has a work order repair procedure that begins with the school principal referring 
needed repairs that cannot 
be taken care of by the custodians to the district superintendent. The superintendent assigns the re
pairs to the maintenance director who, in turn, assigns 
the work out to the different maintenance specialists. Work orders are completed on a timely basis. Each school also has a sc
hool site safety 
representative that attends ongoing safety meetings. The s
chool district also has a Superintendent's Advisory Committee that meets on a regular basis 
with the district superintendent to discuss questions or concerns.
 
 
The Garden School campus is over 60 years old, with 53,054 square feet, and includes 37 
classrooms and one Resource Specialist Program (RSP) room. 
All of our classrooms have Internet access along with the library. Our library has five computer stations and approximately 2
5,000 books for checkout. 
We have undergone the modernization of four cl
assroom wings in 1987, and two classroom wings and office area in 2003. During the past three years, 
Garden's PTO has donated funds to beautify the campus flowerbeds and library area.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
