School Description
 
The mission is proficiency for all children.
 
 
Enrollment at our charter school totaled 825 students for the 2018
-
19 school year. Bowling Green 
offers two small learning communities: Chacon 
Language & Science Academy and The McCoy 
Academy of Excellence.  BG shall admit all students who wish to attend Bowling Green Elementary 
and who submit a timely application, unless BG receives a greater number of applications than 
there are spaces for stud
ents, in which case each application will be given a chance of admission 
through a public random drawing process. Enrollment preferences will meet all legal requirements, 

ed by 
Education Code Section 47605(d)(2), admission to BG shall not be determined according to the 
place of residence of the student or his or her parents within the State. Preference in the public 
random drawing shall be given as required by Education Cod
e Section 47605(d) (2) (B). In the event 
of a drawing, the chartering authority shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the growth 
of BG in accordance with Education Code Section 47605(d)(2)(C). [Ref. Education Code Section 
47605(d)(2)(A)
-
(B)]
 
 
Return
ing students must complete a reservation form annually to indicate their intent to return.
 
 

Ken McCoy Academy for Excellence focus is on Looping with students in grades 2 
-
 
5 staying with 
the same teacher for two years and the Chacon Language and Scie
nce Academy with a Spanish 
Immersion program.
 
 
Both learning communities focus on the development of a balanced rigorous curriculum and the 
development of social character. The social skills curriculum includes teaching students how to 
resolve conflict, ho
w to employ Social Emotional Learning character strengths, and how to believe 
that if you work hard you can get smarter. We believe that smart is something you become, not 
something you have when you are born.  Teachers support students by providing them a
 
safe 
learning environment.  Students are expected to meet Common Core State Standards at all grade 
levels. Students are moved from knowledge to higher order thinking by having them prove and 
disprove their responses providing evidence of their thinking pr
ocess.

About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional informat
ion about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members represent
ing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet curr
ent curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the ado
ption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered te
xtbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Bowling Green Elementary School, built in 1957, received Facility Inspection Tool (FIT

inspection in June 2018.  The district governing Board has adopted cleanliness standards for all district schools to ensure t
hat all schools are clean, safe 
and functional.  The district
 
Operations Department takes great pride following a work order process that provides efficient and timely services to all the
 
sites.  The principal works directly with the site custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure that the school is
 
cle
an and safe.
 
 

ols.  The district performed 
Quick Strike projects during the summer of 2014, which allowed schools to pick from one 
of the following improvements: 1) marquees, 2) closed
-
circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior painting, or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire a
larms at all the district schools 
were upgraded.  Additional 10 milli
on dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to begin in 2019.
 
 
Funding from the federal government through Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) provided for technology infrastru
cture improvements 
to the di

room internet 
access and digital voice communication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priorit
y: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sm
arter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligib
le students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.

Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
