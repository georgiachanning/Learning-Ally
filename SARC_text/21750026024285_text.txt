Description
 
White Hill Middle School is a California Distinguished School that serves the communities of San 
Anselmo and Fairfax. It is the Ross Valley School District's sole middle school for6th, 7th, and 8th 
grade students from our communities' four elem
entary school.
 
 
Located on the western edge of Fairfax at the base of White's Hill, the school campus is surrounded 
by beautiful rolling hills and open space and sits on a 22
-
acre site that includes Lefty Gomez Field. 
White Hill was built in 1969 and has g
one through three major renovations (1985, 2000 and 2013).
 
 
White Hill Middle School is a community of learners that promotes excellence, respectful behavior, 
perseverance, and social emotional growth. Students and staff work together to maintain high 
stan
dards of responsibility, independence, and self
-
advocacy.
 
 
Shared Agreements
 

 
We will learn how to implement and utilize restorative justice practices in classrooms 
and outside on the campus.
 

 
The counseling department will offer staff opportunities to discu
ss topics that promote 
social emotional health. These will occur during lunch, on professional development 
Wednesdays, and PD days
 

 

classrooms and learn about teaching 
strategies that promote rigorous instruction.
 
 
Our goals are to encourage critical thinking, independent decision making, engagement in 
productive struggle, problem solving, and perseverance. 
 

 
We agree that shared agreements are dynamic, should be regularl
y revisited, and 
measured to be effective.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Ross Valley School District passed a $41 million dollar bond in November 2010 to accommodate increased enrollment and at 
White Hill Middle 
School.
 
 
Ross Valley School District uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM
) strategies and the least toxic method of pest control possible as a means to control 
unwanted pests. In accordance with AR 3514.2 IPM strategy focuses on long
-
term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of 
techniques such as mon
itoring for pest presence and establishing treatment threshold levels, using non
-
chemical practices to make the habitat less 
conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the
 
least
 
possible hazard 
and are effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful monit
oring indicates they are 
needed according to established guidelines and treatment thresholds. ( California Educati
on Code §17609; Food and Agricultural Code§ 13181)

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority
 
4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

k the 
form of a mini
-
conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Int
egration 
Techniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Addit
ionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who 
are in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.
 
During the 2018
