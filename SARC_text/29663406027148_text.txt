By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Seven Hills School is a fifth through eighth grade school that serves the students in Nevada City and the su
rrounding areas. 
Seven Hills School enjoys a strong academic reputation, balanced with an exciting enrichment program that supports 

 
 
The fifth and sixth grades are self
-
contained with students moving during the da
y to math and enrichment classes. In the 
seventh and eighth grade, students have a homeroom teacher, who serves as their first period teacher. After homeroom, 
students move throughout the day to math, science, PE and Humanities (English/Language Arts and h
istory). Humanities 
is a two period core program that focuses on English Language Arts instruction and the history being studied at that grade 
level. Seventh graders study the Medieval and Renaissance time periods. Eighth graders study United States histor
y 
beginning with the founding of the colonies and moving through the Civil War and Reconstruction.
 
 
All four grade levels have major academic projects that focus on the history curriculum. The fifth graders do a States 
Project. The Sixth graders participat
e in the International Cultural Event. Seventh graders have a simulation history event 
titled the Medieval Feast. Eight grade students complete the U.S. Constitution test. Other subject area projects occur in 
Science, Math and Physical Education. Elective 
offerings include Band, Choir, Art, Garden, Technology/STEAM (4 classes), 
the Bicycle Recycle Project, Spanish, Leadership, Health, Drama, and Academic Advisory classes.
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Seven Hills Middle School is a community of students, parents, t
eachers and volunteers that pride themselves on 
transitioning children from elementary school to the rigors of being a high school student. We feel that students gain the 
academic skills and a healthy sense of their potential by being challenged in a rigor
ous and creative environment.
 
 

young people. The daily course of study provides equal time for the five core areas of English, history, math
, science and 
physical education; while also providing a strong influence in the visual and performing arts, technology and enrichment 
courses.
 
 
Students have a strong connection to the daily activities of the school through their homeroom class. The homer
oom 
teacher is the daily connection that each student has to the school and provides a portal for home school communications. 
Parental involvement in daily school activities is strongly encouraged. The Seven Hills Middle School program addresses 
the needs 
of the whole child, and lessons in responsibility and decision
-
making are as important as lessons in mathematics, 
reading, writing and the arts.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
Seven 
Hills Middle School was originally constructed in 1971 and is currently comprised of 27 classrooms (including 
portables), a library, a computer lab, three science labs, one athletic field, one paved area for sports, a 
theater/cafeteria/multipurpose room, a
 
band room, a fitness room, the bicycle recycling facility, and the main office.
 
 
In January 2006, a $2.5 million modernization project was completed at Seven Hills Middle School. All classrooms and the 
gymnasium received extensive upgrades including, but 
not limited to, new lighting and flooring. The library was also 
expanded, new staff work and preparations facilities were added, and outdoor structures were erected to provide 
students additional shelter from the elements during their breaks.
 
 
Seven Hills 
Middle School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district governing 
board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis throughout the sc
hool year with emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff 
helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The Principal works daily with two custodians to develop sanitation schedules 
that ensure a clean, safe, and functio
nal learning environment.

heavy maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program 
is 
administered by Nevada City School District to ensure that school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work 
order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; 
repai
r requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
The following improvements are being considered for 2018
-
2019: Improvements to the playing fields and new landscaping 
to the front of school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide ass
essments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for Englis
h language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked wit
h the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and t
he California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
