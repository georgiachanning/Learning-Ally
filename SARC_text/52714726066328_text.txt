About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The Antelope School District sets a high priority on providing sufficient textbooks to support each school's instructional pr
ogram. Adoptions are conducted

by subject in an effort to ensure instructional materials are always current. All adopted textbooks and instructional materia
l 
programs meet state standards and have been adopted by the State Board of Education and the Antelope School District  governi
ng b
oard.  The availability 
of sufficient state
-
adopted and standards
-
aligned textbooks for each pupil, including English learners, for use in class and to take home are consistent 
with the content and cycles of the curriculum frameworks adopted by the Califor
nia State Board of Education in all core curriculum areas.

ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California Stat
e University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):

pertaining to hazardous materi
als and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was recently updated  by the School Safety Committee. 
All revisions were communicated to both the classified and certificated staff.
 
 

 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a 
regular basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held as needed. Students are supervised before and after school
 
by classified and
