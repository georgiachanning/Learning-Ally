School Description
 
Monte Verde Elementary School has had a long history of establishing high standards and 
expectations for students while being able to 
support individual success. This can only be 
accomplished by knowing each child well and by working cooperatively with the home.
 
 
As part of a Unified School District, Monte Verde Elementary School is able to provide students the 
foundation needed to succe
ed. We participate in district initiatives and adhere to established rules 
and regulations while maintaining the ability to exercise site
-
based management. We offer an 
ambitious and rigorous academic program to all our students. Our academic program 
acknow
ledges the needs of our learners. The Academic Support Program, Speech and Language 
Program and Literacy Lab are intricate parts in addition to our general education program. Each 
year a Plan for Student Achievement is developed by staff, with input from t
he community. It is 
aligned with district initiatives, focused on success for all children and based on identified needs. 
This plan guides our work and helps determine funding priorities.
 
 
As a community of learners we value our partnerships with local uni
versities. Through them we 
gain student teachers Notre Dame de Namur and students from San Francisco State University.
 
 
We are proud of our school, students, staff and community.

About the SARC
 
By February 
1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding F
ormula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and l
ocal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school,
 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible stu
dents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
