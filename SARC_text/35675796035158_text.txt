By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Willow Grove Union School District is a small, singl
e
-
school, rural district in southern San Benito County. Our student 
population has ranged from 10
-
18 students over the past few years. For the 2019
-
20 school year, we are starting the year 
with 11 students attending the school. The district has approximate
ly eighty
-
five percent English Language Learners and 
ninety percent low income students.  The single school district currently employs two credentialed teachers.
 
 
As a Kindergarten to 8th grade district, we do not administer the California High School Exit 
Exam (CAHSEE), Early 
Assessment Program exam or Advance Placement (AP) exams, offer A
-
G classwork or Career Technical Education (CTE) 
Pathways as defined by the State of California, or receive a California Department of Education (CDE) calculation for 
grad
uation rate, and dropout rate. These metrics are not used in our LCAP.  However, we direct our teaching towards each 
student to enable them to successfully matriculate to high school and be prepared to pass the CAHSEE, EAP, A
-
G/CTE 
courses, and graduate hi
gh school.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the Sta
te priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Willow 
Grove Board of Trustees recognizes that the district is a vital part of the whole community and seeks to involve 
not only parents but the larger community in its life. We firmly believe that parent/community involvement is essential to 
the success of the d
istrict, the school, the staff, the students and the vitality of the community.  Parents and community 
members are invited, encouraged and welcome to participate in all aspects of the school and district.
 
 
Willow Grove district is governed by a 5
-
member sc
hool board comprised of parent and/or community members elected 
by the Willow Grove voters or appointed by the Local Board. The School Board follows and implements the tenants of the 
California School Board Association, the California Department of Educati
on, and the laws and regulations governing public 
schools. The School Board holds monthly public meetings. A calendar of meetings is published and sent out to the parents 
and posted for the larger community.  Reminders of meetings are sent to parents month
ly. Agendas of meetings are 
published and posted to encourage parent/community involvement in governance issues.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) is a formal committee made up parents/ community members, principal, and staff.  The 
School Site Council 
meets regularly primarily to discuss issues related to student achievement and to make 
recommendations to the School Board for school improvements. SSC meetings are announced in the monthly calendar, 
agendas are posted, and parents are encouraged to partic
ipate. In 2015
-
16 onward, the SSC meetings were expanded to 
include a Parent Teacher Organization for fundraising and other functions not covered by the SSC.
 
 
Adult education events are provided by the district every year to increase parent/community invol
vement; to increase 
understanding of the education process; and to provide assistance to parents in helping their children learn.  In addition 
to adult education events, parents and community members are invited to attend student events which showcase stud
ent 
achievement and provide parent discussion times as a group, such as Open House, Parent Teacher Planning for the School, 
a Holiday Program and a Spring End of Year gathering.   This year parents are also invited to participate in family learning 
activit
ies such as Family Math Night, in which children and their parents work together on solving math challenges, Science 
Night, during which students and their parents conduct hands
-
on science experiments together.   Events are often held in 
the evening and a 
full dinner, snack or a desert are arranged to make it easier for parents and community members to 
attend.   In addition, a monthly newsletter is sent home with a calendar of events for the upcoming month (fields trips, 
parent nights, vacation times etc.).
  
Parents are involved in the decision making regarding the school year calendar to 
facilitate better attendance with the families' travels outside of the regular school days.
 
 

ng)  formal parent/teacher conferences are 
held whereby teachers and parents can discuss areas of achievement and concern.   Parents are  kept informed regarding 




e and 
feedback. Teachers have daily informal verbal communication with parents during drop off and pick up times.

During the last three years, the major 
areas of focus for staff development have been math, reading, and science. Student 
work samples and assessment results were used to determine the need for professional development in these three areas. 
In addition, teachers expressed a desire to increase t
heir content knowledge in math, technology and science and to learn 
the most effective strategies for teaching in all three areas. As a result of training the following improvements have been 
made to the instructional program: 1.) the assessment program co
nsists of assessing students every 6
-
8 weeks where 
results are used for teacher planning and instruction; 2.) a leveled reading program, guided reading and a new Language 
Arts Program as the primary mode of reading instruction for all grades; 3.) Chrome bo
oks are used in all classes for student 
instruction and most assessments.

Teachers received most of their staff development training at school or county workshops (prior to school starting, release 
time, early days or at co
nferences). Teachers are given several days per year for educational planning including input and 
collaboration with the administration. Teachers are formally observed and evaluated annually by a specialist assigned by 
the San Benito County of Education us
ing the California State Standards for the Teaching Profession. Together, the teacher 

Development Plan is the continual growth of the teacher know
ledge and skills in order to more effectively meet the needs 
of their students. 
 
 
Professional development was extended to the clerical staff this year for Aires program and CALPADS trainings.
