By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
College Park Elementary School 

 
located in the village of College Park 

 
has an enrollment of approximately 715
 
students in grades K
-
6. Although the majority of students speak English, a large number of students come from a variety 
of ethnic backgrounds and speak many different languages. This international population, coupled with a number of 
students with special
 
needs, creates a rich and diverse student body. At College Park, our diverse population is embraced, 
different cultural backgrounds are appreciated, and character development is encouraged. College Park students truly live 
and receive a global education. 
 
Our school has two special programs 

 
the newcomer program for students with an English 
Language Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC) (Scoring at the Novice or Minimally Developed level on the ELPAC) 
and the Behavior and Social Learning Center (B
SLC) for students across the district who struggle with behavior and social 

technical skills necessary to succeed in the world of tomor
row. As a result, we hope that students will become more 
innovative, develop a "Growth Mindset," develop the skills necessary to think and express themselves clearly and acquire 
the values necessary to act well, appreciate life and contribute to society.
 
 
The College Park staff, parents, and surrounding community share a common vision. High
-
quality classroom instruction, 
students who are motivated to learn, a warm and nurturing learning environment, and a supportive and encouraging 
parent
-
community help to 
make College Park a wonderful place to learn and work. It is our goal that all students will leave 
College Park able to read, write, and compute at high levels. By accomplishing this goal, students are afforded the 
opportunity to experience academic succes
s at the next level and beyond. To ensure this success, the College Park staff is 
dedicated to using sound instructional practices and high
-
quality instructional materials. This includes the integration of 
technology and innovative practices throughout the
 
curriculum. Our instructional programs combine explicit skill 
instruction, such as phonics and mathematics skills, and instruction that is embedded within a meaningful context. 

logy, including Internet access, and a large 
inventory of instructional computer software, including a video
-
editing and production program, in addition to our new 
and growing innovation lab.
 
 

 

students with an environment that encourages respect, responsibility, integrity, and safety that we are able to be 
successful with our mission.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
College Park welcomes
 
and values our volunteer parents.  Without volunteers, many programs and activities that are 
offered at our school would not be possible.  Our volunteers and Parent Teacher Association are involved heavily within 
our school. They are involved in assisting
 

providing other family and school
-
related programs and special projects. The school and district continually seek business 
partnerships that can supplement school programs and pr
ovide curriculum support and computer equipment through 
donations. School funding, parent volunteer, and the Irvine Public Schools Foundation donations are utilized to purchase 
additional curriculum support materials and programs.
 
 
College Park Elementary 
School has implemented a visitor check
-
in system. This system allows us to track visitors or 
volunteers who visit our school and in turn, provide us with a safer environment for students and staff. Part of keeping 
students and faculty safe involves knowing
 
who is in our building at all times and this process allows us to do that. When 
parents arrive on campus, they are asked to present a valid state
-
issued ID or passport. Their name, date of birth, and 
photo are compared against the county, state, and natio
nal database of registered sex offenders. The information they 
provide is confidential and is not be used for any other purpose than this safety screening. Once they have done this initial
 
check with a front office staff member, returning visitors are able
 
to use a self
-
service kiosk. Many parents volunteer for 
fundraising events such as our Dolphin Dash and our World's Fair run by our fabulous PTA who also hosts family nights 
and other great events that help build our community. Parents are involved in our
 
School Site Council and on our 
PBIS/MTSS team. They help our teachers by offering input into our school's structures which identify students in need of 
academic, behavioral, and social
-
emotional intervention.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
College Park Elementary School has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan that is reviewed each year and has been recently 
approved by our
 
district. We conduct a yearly disaster drill to test our plan's effectiveness and to ready staff for a 
catastrophic event. This plan reviews and assesses the school status of a safe and orderly environment, safe ingress and 
egress of students and adults, 
school rules and procedures, policies relating to suspension and expulsion, required teacher 
notification of student disciplinary and safety concerns, and the current status of school crime and disaster procedures. In 
addition to practicing monthly disaste
r drills and housing extensive emergency supplies and equipment, the school is 
equipped with food and water on hand for each student.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of 
state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTA
L 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide 
summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English
 
language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technolog
y support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 10) Additional secondary sections to reduce class size, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site st

Fi
nally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provided to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for conce
ntration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

The College Park School Site Council updates our school 
improvement plan annually, establishing goals for training and 
curriculum improvement that support the school, district, and state goals. The School Site Council also collaborates on the 
use of school site funds to support curriculum and staff development 
activities related to our school plan.
 
 
College Park Elementary School and the Irvine Unified School District are committed to continuous improvement, including 
professional improvement. We continue to develop strategies and practices that differentiate in
struction to better meet 
student needs through the Professional Learning Communities model. Teachers unpack the Common Core Standards, 
create/ modify assessments to meet those standards, and use data to drive instruction accordingly. Professional 
developme
nt topics are chosen based on data and instructional practice need (ie: enrichment, working with students with 
specific learning needs, such as speech and language deficits, autism, mental health concerns, etc.). In many cases, 
teachers are given opportuni
ties to choose specific sessions that match teacher needs and interests during the 
Professional Development designated time.  In addition to the two full days of staff development and six two
-
hour staff 
development sessions, teacher training is provided mo
nthly at staff meetings through district
-
sponsored trainings. Also, 
attendance by individual teachers or groups of teachers at educational conferences provided outside the Irvine Unified 
School District is encouraged.
