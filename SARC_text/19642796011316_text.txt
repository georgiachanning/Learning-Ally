About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains informat
ion about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 
intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC require
ments, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

supplies for use during a disaster. All visitors must sign in at the front office, wear identification tags while on the scho
ol grounds and sign out up
on 
departure. Certificated and administration are on duty during recess and before school, and noon supervisors are on duty duri
ng lunch and at dismissal 
to ensure the safety of all our students. Teachers, staff, and administrators are trained and practice
 
lock down procedures that can secure the entire 
campus in an emergency.

students and staff a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the 
following: monthly facility safety inspections, child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupils pr
ocedures, disaster
 
response 
procedures, procedures for safe entering and exiting from school, sexual harassment policy, suspension and expulsion policies
, dress code, and discipline 
policies. The Safe School Committee evaluates the plan annually in the Spring and updates th
