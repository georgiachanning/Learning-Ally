Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Miguel has a staff dedicated to ongoing professional development and continuous inquiry. At the core of this 
dedication is a belief that collaboration is key to student achievement. Student data is used as a guide in a
djusting 
instruction. Conversations focus on working with every student by name and need. We look to creating life long learners 
who are community
-
minded. The school offers rigorous academic instruction in all the core subject areas. Gifted and 
Talented In
struction, intervention, English Language Development, and arts education are provided to students as 
determined by student need and interest. Student progress is monitored through the use of formative assessments and 
staff meets three times per year to re
view student results. In these meetings, teachers will discuss next steps in classroom, 
intervention, and GATE instruction. Additionally staff comes together once a month for school
-
specific professional 
development such as technology integration, common c
ore implementation, and school safety. In all of these professional 
development opportunities, staff demonstrates their dedication to collaboration and working in partnership with students 
and families to improve teaching and learning.
 
 
School wide positiv
e behavior management is embraced by teachers, students, yard duty supervisors, and community. 
There are weekly assemblies, in which students are honored for demonstrating character traits.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
Our students will receive an extraordinary educa
tion that will empower them to achieve their personal best, be prepared 
for the challenges of the future, and become socially responsible, contributing members of our local and global 
communities.

[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu

students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Miguel Charter School has a comprehensive school safety plan that follows SIMS and NEMS guidelines. It is in line with 
the Mark West 
District Safety Plan. The plan is reviewed at the beginning of each school year with the entire staff. Safety 
inspections are done routinely by the maintenance department, especially prior to school opening.
 
 
The staff roles in case of an emergency are out
lined in the comprehensive plan. A "flip
-
book" of emergency responses for 
various situations and drill procedures are kept in an obvious location in each classroom. Classrooms and all common 
areas (library, computer lab, and MPR, for example) are equipped 
with a red emergency bag containing first aid supplies.
 
 
Fire, earthquake and shelter
-
in
-
place drills are practiced routinely.
 
 
Each year, the San Miguel Charter School Site Council reviews the District Safety and Wellness plans and policy and also 
they re
view the San Miguel Charter School BEST Plan. The San Miguel Charter School BEST Plan is the behavior expectation 
and discipline plan for the school. BEST is an acronym for Building Effective Schools Together. It is a system, which gives 
staff, students, a
nd community a structure to support strong character development, expected behaviors, and have fair 
discipline consequences. We look at discipline data, target areas for student training, and celebrate student successes. 
BEST is research
-
based and builds f

 
 
School personnel will support appropriate student behavior to nurture a safe, caring, compassionate, and collaborative 
learning environment. Student choices and consequences for not following school behavior 
expectations will follow school 
and district policy.

Positive Discipline is based on the following principles: mutual respect (I respect myself and I respect you), all people str
ive 
for belonging and significance, mistakes are opportunities to learn, logi
cal and natural consequences that are reasonable, 
related, and respectful help people ow  and grow from mistakes, and children will develop competencies when we provide 
them with responsibilities and support. Violations of expectations will be addressed in
 
a positive, respectful, reasonable 
and related manner. Keeping in mind that mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow, consequences will be issued on 
a severity continuum and can include a conference with the teacher, phone call to the parent, written 
reflection or 
apology, conflict mediation, behavior plan, loss of privileges, suspension, or expulsion.

Our staff development program is aligned 

personnel throughout the district to plan together and attend workshops on best practices for standards based 
instruction. With the state adoption of the Common Core State St
andards and a shift in assessment to a computer based 
assessment, the primary focus for staff development has been implementation of the Common Core State Standards. In 
support of our English Language Learners, staff has received additional training in ass
isting EL's in meeting the CCSS. In 
alignment with our Strategic Plan, the district has provided support in the form of a Project Based Learning support teacher 
who goes into each classroom coaching and supporting teachers in planning and implementing proj
ect based learning in 
the classroom. All staff are receiving training and support in the area of Social Emotional Wellbeing through our Director 
of Student Services and Counselor. The district relies heavily on the support of the County Office of Education
, which 
provides a wide range of professional development opportunities in implementation of CCSS and Next Generation Science 
Standards (NGSS). We utilize early release days, known as "site days" and "district days" as well as faculty meetings to 
provide t
raining for staff. With the adoption of a new Common Core aligned math program, an area of focus during early 
release days has been in support of mathematics. A new English Language Arts curriculum is currently being implemented 
during the 2019
-
2020 school
 
year. All new teachers participate in the North Coast Teacher Induction Program through 
Sonoma County Office of Education during their first two years of teaching. These classes are held after school hours and 
each new teacher is assigned an experienced m
entor for the entire process. More experienced teachers participate in 
training according to their needs and interests.
