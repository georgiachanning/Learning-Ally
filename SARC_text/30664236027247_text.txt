Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 99.57% Overall rating: EXEMPLARY
 
 
General:
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, 
the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. 
Safety
 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Re
pair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have hig
hest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each s
chool site. 
Cleaning schedules are developed jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since 

mont
hs all schools are being deep cleaned on a rotation schedule.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
