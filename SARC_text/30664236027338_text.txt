Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

and children excel.
 
 
The mission of James Madison School is to improve student learning and achievemen

It is the vision of James Madison School to create a Professional Learning Community that inspires all families, school,

potential.
 
 
In pursuit of this vision, James Madison School will:
 

 
Provide an instructional program that meets or exceeds the standards in all subject areas to prepare students to 
be productive ci
tizens and lifelong learners;
 

 
Continue to build and nurture an enthusiastic and collaborative staff;
 

 
Create an atmosphere that promotes a desire to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially and that respects 
the worth and dignity of every individual;
 

 
Provide safe facilities which enhance and encourage the learning process;
 
 
Base the use of new ideas and techniques on a foundation of best teaching practices, guided by regular assessments;
 
Provide frequent opportunities for parent and community involveme
nt in the educational process and school activities.
 
A number of special services are provided to students on an as
-
needed basis beyond the regular classroom. GATE classes 
or
 
 
cluster classes are provided for students in grades three through six who met di
strict criteria and choose to be in an 
all day GATE placement. In addition to the required core curriculum, our English Language Learners are provided with 
English Language Development (ELD) daily. Madison also offers a school
-
wide intervention, Reading Ro
tations, to 
address the needs of students in flexible, skill
-
based groups by providing 30 minutes of intensive, standards
-
based 
instruction on the specific skills needed by each student. Teachers frequently perform data analysis in order to plan and 
differ
entiate according to students' needs.
 
 
The Title I Targeted Assistance Program provides services to eligible children identified by the school as most at risk of 
failing to meet the state's academic content standards. Services may include 1) extended learn
ing time opportunities, 2) 
accelerated, high quality instructional materials, 3) services to assist preschool children transition to kindergarten, 4) 
staff development, and 5) parental involvement and family literacy services.
 
 
The Resource Specialist Prog
ram serves students with specific learning disabilities whose Individual Education Plans 
require a minimal placement in special education with most education occurring in the regular classroom setting. The 
Speech and Language Specialist provides support fo
r students with articulation and/or language disorders. Students 
identified with emotional and/or behavioral needs in their IEP receive Educationally Related Mental Health Services.
 
Student learning is also supported with the part time Behavioral Health Ai

provide counseling support/referrals for students and families experiencing personal challenges.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Inspection Date: 10/01/2019
 
 
Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 99.74% Overall rating: EXEMPLARY
 
 
General:
 
 
The District takes great effort to 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the District 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis 
at all sites.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient s
ervice. Emergency 
repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus once every week. No 
emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
 
The District has standard cleaning proce
dures and guidelines used at each school site. Cleaning schedules are developed 
jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since January of 2006, the District has 
implemented the "General Deep Cleaning" crew proced
ure. On average, once every 10 months all schools are being deep 
cleaned on a rotation schedule.
 
 
The District's completed deferred maintenance plan is available at the Operations Center at 1411 S. Anaheim Blvd. 
Anaheim, CA 92805.

lation and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are a
ligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy th
e requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

coaching framework and maximize individual
ized professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
planning/teaching, PLCs, peer learning walks and provide professional learning.
 
 
Professional Learning areas of focused are identified through analysis of both formative and summative data.
 
 
All 
unduplicated student groups ELA and Math summative data as reported by summative and interim CAASPP test items
