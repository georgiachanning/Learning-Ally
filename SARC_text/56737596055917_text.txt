By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

instructional, cultural, and fiscal decisions.  Our motto, "Ded

SCHOOL DESCRIPTION
 
Walnut Elementary is a neighborhood school serving approximately 300 students, TK
-
5th grade, in picturesque Newbury 
Park, CA.  We 
value the family feel on our campus and we are proud of our multicultural student body.  Our most important 
goals at Walnut are the academic and social development of our students. Walnut's devoted staff members share a 
common philosophy of excellence in i
nstruction, high expectations, and the belief that the elementary experience sets 
the foundation for a lifetime of learning.  As the recipient of a Title 1 grant, Walnut benefits from extra federal funding 
used to increase student performance and shrink ac
hievement gaps. We hire additional credentialed teachers to provide 
small group intervention and enrichment.  In the spirit of collaboration, all teachers regularly meet in professional learnin
g 
communities for professional development, data analysis, and 
instructional discussions, pinpointing how to better meet 
students' academic and behavioral needs.  The teaching staff has implemented a school
-
wide intervention program called 
Target Time, which provides 30 minutes of daily, targeted, small group interven
tion for every student in grades 1
-
5. These 
skills
-
based groups are determined by assessment data and are reevaluated each trimester.  Each small group is taught by 
a credentialed teacher using research
-
based curriculum and provides a "just right" fit of r
emediation, deeper practice, or 
enrichment. In order to support students in the social
-
emotional arena, our school counselor uses Target Time once per 
week to offer flexible social skills groups. Additional interventions on campus include after school clas
ses, a credentialed 
academic specialist dedicated to our Kindergarten program, and individualized computer programs that may also be 
accessed at home.  A strong, integrated visual and performing arts program enhances the core curriculum. Walnut invests 
in 
specialists to teach art, music, dance, computer technology, and physical education classes for additional enrichment.  
Students gain digital fluency working with a variety of digital devices, and our free after
-
school Coding Club is extremely 
popular. We 
also offer a Create Club recess option that allows students to use their imaginations to create art projects 
with recycled materials.
 
 
Walnut provides a nurturing, disciplined, and caring learning community. All staff members train in the CHAMPS Positive 
B
ehavior Intervention System, which is evident campus
-
wide in classrooms and common areas. Students follow our 

elementary school counselors and tau
ght throughout the year to fifth grade students, promotes positive character traits 
including responsibility, acceptance, and trustworthiness. We continue to implement the concept of Bucket Filling, based 
on the book, Have You Filled a Bucket Today? by Lis
a Grimes.  In addition to the intrinsic reward gained by filling each 

drawings at our monthly Wildcat Pride Gatherings. Kindness and Anti
-
bullying instruction is given throughout the school 
year, including how to get immediate help if a student feels bullied or is worried about a classmate. In 2019
-
20, we are 
using Sanford Harmony curriculum to directly teach social
-
emotional concepts such 
as empathy and active listening.  
Walnut participates in Unity Day, Inclusive Schools Week, and Kindness Week.  We are recognized as a 2019 Kindness 
School.

ding the Assistance 
League of Conejo Valley, Art Trek, TO Arts, Arts Without Limits, CSVP Senior Volunteers, YMCA, Horace Mann, Delta Kappa 
Gamma, St. Julie Billiart's Catholic Church, and LightShine Community Church. These community members support 
Walnut
's students by providing classroom assistance, extra school supplies, donated books for students to take home, 
additional arts opportunities, and after
-
school homework assistance.  LightShine has also "adopted" families in need at 
the holidays and voluntee
red on weekends for campus beautification. A Walnut alumna donates annually to support our 
Create Club and dance programs. We always enjoy working with surrounding Newbury Park cluster schools, especially 
welcoming Walnut alumni back on campus.  Students f
rom Sequoia Middle School and Newbury Park High School regularly 
volunteer at school events and participate in after
-
school learning activities such as homework help and Coding Club.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Uni
fied School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board 
of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supple
mentary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analy
zing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achiev
e high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Educatio
n and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 
1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with
 
the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

Each fall, a team that consists of all or many of the following personnel, inspects each school in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District:  Site Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operatio
ns, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the Assistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanliness of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walk
ways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any observed condition that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and staff is 
annotated for immediate correction.  Notes include items that could improve the utility, appearance, sustaina
ble 

Major Projects List.  The projects included on the final Major Projects List are based upon a priority assessment of all 
identified Dis
trict schools' needs and the funds available to address those needs.  The Board of Education approves the 
final list in the spring, so the majority of the projects detailed are completed the following summer.  Funds available 
through participation in the S

annual Major Projects List each year.  The District revises and submits a Five
-
Year Deferred Maintenance Plan to the Office 
of Public School Construction and has had no r

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT
 
At Walnut, we are committed to providing multiple entry points for parents to be involved in the life of our school.  In fact
, 
one of the four goals in our School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is dedicated to in
creasing parent involvement.  
Parents are encouraged to volunteer in classrooms, in the library, on field trips, and at special events.  The Parent Teacher
 
Association (PTA), School Site Council (SSC) and English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) are active,
 
organized groups that 
meet regularly and invite parent participation. Our bilingual school outreach assistant is on campus daily to help families 
feel a part of the Walnut community.  She helps parents get involved on campus, organizes parent education cl
asses, and 
connects people with community resources as needed.  Walnut offers multiple parent education classes each year, 
including beginning and intermediate English classes as well as topical classes, such as Triple P Parenting, Internet Safety,
 
Ways to
 
Support Students' Reading Comprehension, a Social
-
Emotional Toolkit, and Understanding the Go Math Program. 
Classes are offered in both English and Spanish and parents from surrounding schools are invited to participate.
 
 
Walnut staff members and the PTA 
host multiple community
-
building opportunities throughout the year that welcome 
parent participation.  Families enjoy annual events such as Family Reading Night, Monster Mash, International Dinner, 
Science Night, the Fun Run, and the End
-
of
-
the
-
Year Bash. 
 
Many parents also make homemade crafts to donate to the 
Holiday Shop each December, the proceeds of which purchase food and clothing for needy families in the school 
community.  Parents are encouraged to attend presentations about Walnut's educational pro
grams, such as Back
-
to
-
School Night, Title I Informational Meetings, Open House, GATE Parent Meetings, and Parent
-
Teacher Conferences. All 
PTA, School Site Council, and English Language Advisory Council meetings are advertised in advance and opened to all 
parents.  Families keep up
-
to
-
date about events, classes, and school programs through the digital newsletter, "What's 
New at Walnut?" (offered in English and Spanish), the digital marquee, Facebook and Twitter posts, paper flyers, and the 
Blackboard system
 
which contacts parents by telephone and email.  We believe in open communication and all parents 
are welcome at Walnut!  For further information regarding parent involvement and volunteer opportunities, you are
