By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES
 
Juniper Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus
 
supervision. Original facilities were built in 1958; ongoing maintenance and 
modernization helps facilities remain up to
 
date and provide adequate space for students. Portable classrooms have been added throughout the years to
 
accommodate growth in enrollment.

CAMPUS MAINTENENANCE
 
The
 
custodial staff and district's maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained, safe, and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. The principal and custodians 
communicate daily or as ne
eded and for special assignments; hand
-
held two
-
way radios enhance communication efforts 
and help facilitate an immediate response to emergency situations.
 
 
One full
-
time day custodian, one full
-
time evening custodian and one 3 3/4 hour custodian are assig
ned to Juniper 
Elementary. Custodians follow a schedule and checklist system for completing daily, weekly, and monthly cleaning and 
maintenance projects. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other 
conditions that need attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. The evening custodians clean 
classrooms, administrative offices, desks, restrooms, and are responsible for set up and take down of equipment and/or 
furniture for afternoon 
and evening events.
 
 
Juniper Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance & Operations department (M&O) for larger projects, 
routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables Juniper 
Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Emergency situations 
are regularly resolved within appropriate time limits.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which pro
vides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and

s calculated by taking the total 
number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The 
number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, t
he number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level 
percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

At Juniper Elementary, the school and family form an important partnership to assist students in achieving their fullest 
potential and maturation into responsible citizens. Teachers and adminis
trators encourage parents to become active 
members of the Juniper Elementary learning community and help develop independent, self
-
reliant, and lifelong learners. 
Parents are invited to volunteer in the classroom, participate in school events, and join sch
ool committees. School Site 
Council, Parent Teacher Club, and English Language Advisory Council are a few of the many opportunities for parents to 
become involved in their child's educational experience. Parents who are interested in volunteering their tal

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around the State Standards and are 
research
-
based.
 
 
Through the use of data 
collection, evidence of student learning, as well as input from our Guiding Coalition and School 
Site Council, we have composed a Comprehensive Needs Assessment that has helped us identify areas of strengths and 
next steps. In working with InnovateEd, we h
ave developed a site focus that our students will comprehend and 
communicate at a DOK 3 or higher across all content areas. The following tier 1 instructional practices are in place school
-
wide to support our site focus: Number Talks, Write from the Beginn
ing and Beyond, Guided Reading, Interactive Read 
Alouds, and DOK questioning strategies.
 
 
Using Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) with an emphasis on the cycle of inquiry, grade levels teams are reflecting 
on the impact of their practices and lookin
g at evidence of student learning. This school year, we have added a site coach 
who is working directly with each grade level on our site focus. Our Guiding Coalition team works together with 
administration and the site coach to use Staff Meetings for focu
sed professional development in identified areas of need 
(i.e. DOK).  Teachers also have the opportunity to attend conferences to support best instructional practices that meet 
our site focus.  Our coach is willing to attend conferences along
-
side teachers
 
so that she can continue the coaching cycle 
by providing another lens through which each teacher can reflect upon his/her instruction and continue to have a positive 
impact on student achievement.
 
 
Per our site coaching plan, all teachers work with the co
ach both individually and with their grade level teams to dig deeper 
into how to implement strategic instruction at a higher DOK in all content areas.  She attends Days of Planning with each 
team three times per year, as well as PLC meetings weekly to supp
ort teams with data analysis, curriculum planning, and 
reflective feedback throughout the coaching cycle.  She regularly schedules individual meetings with teachers (per teacher 
request), as well, to discuss student data, instructional practices, and indiv
idual areas of support needed.
 
 
New teachers receive support and training through the district's Induction Program and New Teachers Academy. For 
beginning and out
-
of
-
state teachers, the district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Begin
ning 
Teacher Support and Assessment), a statewide and state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing support and skill 
building through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teache
r orientations each year to support year
-
round hiring practices; the orientation is a 
comprehensive overview of the district's policies, school law, English language learners support, curriculum, instruction, 
and grade
-
level and content area specialties. S
ite coaches also work alongside new teachers to provide support in the 
areas of our site focus, classroom management, instructional strategies and much more.
