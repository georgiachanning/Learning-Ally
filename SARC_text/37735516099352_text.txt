School Description
 
Kelly Elementary School is a transitional kindergarten through fifth grade school with a staff who strives to 
promote a healthy balance of 
social emotional well
-
being and  rigorous instruction in a safe, fun, and engaging 
classroom environment.  Aligned with our district graduate profile, our school vision statement is "Cougars 
C.R.E.A.T.E".  We work collaboratively to prepare our students to
 
be Curious Learners, Respectful Students, 
Empathetic Citizens, Ambitious Individuals, Take Initiative, Empowered Leaders.
 
 
Our teachers utilize grade level collaboration time to plan meaningful learning opportunities for our students.   
We provide differe
ntiated instruction with focus on enrichment, as well as, interventions.   Classroom 
teachers, with additional support from credentialed tutors, provide targeted intervention to meet the varied 
learning needs of our students.  We place a focus on teaching 
necessary foundational skills, while also 
implementing Design Thinking and Project Based Learning with the support of our Innovation Instructor.  
Students in grades 3
-
5 have 1:1 Chromebooks and grades Tk
-
2 have at least bi
-
weekly access to Chromebooks 
and 
additional technology.  Thanks to our PTA and the Carlsbad Education Foundation, our students receive 
instruction in music, art, inquiry based science, PE, and have many more educational opportunities in the form 
of grade level assemblies and field trips.
 
 
In addition to high academic rigor, kindness and leadership prevail at Kelly Elementary.   Our school was one 
of the founding schools of the Great Kindness Challenge and that culture of kindness and empathy is prevalent 
on campus every day.  Student leade
rship opportunities abound throughout campus and include leading 
student award assemblies, morning announcements,organizing our recycling program, and running many 
other school
-
wide activities.  Kelly Elementary is a community that is inclusive of all stud
ents, staff, and 
families.  We host an annual Compassion Day to teach empathy to our school community.  Our parents 
volunteer countless hours through PTA events and classroom activities.  We also receive support from the 
Carlsbad Education Foundation.  The
ir dedication and commitment to education is evident every day.  These 
parent, school, and community partnerships are what help make Kelly Elementary the sought after school that 
it is today.
 
 
Emma Cobb, PRINCIPAL
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the learning needs 
of the students in their class, teachers differentiate based on these learning needs and they collaborate with 
grade level team teachers as we
ll as the principal to ensure students progress at every level.  Beyond the 
general education classroom, schools have Learning Center support, and depending upon the site, Special Day 
Classrooms, Guide counseling, and School Counselors.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQues
t is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

One of the main components that set Kelly School apart from other schools 
is the sense of community and collaboration that is shared by staff, students, 
administration, and parents. All players focus on the academic and emotional success of every child. Parent volunteers assist
 
daily in the classrooms by 
leading discussion group
s on literature, reading with students, teaching math facts, and  helping teachers by preparing materials for classroom activ
ities 

dication and commitment 
to education is evident every day. Regularly, 20 to 25 parents and community members volunteer in our classrooms daily; they 
participate in the PTA, 
the room

School Night, Open House, Family Nights, and they 
attend various programs and productions. Parents participate on 
the School Site Council, district advisory councils, and district and site strategic planning committees. They also serve as

School Safety Plan
 
We revise and update our school safety plan each year in the fall. Our current school safety plan meets all federal, state, a
nd district standards for a 
comprehe
nsive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, responding, and recovering from possible threats (earthquakes, i
ntruders,  fires) to 
ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our counselors, psychologists, and site administrators are
 
extensively trained in threat assessment 
techniques by nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessment. To ensure safety on our campus, a school site safety committee conducts 
inspections to identify potential hazards. We have also developed a d
isaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire and earthquake drills to 
familiarize staff and students with emergency procedures. Our school site is also monitored for physical safety. Play structu

landscaping are ma
intained at a high standard for student safety and undergo regular inspections. A new visitor check
