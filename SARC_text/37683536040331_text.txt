By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Pasqual Union School reflects all that 

-
school district 
recently celebrated its 100
-
year anniversary, we are reminded to honor our rich past while embracing a future of limitless 
opportunity.   Born from a 2
-
room schoolhouse in the h

27
-
acre campus, San Pasqual Union School provides a quaint and inviting backdrop for inspired teaching and learning.  The 
modern facilities of San Pasqual Union include 29 classrooms with 
an art room, two science labs, an 18,000
-
book library, 

known as Trussell Hall, is a replica of our original schoolhouse and appropriately bear
s the name of one of our founding 
educators.  Additionally, the grounds of San Pasqual Union, including 18 acres of athletic fields, playgrounds, and gardens, 
are impeccably maintained to provide ample opportunities for outdoor learning and play.
 
 
San Pasq
ual Union maintains a rigorous academic program in which students consistently perform above state and county 
averages.  Teachers work collaboratively to prepare engaging lessons and utilize student data to drive instruction.  Core 
academic programs are en
hanced via elementary enrichment (which includes STEM and music programs) and middle 
school exploratory wheels (with each wheel offering courses in the arts, world languages, and technology).  Student 
experiences are enhanced through strong partnerships wi
th our families and community.  Volunteer groups such as the 
Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), SP School Foundation, Red Barn Arts, SAGE garden, School Site Council (SSC), and our 
District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC) volunteer time, raise 
much needed funds, and sponsor school 
events to enrich the learning experience for all children.  Further, our partnership with the San Diego Zoo Safari Park 
provides unique opportunities for applied learning and hands
-
on research as students are directly 
connected with the 
conservancy efforts of experts in the field.
 
 
Both students and staff are encouraged to S.O.A.R., demonstrating that they are Safe, On
-
task, Accepting, and 
Respectful/Responsible in words and deeds.  We build students of character throug
h the six core pillars of trustworthiness, 
respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.  These pillars promote our overarching mission to ensure all 
children receive an education that builds the character, confidence, knowledge, and skills t
o prepare them to be 
competent life
-
long learners who can achieve excellence.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
FIT: Overall rating: 100.00%, Exemplary
 
 
San Pasqual Union School is nearly 20
-
years
-
old.  As such, under the direction of the Governing Board, the Superintendent 
has made it a priority to fund deferred maintenance to offset the liability of anticipated and ongoing expenses.  Corrective 
and preve
ntative maintenance is prioritized to promote long
-
term savings.  As part of the plan, the District allocates funds 
for routine restricted maintenance, plus additional funds for deferred maintenance.  During the 2018
-
19 school year, the 
District spent $24,
470.53 on general repairs.  Major projects funded through deferred maintenance included painting 
($27,330), asphalt repair/striping ($21,763), roof repairs ($26,222), rain gutters ($1520), water leak repair ($26,941), and 
HVAC repair ($3496). The District 
maintains playground equipment, structures, blacktop, playgrounds, and grass fields as 
needed.  The District is proactive in compliance with all fire and safety requirements.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Pasqual Union School enjoys the active 
support of its parents and community members.  Volunteers are a vital part 
of the school community and are encouraged to actively participate in all aspects of our academic, athletic, and 
enrichment programs.  The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), Distric
t English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC), SP 
School Foundation, Red Barn Arts, Students Are Growing Everyday (SAGE) garden, Everyone a Reader (EAR), and the School 
Site Council (SSC) serve as essential educational partners.  Our parent partners raise t
he funds needed to sustain and grow 
vital programs.  In addition, these parent groups review and provide input to our school plans, including our Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), Comprehensive School Safety Plan, and the School Accountability Repo
rt Card (SARC).  As 
reflected in the 2019 Healthy Kids Parent Survey, 93% of parents feel that the school encourages parents to be active 
partners.  Additionally, 96% of parents feel that parents feel welcome at school events.
 
 
In 2019, San Pasqual Union S
chool updated our communications network, improving the District website 
(www.sanpasqualunion.net) and integrating it with a network of mass communications (email, phone, text, app, social 
media).  In addition to hosting a school app (San Pasqual Union Sch
ool, found in the App Store), the District created and 
maintains Instagram (@san_pasqual_saints), Twitter (@san_pasqual_union), and YouTube (San Pasqual Union School) 
social media accounts.  Further, the District makes daily use of the PeachJar flyer distr
ibution system (San Pasqual Union 
Elementary) to keep parents and the community informed of important announcements, school activities, and 
opportunities.  Information is also provided to the parents via an electronic school marquee.  Through all these met
hods, 
parents are encouraged to be active partners in school events and initiatives.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
San Pasqual Union School is a modern facility in a safe, clean environment conducive to learning. The 27
-
acre facility is 
completely fenced and locked.  There are 15 security cameras that monitor and record activities 24 hours per day, 7 days 
per week, 
at campus perimeter gates, main entrances, and other areas of campus. Certificated and classified staff 
supervise students before school, during recess/nutrition, lunch and after school.  The District proactively promotes the 
six pillars of character withi

which students are explicitly taught and encouraged to practice safe, on
-
task, accepting, and respectful behaviors.  The 
District has response protocols for situa
tions and/or students who are at
-
risk or in crisis.  Staff is trained in Trauma
-
Informed Practice for Schools (TIPS), Restorative Practices, and Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS).  A school 
psychologist is available to provide counseling and a
cademic support to students.
 
 
District safety plans and procedures are in place to ensure the safety of students, staff, and volunteers.  A District Safety
 
Committee, comprised of school staff and community members with law enforcement, public safety, mili
tary, and other 
relevant experience, meets at least twice annually to review potential threats and make recommendations to improve 
plans, policies, and procedures.  The District uses the process of assessment, planning, physical protection, and response 
ca
pacity designed to: 1) Protect students and staff from physical harm; 2) Minimize disruption and ensure the continuity 
of education for all children; 3) Develop and maintain a culture of safety; and 4) Inform the school community of safety 
plan and procedu
res.  San Pasqual Union assesses hazards, vulnerabilities, and resources; plans for risk reduction and 
disaster response; and creates preparedness plans for a variety of potential incidents.  The District holds drills to practic
e, 
reflect, and improve.  In

and SAGE Garden raise money each year to help offset the cost of programs, activities, field trips, assemblies, and 
other educational experiences.
