Description
 
 
ﬁThe
 
Joli
 
Ann
 
community
 
believes
 
all
 
students
 
will
 
excel
 
academically
 
through
 
perseverance,
 
critical
 
thinking,
 
problem
 
solving,
 
and
 
a
 
love
 
of
 
learning.
 
All
 
students
 
will
 
be
 
empowered
 
to
 
lead
 
with
 
empathy
 
as
 
contributing
 
members
 
of
 
their
 
world.ﬂ
 
Our
 
mission
 
reflects
 
our
 
beliefs
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
our
 
responsibility
 
to
 
teach
 
a
 
rigorous
 
and
 
relevant
 
curriculum
 
to
 
all
 
students,
 
while
 
instilling
 
in
 
students
 
habits
 
that
 
lead
 
to
 
a
 
successful
 
life.
  
Working
 
together
 
as
 
a
 
professional
 
learning
 
community,
 
we
 
provide
 
all
 
students
 
with
 
the
 
tools
 
necessary
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
intellectual,
 
social,
 
emotional
 
and
 
physical
 
challenges
 
of
 
the
 
twenty-first
 
century.
  
We
 
ensure
 
equitable
 
access
 
to
 
learning
 
so
 
that
 
all
 
children
 
reach
 
their
 
true
 
potential.
  
Additionally
 
we
 
strive
 
to
 
support
 
in
 
our
 
students
 
in
 
a
 
desire
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
work
 
hard,
 
to
 
think
 
creatively
 
and
 
critically,
 
and
 
to
 
believe
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
successful
 
in
 
their
 
future
 
years
 
of
 
schooling
 
in
 
their
 
chosen
 
careers.

About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

tool
 
located

enrollment,
 
high
 
school
 
graduates,
 
dropouts,
 
course
 
enrollments,
 
staffing,
 
and
 
data
 
regarding
 
English
 
learners).
