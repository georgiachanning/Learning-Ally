By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the 
preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.
   
A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school's needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, Measure D, and state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Aust
in Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. Village School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as recent replacement of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the oth
er five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, cabinetry, heating 
systems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker boards. Each multi
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media cent
ers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administrative wing of each school was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs, a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.
 
 
During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure
 
F and local reserves were utilized for modernization of the 
Matanzas campus.  Included were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled office complex, and 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction o
f several classrooms, including a 
shared music building.  In August 2017 the Madrone and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a music room.  A new play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made t
o the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Village opened up with a major renovation to the classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, and landscaping improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the sch
ools, with the other schools to be completed in the next two years.  All schools have now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will receive improvements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Boar
d has identified the following as key goals for the Measure F program. To ensure the 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable classrooms with modular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency com
ponents such as HVAC, lighting, and window systems.
 
 
Cleaning standards have been adopted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance and Operations 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cle
aning standards are being upheld. In 
addition, the principal communicates daily with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
proactive with maintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under t
his plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged and invited to participate in variety of ways at Village Elementary.  There is an active Parent's Club
 
which meets monthly, the purpose of which is to promote and enrich the welfare and educational experiences of the 
children at Vill
age Elementary, and to reinforce the home and reinforce the home and school connection. Parents are 
encourage to run for election to the School Site Council, which meets several times a year.  Parents on the council become 
informed, share information, disc
uss needs and successes, and plan school program improvements.  The council develops 
a comprehensive plan designed to improve the effectiveness of the school, and assists in making budgetary decisions of 
funds within its purview.  All parents are invited t
o attend the meetings. We have an English Language Advisory Committee 
(ELAC) member who represents our parents of children who are English Learners at our own Site Council meetings and 
also at the district level. Additionally, the parent club has a strong 
voice in the school and engages the outside community 

educational experiences of the children at Village Elementary, and to reinforce the home 
and school connection.
 
 
Village Elementary student body is diverse representing many different cultural, ethnic, religious and racial backgrounds.  
It is this diversity that makes Village school so rich. It also creates an added responsibility to provide l
earning materials 
and programs that are representative and inclusive of our families as well as provide opportunities for building a strong 
community both within and outside our school environment.  To that end, the Multicultural Education Committee was 
fo

in a meaningful way so that our students learn how to appreciate differences instead of fear them.  By teaching our 
students how to co
nnect with each other, we are creating an accepting, nurturing school environment, and also teaching 
life skills that will allow them to become culturally competent members of society.  The MEC launched a campaign to 
expand multi
-
cultural educational oppor
tunities at Village Elementary.
 
 
Working together, families and staff held a school wide festival to celebrate the diverse cultural backgrounds represented 
at our school, purchased new books and materials that are representative of a diverse student body a
nd created 
assemblies with speakers, dance, music and arts performers who connected to our students and inspired them to learn 
about other cultures.
 
 
Parents are also sought out to participate in the annual Village Art's Day where parents are able to volun
teer in a classroom 
to conduct an art lesson.  Parent's are instructed on how to teach the art lesson and they are given a time slot where they 
teach the lesson.  The entire day is devoted to many different types of art so that students can learn about art
 
in a fun and 
stimulating manner.
 
 
We encourage and welcome parents volunteers, in the classroom, on field trips, helping with intramural sports, science 

l honors all volunteers 
at a Volunteer Celebration in the spring.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff

Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP). With a focus on High Quality Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of annual inservice, 
monthly "Distri
ct Wednesday" workshops on topics of interest/need (8 total), approximately 20 district
-
sponsored after 
school trainings annually, and 2
-
3 planning days throughout the year. A critical component of our professional 
development plan is coaching and mentorin
g through our Consulting Teacher program.  In addition, professional 
development opportunities are offered through attendance at Sonoma County Office of Education classes and educational 
conferences. For 2017
-
18, our topics of focus are English Language De
velopment, Technology Skills, Common Core ELA 
and Math standards implementation, and an incremental roll out of the Next Generation Science Standards.

Austin Creek and Rincon Valley has been focused on improving our math scores for students in grades 3
-
6 as measured 
by the SBAC, and improving English language acquisition for our English learner students as determined by our re
-
designation
 
rates on the former CELDT and current ELPAC tests.
 
 
We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards these goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic growth for our English learners we use the Re
nLearn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting grade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC and the SBAC to review the effectiveness of 
o

math progress by reviewing Eureka Math end
-
of
-
module assessments, students in grades 1
-
6 also take MobyMax 
placement tests two times per y
ear, and students in grades 3
-
6 take the SBAC summative assessment 1 time per year.
 
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the LCAP. With a focus on High Quality 
Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with thr
ee full
-
days of professional development trainings, 2
-
3 grade level planning 
days yearly, 8 monthly "District Wednesday" professional development sessions, and approximately 20 district
-
sponsored 
after school trainings.   Teachers can also attend professio
nal development opportunities through Sonoma County Office 

 
 
Teachers are supported in meeting our LCAP goals with coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher Program, 
teacher
-
principal meetings,
 
and grade level PLC teams.  The support is focused analyzing student assessment data to plan 
curriculum and make instructional choices which support teacher and student growth.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the district administration and school site pr
incipals participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with the 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions of Teaching and Leadership.  The administ
ration team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in our classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this professional development to include two 
teach
ers from each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional 
development in the framework through CEL.
