School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Lakeland Elementary School is located at 11224 Bombardier Avenue in Norwalk, with 
approximately 330 students attending from Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade. We are 
a neighborhood school where most students either walk or are driven by parents
 
or family 
members. Our community includes single
-
family homes, condominiums, and apartment units. 
Students attending Lakeland Elementary matriculate to Lake Center Middle School and, once 
promoted from eighth grade, likely attend Santa Fe High School in t
he Whittier Union High School 
District.
 
 
We have a talented team of staff and pare
nt volunteers who work closely together to ensure that 
our children receive the best possible education. Thirteen classroom teachers, additional 
interventionists, many support staff members, two custodians, office staff, and principal, make up 
the team of 
individuals dedicated to increasing the academic achievement of every child.
 
 

a difference for our children. Every Wednesday, teachers come together for ad
ditional training and 
planning. The primary focus has been instructional delivery, literacy development, writing, and real
-
world math application. Recently with the adoption of the new Common Core State Standards, we 
have purchased additional materials for
 
our classrooms to support our literacy and math programs.  
Also, we are updating our library to reflect an increased emphasis on non
-
fiction.  Every student 
has access to in
-
class Chromebooks.  We are proud of the achievements we have made and the 
support
 
our community provides us.
 
 
Lakeland Elementary School was named a California Distinguished School for 2014 and a 2016 
California Gold Ribbon School.  Further, the California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE) has 
named Lakeland to their Honor Roll 
multiple times, including the 2018
-
2019 school year. The CBEE 
recognizes schools that have demonstrated consistent high student academic achievement and 
have made significant progress toward closing achievement gaps among all students. In addition, 
Lakelan
d was awarded the GOLD Implementation Award by the California PBIS Coalition, California 
PBIS Coalition for successful PBIS implementation at the GOLD level.   In addition to traditional 
academics, we also have various supplemental programs such as fine ar
ts, physical education, 
music, and technology classes.  Overall, 96% of parents surveyed are satisfied with their child's 
school.
 
 
We are proud of our accomplishments and in the fulfillment of our mission, "The mission of 
Lakeland Elementary School, as a v
ital child
-
centered community resource, is to provide a solid 
academic foundation of partnership with the community in order to develop responsible, literate, 
well
-
balanced citizens who have the skills to succeed and a positive attitude toward lifelong 
lea
rning."

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lakeland Elementary School first opened its doors in 1950. Although most buildings are original, additions were constructed i
n 1
997 and 2000. Its design 
is like no other in the district. Most of the classrooms enjoy beautiful windows from floor to ceiling, allowing students the
 
opportunity to learn in a unique 
setting. Lakeland has 16 regular classrooms, seven portable classrooms, 
a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration building.  In 2013
-
2014 
school year Lakeland upgraded its outdoor lighting systems as well as installed wireless internet access throughout the campu
s.  Office windows were 
also replaced.
 
 
The school is
 
in good condition and is maintained by a staff of two diligent custodians. Work orders are placed to address safety, structur
al, and electrical 
issues. District personnel follow up on the work orders as necessary. We encourage every child to maintain a cl
ean campus by assuming responsibility 
for their actions and working together.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is
 
an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and vent
ilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in g
ood repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought abo
ut by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six

page Facilities Inspection 
Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parents and the community are encouraged to support the educational program at Lakeland Elementary School. Parent education c
lasses/speakers are 
offered to our community.  Gifted and Tal
ented Education (GATE) meetings/newsletters keep parents abreast of issues as they relate to our GATE 
population. Classroom volunteers are encouraged and supported at Lakeland Elementary. Parents are informed about the school p
rogram through the 


onthly newsletters,  
phone messages, and marquee notices. Moreover, parents may participate in site meetings such as School Site Co
uncil, English Language Advisory 
Committee, or Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  In addition, we hosted a family STEM day, funded by LCAP 28,  where parents 
participated in STEM 
activities with their children.   It is our goal to work collaboratively to f

welcomed at Lakeland when they walk into our main office.  96% of respondents surveyed agree that they feel welcomed by staff
 
when they visit and 
94% of these respondents are awa
re of the opportunities for involvement, participation, and decision making.
 
 
Our PTA offers many parent volunteer opportunities helping with regularly scheduled activities, which promote educational dis
tinction and build 
community and social awareness. Wi
th the help of our PTA and funds from LCAP 28, we held several events including, Spooky Story Night, Winter 
Wonderland, Parents and Pastries, and Family Game Night. Numerous programs and activities are enriched by the generous contri
butions made by 
communi
ty organizations such as  Lifetouch Pictures, The Habit,  Santa Fe Springs Library, Norwalk City Library, and others.

approved volunteers are permitted on school grounds during school hours.  We lock our campus at 8:25 a.m. During the day
, teachers report problems 
to the principal if necessary.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. It includes procedures for 
emergencies and locations of exit routes. It is available in the office for public review 
and comment as needed. We share the plan with all staff during a school
-
wide staff meeting. We conduct regular emergency, fire, and earthquake drills, 
reflect on the 
drills and make changes as needed. Each staff member has assigned duties that are reviewed yearly. Emergency materials are in
ventoried 
and maintained in a secure location in case a need arises. In addition, we have periodic assemblies that focus on respons
ibility and safety while on 
campus. It is our goal to ensure our students are safe both physically and mentally.
 
 
We have a counselor assigned to Lakeland to assist students that may have further needs, or students may attend sessions with
 
a Turning Point 
counseling 
provider.  98% of parents who were surveyed indicate Lakeland provides a safe environment for students.
 
 
Furthermore, Lakeland is in year 4 training and is in the process of implementing a school
-
wide PBIS framework, because the model approaches
 
behaviors 
as skills that need to be developed. It approaches behavior as an instructional need and explicitly taught.  The PBIS framewo
rk will create an effective 
and safe learning environment that improves teaching and learning at Lakeland.

Lakeland teachers participate in a wide variety of professional development activities at both the site and district level. D
uring the 2018
-
2019 school 
year, all Lakeland teachers participated in three district
-
wide professional developmental days, which w
ere focused on NGSS.   Each Friday, during Data 
Reflection Sessions teachers, meet to discuss data, student progress, and methods and strategies to assist them.  In addition
, teachers have been provided 
professional development in many areas such as teachi
ng to an objective, checking for student understanding, active student participation/engagement, 
effective interventions, Close Reading, literacy development and new California Common Core State Standards.  The Little Lake
 
City School District also 
provide
s teachers with many opportunities for professional development.  In addition, we regularly look for more opportunities to gr
ow as professionals.  
Members of our staff have attended Common Core conferences, attended New Generation Science Standards Confere
nces, are district leaders in regards 
to curriculum planning and assessment, and provide professional development to other educators in literacy and math instructi
on. Lakeland has several 
committees on staff focused on student achievement.  Our Student Ach
ievement Leadership Team participates in continuous data analysis, planning and 
leading professional development for our staff.  focused on finding ways to increase student achievement. This year we have f
ocused on vertical 
articulation in the area of math
ematics and English Language Arts. LCAP 7 funds are used to provide teachers with pull out days for planning and vertical 
articulation.  In addition this year, LCAP 7 funds will be used to send our Resource Specialist to The CARS Plus 2020 convent
ion focus
ed on professional 
development for educators that service children with exceptional needs. Together with our district math and ELA coaches, our 
teachers worked to 
develop lessons to best meet the needs of our students. Teachers meet twice a month during Da
ta Reflection Sessions to discuss student progress and 
plan for upcoming lessons. In the spring of 2020,  all teachers will receive professional development on Integrated ELD.   Ma
ny of our teachers are master 
teachers for aspiring educators attending vari
ous colleges in the California State University system and guide them regarding the best instructional 
practices and teacher preparedness.  Through our concerted efforts, we continually strive to provide the best educational exp
erience for our students 
and
 
to grow as professionals.

primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
