As you read this School Accountability Report Card (SARC) for the 2018
-
19 school year, I 
believe 
you will find what emerges is a picture of a school staff that believes its purpose is to meet the 

continue our tradition of excellence. Red Bank Elem
entary School is a four
-
time recipient of the 
California Distinguished School Award and previous recipient of the California Gold Ribbon School 
Award. In addition, we have been acknowledged in the past as a National Blue Ribbon School, and 
we have been rec


Red Bank has been honored with the California State University, Fresno Bo
nner Virtues and 
Character Recognition Award for five years. We also currently received the CLASSI (Clovis 
Assessment System for Sustained Improvement) award and the California Civic Learning Award for 
the 2018
-
19 school year. Our students have had great s
uccess in academics. Our athletic programs 
consistently rank at the top end in each of the 10 team sports offered. The band and choral music 
programs have consistently been top rated based on our Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) 
accountability model. 
Our drama and arts programs are second to none in CUSD. We had a 97 
percent student
-
participation rate in co
-
curricular activities. We continue to promote and develop 
a school culture where there is dignity and respect for all students. In 2018
-
2019 we imp
lemented 
our RISE (Respect, Integrity, Safety, and Excellence) Up system, our Positive Behavioral Intervention 
and Supports (PBIS) model. 
 
 
According to the most recent School Assessment ReviewTeam
 
(SART) survey, 97 percent of the 
parents strongly agree or agree that Red Bank promotes academic success for their child. The 
mission of the Red Bank staff is to work together to meet the needs of every student by developing 
self
-
sufficient problem solver
s who strive to be exemplary in mind, body and spirit. One of our goals 
is to reduce the academic gap of our English
-
learner, low
-
income and foster
-
youth students by 
providing effective classroom instruction, intervention, support, and communication with p
arents 
and guardians. Our goal is for our students to achieve state, local and district priorities as we remain 
aligned to our district aims.

School Vision Statement 
 
 
We envision a learning community in which: 
 

 
Students are active participants in the learning process.
 

 
Students and staff are committed to analyzing and monitori
ng data in a collaborative culture.
 

 
Staff members are committed to the safety, self
-
esteem, academic success and general well
-
being of every student. Family 
and community members take pride and ownership in the school and its mission.
 
About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Red Bank Elementary School opened in 1981. We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our custodial staff ensures the 22 
classrooms,  6 portables, 
music room, computer lab, the Library Media Center
 
(LMC), multipurpose room (MPR) and office are kept in top condition. In addition, we conduct deep 
cleaning two times a year. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus 
grounds and re
strooms on a regular basis to provide feedback to our student body. When asked to grade how well the buildings and grounds ar
e 

d. G
raffiti, if any discovered, 
is removed immediately. Through increased community awareness, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low.
 
 
Red Bank Elementary has 22 regular class rooms, a music room, library, c
omputer lab, and multipurpose room. The design capacity of the school is 616 
students, with a district enrollment capacity at 780. During the 2018
-
19 school year, there were 7 portables used to meet the needs of our student 
enrollment. Athletic facilities 
include three baseball fields, a football field, track, eight basketball courts and four volleyball courts.
 
 
Parking along the west side of Locan Avenue and a north parking area has provided needed space for parents and staff. Work wi
th the city of Clovis 
has 
provided additional safety features for crossing busy streets before and after school. Crossing guards are solicited to assis
t students as they cross streets 
safely. Modifications to the play areas have made the structures compliant to state guidelines
. The student council and Principal's Advisory Student 
Association (PASA) meet regularly to discuss strategies to provide a forum for student voice, to promote school safety and to
 
get students involved in 
campus beautification. The care of our facilities 
is a joint effort. As part of the CLASSI review during 2018
-

cleanliness.
 
 
The district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on building and main
taining ex
cellent facilities as 
economically as possible.
 
 
Construction took place in 2015 to modernize Red Bank. Among the many improvements were a new HVAC system, additional technol
ogy to the 
multipurpose room and classrooms, a remodeled administration office, an
d the addition of a reading area to the library.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

Parent involvement at Red Bank is very strong. We encourage parents to partici pate in events, committee work, support clubs 
and perform volunteer 
work. These organizations are advertised through newsletter articles, classroom
 
teacher contact, website information and through peer communication 
with the Parent Teacher Club (PTC), School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), Intercultural Diver
sity Advisory Committee 
(IDAC), and other community organizati
ons.
 
 
Since 1973, CUSD has benefited from the formation of a strong parent advisory group known as School Assessment ReviewTeam (SA
RT). The 
SARTcommittee meets quarterly and provides a forum for school personnel and interested parents to meet and discuss i
tems related to the effectiveness

School Safety Plan
 
Red Bank has a school safety plan and School Crisis Intervention Plan on file and a
vailable to all parents as well as the general public. Both plans are 
developed by the staff and reviewed with the school SART committee. The staff and students participate in a monthly safety dr
ill to reinforce appropriate 
responses to emergency situation
s (lockdown, emergency exit, fire, and duck and cover). In addition, the CUSD Emergency Procedures guideline provides 
common direction for lockdown, evacuation, facility alert, and rolling
-
blackout and power
-
outage situations. The administrative procedure 
protocols are 
used to guide these plans. The staff met at the beginning of the year to review, update and discuss the plan as a staff. When
 
deemed appropriate, 
adjustments are made throughout the year. The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and 
discussed with the school faculty in August 2019.

Professional development is ongoing to ensure the Red Bank staff keeps abreast of new
 
learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques and applied 
technology in the field of education. This past year, we have held monthly 
staff
-
development sessions during our 90
-
minute early release schedule. To 
ensure our staff remains current in the field of education, the utilization of conferences, workshops and in
-
services are stressed. Ongoing rollout sessions 
update staff on current 
changes in all academic areas. Monthly meetings with the site administration and weekly grade
-
level Professional Learning 
Community (PLC) meetings/cross grade
 
level staff members are used to discuss ongoing concerns and strategies to increase student acade
mic 
achievement. The school has formed a PLC Leadership team, and all grade levels participate in articulated efforts that focus 
on mastery learning of state 
standards. Walk
-
through visitations are used to reflect instructional practices as we implement th
e Common Core State Standards.
 
 
Many staff members have continued their education by receiving advanced degrees. Every general education teacher on the Red B
ank campus is fully 
credentialed, and every teacher is Cross
-
cultural Language and Academic Develop
ment (CLAD) certified or specially designed academic instruction in 
English (SDAIE) trained. In addition to the PLC work with grade
-
level teams, teachers receive administrative mentoring, peer coaching, walk
-
through 
feedback and one

on
-
one work with admini
stration to increase their effectiveness in the classroom.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mast
ery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the Ca
lifornia Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities 
on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school 
year.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing prof
essional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies,
 
Visible Learning, multi

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additiona
l assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activit
ies are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challen
ge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
