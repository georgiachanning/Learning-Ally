By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our School Facility was inspected by NCSIG in 
September 2017 and upgrades/repairs were completed in timely manner.   
Data from the September 2017 inspection is provided as the most recently completed report available.
 
 
The latest FIT Evaluation was done on October 21, 2019 by John McDonald and Kelly B
ear.
 
 
Hornbrook Elementary provides a well
-
maintained and safe school facility. The maintenance staff conducts daily,monthly 
and quarterly inspections of the school facilities to correct items that do not meet standards. The maintenance/custodial 
staff rou
tinely cleans and services each classroom and all adjacent offices and buildings on a daily basis. The school 
grounds, classrooms, and restrooms are exceptionally clean with all items in good working order.
 
 
Administration and the school board have develop
ed a master plan with architects.   The plan was developed to address 
deferred maintenance issues and modernization of the school site. The plan prioritizes needs based with safety first, 
followed by classroom / instruction, and the rest of the needs on si
te as lower priorities.  During the summer of 2019, we 
completed resurfacing playground blacktop and parking lot; installed new playground equipment and painted the 
classroom wing of the main building and the gym on east and west sides; window springs were
 
replaced on all north facing 
windows in main building.  The school is approximately 71 years old. A gymnasium was added approximately 36 years ago 
as well as three additional classrooms. There are six regular classrooms, a library, gymnasium, cafeteria an
d an office. 
There are two athletic fields and a well equipped playground that meets safety standards. There is a master plan 
developed with a landscape architect to improve outdoor facilities systematically.  The library is stocked with books on 
loan from
 

computers with internet access.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Comprehensive Safety Plan was reviewed by the school site council 12/2/2019 and school board in February 
2020.
 
The School Comprehensive Safety Plan was discussed with the school faculty in August 2019 and January 2020.
 
 
It is of supre
me importance to Hornbrook Elementary School to provide a safe, secure & harmonious environment for all 
who attend or visit our facilities. Annually, the Hornbrook Elementary School staff has in
-
service on the components of 
the School Safety Plan; namely, 
emergency response map, emergency drills, universal health precautions, analysis of 
student discipline data and discipline procedures. All staff are trained in ALICE active shooter/violent critical incident 
procedures. All Certificated staff and classified
 
staff are trained in CPR, AED and First Aid. We have one AED on campus. 
Quarterly safety meetings and inspections of the site are held to evaluate current conditions and address safety needs. 
Our campus is secured with a perimeter fence with locked gates 
and the buildings have locked doors where one must be 
buzzed in to gain access.  Hornbrook Elementary is very conscientious in promoting a safe school.

Hornbrook Elementary School believes very strongly in the professional development of its entire staff. Our school is in 
year three (19/20) of implementing PBIS. All teachers and 
paraprofessionals attended the PBIS training in 2017; three 
certificated did a refresher class in 2018; and three certificated did Tier 2 training in fall of 2019. Professional developm
ent 
is an ongoing process evidenced by the current practice of research
 
based staff meetings, collaboration, and teacher 
activities. All four teachers have been and are participating in county
-
wide professional development offerings to 
collaborate with peers regarding Common Core Standards and implementation. For 2017
-
18, 9 d
ays were dedicated to 
ELA and/or math professional development. For 2018
-
2019 and 2019
-
2020, professional development for the teachers' is 
based on individual need. Our paraprofessionals participate in a county
-
wide training held twice each year for 17/18 
and 
18/19. In 2019/20 they each participated in three training days. In 2017/18, full
-
day equaled 20 days and 6 were partial 
days. In 2018/19, full
-
day equaled 12 and 9 were partial days. In 2019/20, it is estimated that we will have completed 17 
full
-
day 
professional development and 9 were partial days.
 
 
The primary focus of professional development includes: 
 

 
Common Core Standards in ELA and Math
 

 
Next Generation Science Standards
 

 
Visual and Performing Arts
 

 
Smarter Balanced Assessments
 

 
Implementing Technology in the Classroom
 

 
Behavioral support
