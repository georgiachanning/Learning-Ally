By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parkview School is a multi
-
ethnic school located on the east s
ide of Chico, on East 8th street adjacent to Bidwell Park.  It 
is one of 12 elementary schools in the CUSD.  Parkview places an emphasis on  Science Technology Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) instruction, curriculum and learning.  Nationally, STEM
-
based
 
curricula are proliferating throughout 
high schools and elementary schools, as they offer an approach to teaching and lifelong learning that emphasizes the 
natural interconnections of the four separate STEM disciplines.  By better focusing on these core d
isciplines, students are 
better prepared for high school and college.  Parkview uses STEM  to emphasize collaboration, problem
-
 
solving and critical 
thinking.
 
 
In addition to a school
-
wide commitment to STEM, Parkview also houses Chico's Gifted and Talen
ted Education (GATE) 
classes for 4th and 5th grades.The program has been tremendously successful in providing a valuable learning platform 
and consistent class environment for those students ready and able to learn at an accelerated pace.
 
 
Parkview recei
ves supplemental state and federal funding which includes: Title I, Title II, LCFF targeted dollars, and the 
free and reduced lunch program. In addition to these services, we join with the Chico Area Volunteers in Education (CAVE) 
program.  Many staff memb
ers host student teachers which also provide extra support in the classrooms.
 
 
The Parkview School community provides a quality academic and social emotional education that promotes personal 
success. This is accomplished through standards
-
based instructi
on, on
-
going assessment, and high academic and 
behavioral expectations in a safe, engaging, language
-
rich environment.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Educa
tion. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comp
rised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to 
review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the 
adoption cycle. The
se standards aligned textbooks are in the hands of all students within two years of adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes 
great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. The original buildings at Parkview 
were constructed in 1953. Permanent buildings were added in 1965 and 1967. Portables were added in 1986, 1988, 1995, 
1997 and 2000. Parkview curren
tly has 19 regular classrooms, 5 portable classrooms, a Library, Multipurpose 
Room/Cafeteria and preschool. All buildings were painted on the outside in the summer of 2016.  During 1993, the original 
buildings underwent reconstruction funded by the State. 
This project included the removal of asbestos, the addition of 
new heating/air conditioning systems, renovation of flooring, wall covering, lowered ceilings and new cabinetry. The 
multipurpose room, office and classrooms were included in the project. The t
otal square footage is 44,402.79 on 7.48 
acres. The school's practical student capacity is 551 students. New playground equipment was provided by PTO funds and 
a new field and sprinklers were installed in 1999. District maintenance staff ensures that the r
epairs necessary to keep the 
school in good repair and working order are completed. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The day and nighttime custodians keep the school clean a
nd in good 
repair. The day custodian arrives before day break to have the campus ready for the opening of the school day. The 
playground is checked and cleared of any litter/debris that may have accumulated overnight. Graffiti is dealt with 
immediately whe
n discovered. All staff and students work together to do a good job keeping litter picked up and the 
school grounds tidy. In addition, the district sends a grounds crew on a weekly basis and a maintenance team on an "as 
needed" basis. Any safety issue is d
ealt with immediately. Parkview students, staff and parents take pride in maintaining 
the appearance of our beautiful school. Children are encouraged to pick up after themselves and many children ask to 
pick up trash regularly so they can be of help to the
 
adults.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
