About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to pub
lish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepar
e a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consisten
t with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information a
bout the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents play important roles at First Street School through their active participation and involvement in School Site Council
 
(SSC), English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), "CHAMPS" Parent Teachers Club (PTC), annu
al events and regular volunteering in the classrooms.  First Street School is becoming a 
focal point and community center for students and their parents.  We have begun a more extensive process for reviewing school
 
information with staff, 
district, and com
munity stakeholders. At the end of the 18
-
19 school year, we put out a detailed budget review of our funding streams and expenses. 
That review also included a look ahead to some initial ideas and plans for the 19
-
20 school year. In addition, a parent surve
y was conducted to get some 
feedback on how the community felt we were doing and where they would like to see some improvements and changes.  We communic
ate extensively 
through our "Roadrunner Weekly" newsletter, school App notifications, School Messenger 
calls and emails, our Facebook page, and Peach Jar flyers.

site.
 
 
A safety plan was also developed for First Street School.  A committee composed of administration, certificated and classifie
d personnel, parents, and 
law enforcement reviews the plan annually and revises it as deemed necessary.
