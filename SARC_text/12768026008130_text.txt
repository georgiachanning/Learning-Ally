Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Ambrosini School meets and exceeds Field Act requirements, and state and federal handicapped access requirements, 
and is inspected on a regular basis for a wide 
variety of health and safety items by qualified District and non
-
District 
employees including, but not limited to, the state Fire Marshall, insurance, JPA Loss Control and Safety Analyst, Humboldt 
County Health department and outside private vendors. The D
istrict employs a full
-
time maintenance worker who works 
at all four sites. Ambrosini School has a full
-
time custodian and two part
-
time custodians who establish and maintain high
-
quality cleanliness and the availability of necessary supplies. The safety a
nd comfort of our students and staff is our highest 
maintenance priority.
 
 
Ambrosini was built in 1959. The school has 15 general education classrooms, 1 mild to moderate special day classroom, 
a library, a multipurpose room, a computer lab, and a special 
education classroom. Athletic facilities include a separate 
playground for kindergarten, a first through fourth grade playground, and a playing field.
 
 
Students are kept safe on campus due to a schedule of staff supervision that places staff members in key
 
locations during 
recess, passing periods, before school, and after school. The school grounds are fully covered by a video surveillance 
system and an integrated fire alarm system. Our school maintains a Comprehensive School Safety Plan and an Emergency 
Ma
nagement Response Plan.
 
 
Norman G. Ambrosini Elementary School has a custodial staff of one full
-
time staff member working from 7:00 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m., two part
-
time custodians who work from 4:00 to 8:00 p.m., plus a maintenance supervisor with district 
re
sponsibilities who works from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
 
 
The District employs a gardener to maintain the lawns and grounds. Deferred Maintenance Program and safety funds are 
allocated to keep our site fully operational, functional and safe. Ambrosini School's cl
assroom interiors were completely 
modernized in 2003. Most recently, the old multipurpose room was remodeled into two new classrooms.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety, health and well
-
being are essential to enabling learning. Safety training in the classroom, on the 
playground, 
and to and from classrooms is practiced and monitored. Regular safety drills are taught and practiced. Each 
classroom has a safety backpack and emergency binder near its exit. The staff has been trained for disaster response. 
Most have had current first ai
d and CPR training. The District safety committee meets regularly and is responsible for 
updating the school plan and School Crisis Response Kit each year and for coordinating safety training.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was most recently reviewed, updated and
 
discussed with school faculty in September 2019. The 
key elements in the Ambrosini School Safety Plan include procedures, responsibilities, and student and staff training.
 
 
Participation in the Regional Emergency Management grant has broadened our safety 
plans to include regional aspects of 
emergency response.
