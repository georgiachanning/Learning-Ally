Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports:
 
Taft has implemented Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS), a school
-
wide discipline program that utilizes proactive 
strategies
 
for defining teaching and supporting appropriate student behaviors. At Taft, PBIS encompasses an integrated approach that 
focuses on prevention, instruction, and intervention by way of Taft's PBIS coaches, its PBIS team and staff members. A positi
ve schoo
l 
climate and support for all students is implemented in both classroom and non

classroom areas utilizing "Tiger Tickets", students of the 
week, and other positive reinforcements which are a daily part of life at Taft Elementary School.
 
 
Taft and Target's 
(TnT) Fit to Read Lab:
 
In January of 2012, Taft Elementary School was the recipient of a $100,000 unrestricted grant from Target and the Ellen DeGen
eres Show. 
The funds have been used to create a one

a
-

-
qua
lity recumbent bicycles coupled with 
student reading activities. The purpose of the lab is to measure and take advantage of the effects of exercise and reading.
 
 
In October 2014, Taft opened up a completely remodeled state of the art library and digital le
arning center courtesy of 'Heart of America' 
along with volunteers from Target.
 
 
Fun Fitness Fridays:
 
 
As a support to both Taft's PBIS program and physical fitness goals, Taft has implemented Fun Fitness Fridays. This is a scho

wide, 
physical 
education activity which focuses on 8 different centers of enriched physical activity where students are constantly engaged.

ent leaders 
from our 5th

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan

or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and 
with the
 
principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian, principa
l, and assistant principal inspect facilities for safety hazards, 
graffiti, and other conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cl

re in keeping facilities 
well stocked, safe, and sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classr

Groundskeepers are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields,
 
and irrigation systems.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or 
programs of study
