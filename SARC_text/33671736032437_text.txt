School Description
 
Katherine Finchy Elementary School is an educational environment where individual differences 
and the rights of other are respected. We believe that every child will succeed with the help of 
his/her parents and teachers to his/her maximum potential in a sa
fe and orderly academic 
environment.
 
 
Katherine Finchy Elementary school is named after Miss Katherine Finchy, a highly respected 
teacher, principal, and superintendent who came to Palm Springs Unified School District in 1921. 
The original school was dedic
ated in 1951 with the new building being dedicated in 1998. The 
school currently serves 620 transitional kindergarten through fifth grade students.
 
 
Katherine Finchy School has a heritage of strong commitment to student learning. Many students 
attend Kathe
rine Finchy School on intra
-
district transfers under the school of choice guidelines. 
Katherine Finchy School scored above district and county averages on the SBAC in all grade levels 
for ELA and Math. Katherine Finchy has been named as a recipient of the 
California Title I Academic 
Achievement Award for both the 2009
-
2010, 2010
-
2011 and 2015
-
2016 school years. To meet the 
criteria for this distinction, the school had to demonstrate that all students are making significant 
progress towards proficiency on Ca
lifornia's content standards.  Katherine Finchy was awarded with 
the California Gold Ribbon Schools distinction.
 
 
The California Department of Education provides the common core state standards that are taught 
in each subject area and at each grade level. 
Student academic growth and school achievement are 
monitored with formative ELA and Math district assessments and a summative state assessment.  
Palm Springs Unified School District chooses state adopted textbooks and provides staff 
development so that stu
dents have access to standard
-
based materials and research based 
strategies. The School Site Council writes and revises its school plan in accordance with state and 
federal regulations.
 
 
Katherine Finchy School staff leadership team evaluates the effective
ness of the school plan 
throughout the year. The School Plan for Student Achievement is updated annually by the 
Katherine Finchy School Site Council.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountabil
ity Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Acc
ountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in t
he SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
distric
t office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and community members have the opportunity to volunteer in the classrooms and parents may help chaperone field trips.
 
The PTA provides 
many activities and educational opportunities that enrich students' school
 
experience. Many activities also raise funds for classroom materials, field trips, 
and school
-
wide improvements.  The Meet the Masters art program is purchased and taught by PTA members. Sound systems, school signs, stu
dent 
ipads and other instructional m
aterial have been purchased by the PTA.  Many community businesses donate items for activities such as The Annual 
Spaghetti Family Dinner Night. In addition members of the community come to the event to participate in the evenings festivit
ies.
 
 
Back to Sch
ool Night, and the other Family Nights held throughout the school year provide information for parents from the teachers on h
ow they can 
help their child at home. Family Nights are paid for through our Title I parent participation money.  Participation for
 
parent trainings, informational 
meetings, and the support of time for special school activities is very high.
 
 
The School Site Council is an opportunity for parents to get involved in the decision making of the school. The feedback that
 
the staff receives
 
from the 
parents guides the parent education provided at the school along with the input from the parent groups and School Site Counci
l. The English Learner 
Advisory Committee meets regularly and makes suggestions for improving the learning experience for
 
English Learners.  Parent Involvement activities 
are posted on the school website.
 
 
The volunteer forms are available in the Parent/Student Handbook distributed at the beginning of the year and/or in the offic
e.
 
 
The Katherine Finchy School Teacher, Paren
t, Student Compact is signed each year and kept on file at the school. This reminds each party that they are 
part of a team, working together for the benefit of the student's success. At Katherine Finchy School, we provide accessibili
ty and opportunities f
or 
parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory students to participate in our 
school and the development of 
parent engagement policy by encouraging them to be participate in all activities. Translators are 
provided for parent meetings and school activities for 
the Spanish speaking parents. All parents are invited to all activities and are given accommodations that are requested.

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years. The professional developme
nt in these areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the 

ceptual understanding. 
The training will take place over 
the course of three years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was on developing strategies to support number sense by 
implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning in mathematics. During Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strength
ening mental 
math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implementing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This 
professional development also supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math
 
program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number 
Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 12 days of ELA training in 2017
-
18. For both 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 there are 6 days per year of training for ELA. 
The remaining number of days in 2018
