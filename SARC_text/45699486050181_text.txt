Our Vision
 
Columbia School District schools are safe, well maintained, engaging, stimulating and success 
oriented. The level of pride and accomplishment is quite 
evident. Staff have a high sense of 
responsibility, great values, positive behavior, and moral conscience. They hold themselves 
accountable for their actions and the choices they make. Adults are visible and accessible to 
students. Communication is open, f
riendly, and caring. Students come prepared, eager to 
participate, and devoted to learning because they believe in themselves. Parents take an active role 

col
laboratively working with the school staff.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The mission of our school district is to ensure learning for all children 

 
no limits, no excuses.
 
 
School Profile
 
Columbia Elementary School is a Transitional Kindergarten through fourth 
grade school located on 
the east side of Redding, California. Columbia School prides itself on providing a rich learning 
environment through direct teacher/ student instruction and strong supportive services. Our 
teachers maintain high professional standar
ds and are always on the cutting edge of new learning 
models and methods. Our test scores are on the rise and we are continuing to strive for 
improvement each year by implementing a consistent and articulated curriculum from preschool 
through 4th grade wit
h transitions to our 5
-
8 middle school. We operate an outstanding private 
preschool that coordinates a seamless transition into our Transitional Kindergarten & Kindergarten 
classes.  At Columbia, we work hard to provide a safe and positive learning environ
ment for our 
students. We have an active parent group that contributes in a myriad of ways to the success of 
our students. The community at large is encouraged to participate in all school activities. 
Attendance at our school plays and special events is ov
erwhelming. Our Parent Activities 
Committee supports projects throughout the school and allows students to participate in 
extracurricular activities not funded by the school. Columbia strives to maintain class size at 24:1 in 
grades TK
-
3 as a result of the
 
Local Control Formula Funding (LCFF) and bargaining agreement. We 
attempt to keep classes in 4th grade at 28:1. Our students are exceptionally well behaved and are 
taught safety, respect, and responsibility as a part of everything they do. We believe in p
ositive 
relationships and communication, award our children with PAWS Awards for being safe, 
responsible, respectful, as well as doing their best, being cooperative, and always thinking. Music 
education at Columbia is a valuable resource for students and f
amilies that are interested in their 
child learning an instrument at school. Classroom music instruction begins at Columbia in the 1st 
grade with singing, movement and rhythm activities. Students in the 4th grade learn to read music 
and play orff instrumen
ts and the recorder in class. TK 
-
 
4th grade students perform at least one 
visual and performing arts event per year and many do two.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Columbia Elementa
ry School District held a public hearing on September 11, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had suffi
cient and 
good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the
 
State of California. All students, 
including English Language Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks are adopted accor
ding to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available with the exception of 4th grade who did not adopt this year. Material
s approved for use by the 
State are reviewed by all
 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the District Office prior to adoption. This
 
table displays inform
ation 
about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Columbia Elementary School was built in 1955 and opened in 1956. While it is an older facility, it is well maintained by a st
aff of maintenance and custodial 
personnel who take pride in their work and their school. W
e have safety committees at both the site and the district that oversee safety issues. We have 
large fields and blacktop areas that are constantly being improved every year with landscaping, walkways, shade structures, a
nd playground equipment. 
Our site ha
s a large library and cafeteria/multi
-
purpose room. Picnic tables located on cement pads near the classrooms double as break time seating 
and study areas. The campus is continually being upgraded, modernized, and beautified.
 
 
In 2004, the School Office was
 
relocated to the front of the campus through modernization. This added to the safety of the entire campus as all visitors 
and the parking lot are easily monitored. The location in which the office was originally housed was modernized into a new cl
assroom 
that meets all ADA 
standards; additionally the 3 Pre
-
School rooms were brought up to requirements and standards; all air and heating units were upgraded through 
modernization.

which experts or speakers to bring in, (i.e. Prentice 
Hall Representatives, CSU Chico Professors), or experts to help us with our continuous improvement. 
District committees for Math and Reading/Language Arts also meet twice annually to review data and curriculum.
 
 
Staff development is delivered through our t
hree Consortium/District Wide SIP days. On SIP days, teachers may attend conferences if appropriate. 
Monthly staff development occurs in meetings with the Principal and grade level department teams. Professional Learning Commu

ata interpretation. 
Teacher support may be given through grade level articulation days, minimum day meetings, team and peer meeting
