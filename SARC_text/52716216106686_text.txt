School Description
 
Welcome to Metteer Elementary School, Home of the Mustangs!  Our mission is to educate all 
students to high 
levels of academic performance based on the Common Core State Standards, while 
developing responsible citizens who are independent thinkers and lifelong learners.  The Metteer 
staff pledges itself to these student outcomes.  Our vision is to create a schoo
l environment where 
children, staff and parents work productively and effectively to support the success of each student.  
This involves mutual respect, cooperation and responsibility on the part of the entire school 
community.
 
 
Metteer students, parents
 
and staff strive for high quality student work within a safe, enriching 
environment, utilizing a wide variety of resources and strategies.  Metteer serves a diverse TK 
through 5th grade student population that represents the best of Red Bluff. As a staff 
and school 
community, we are committed to working together in order to meet our goals and focus on the 
needs of each learner.
 
 
We welcome parent and community volunteers throughout our school in order to support the 
classroom learning 
environment. We take pride in our positive and safe school community. Family 
involvement is important to our students' success and we seek opportunities throughout the year 
to celebrate and involve our families. We have an active parent/school staff organi
zation called the 
Metteer Booster Club. We work together to support a variety of activities that build community, 
family
-
school connectedness, and increased academic success. These traditions help to create a 
welcoming and supportive environment at Metteer
.
 
 
Metteer offers a
 
multi
-
tiered framework of academic, social
-
emotional, and behavioral support 
and intervention. We have a robust intervention program for ELA/ELD and Mathematics that 
supports our learners' needs, as well as a program for gifted and ta
lented students. Progress across 
all three tiers is monitored systematically throughout the year. Adjustments are made to classroom 
instruction, academic learning goals, intervention programs, and extensions. Social
-
emotional and 
behavioral supports includ
e access to individual and group counseling, classroom access and use of 
social
-
emotional learning curriculum, Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS), 
recognition of positive student behavior, and proactive communication between staff, students
 
and families. A partnership with the Tehama County SERRF after school program extends support 
for our students beyond the regular school day. The program provides students with adult 
supervision, homework help, and recreational opportunities daily until 6
:00 p.m.
 
 
It is an honor to be the principal of Metteer, where we are focused on bringing forth the best in our 
students and building a positive school community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by st
ate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requ
ired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is t
o be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school 
district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Metteer encourages all parents to become actively involved in their child's education. We invite parents to volunteer in the 
classrooms, accompany 
classes on field 
trips, and share their special skills and abilities. We encourage parents to attend conferences and gain knowledge about scho
ol programs, 
procedures, and interventions. We solicit parent feedback through surveys and promote open communication about how we 
might improve their child's 
school experience. We provide parent education classes during daytime and evening hours throughout the school year, focusing 
on topics that are 
important to the success of all children.
 
 
We have several active parent committee
s, including the English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), the District English Learner Advisory Committee 
(DELAC), the Metteer School Site Council (SSC), and the Metteer Booster Club. These committees and councils meet on a regular
 
basis throughout the 
y
ear and are responsible for informing and supporting the educational goals and priorities of Metteer School. ELAC and DELAC a
re comprised of our 
Hispanic/Latino parent stakeholder group. Site Council (SSC) is comprised of parents/community members, along w
ith staff. SSC develops the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement, a document which ties federal funds expenditures from Title I to academic progress, positive school 
climate, and parent 
engagement. The Metteer Booster Club meets monthly and is responsible f
or organizing events and annual fundraisers, designed to increase family 
involvement, student engagement and school connectedness. The funds they raise are contributed back to the school to support 
field trips and other 
needs.
 
 
Parent involvement is acti
vely solicited at Back to School Night, at conference times, and at various points throughout the school year. Parents are 
personally invited by staff to participate, contacted through our automated phone system, and provided with written communica
tions an
d reminders. 
Events are advertised on our school bulletin boards, web site, and school marquee. Though we encourage all parents to be an a
ctive part of our school, 
we do not disregard safety. We have an approval process for volunteers and we work with loca
l law enforcement to ensure student safety is maintained.

General Operations: salaries, benefits, services, and materials
 

 
Special Education: programs offering 
appropriate, individualized instruction to students with special needs
 

 
Transportation
 

 
Maintenance and Operations
 

 
Special Projects: any monies from agencies (federal or state) earmarked for specific programs, projects or services
 
Each school receives an ins
tructional budget based on enrollment, programs, and formulas set by Board of Education policy, state law, agreements with 
bargaining units, and guidelines of outside funding sources. The School Site Council (SSC) meets approximately once a month t
o develo
p, implement, 
monitor, and evaluate the school plan for student achievement. School plans align with the district's Local Control Accountab
ility Plan (LCAP). Parent 
representatives are elected to the School Site Council and serve two year terms. All parent
s are welcome and encouraged to attend these meetings, as 
well as the District Advisory Committee (DAC) meetings, as a way to learn more about our school funding and academic goals. T
he DAC is a district
-
wide 
committee with various representatives includin
g parents.
