School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-
20
 
 
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa

-

A
 
Cabrillo team consisting of administrators, teachers, staff and parents came together for a two day Parent Engagement 
Learning Institute designed to build the capacity of the school team to develop, implement and evaluate family 
engagement practices that 
lead to increased academic outcomes. At the Institute, the team learned to align family 
engagement practices with the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and LCAP goals and priorities. The team also 
learned to develop, implement and evaluate family 
engagement practices as a professional learning community. The team 
will meet for follow
-
up meetings to execute the plan, evaluate the practices and develop additional actions.
 
 
The PTO at Cabrillo provides funds and volunteer support for our visual and pe
rforming arts program, field trips, assembly

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our staff members supervise students and monitor school grounds throughout each day and we routinely review school 

 
badge while on 
school grounds and sign out when they leave.
 
 
Our Safety Plan is updated and reviewed with staff members at the beginning of each school year and is available for 
review at the school and on the school website. The Safety Plan outlines responsibilities and
 
procedures for everyone on 
site in the event of a school
-

flexibility if emergency procedures need to be implemented.
 
 
The Safety Plan includes The Big Five Safety Prot
ocol, which describes five immediate action responses in a given 
emergency. These include: Shelter in Place; Drop, Cover, and Hold on; Secure Campus; Lockdown/Barricade; and 
Evacuation.  School site emergency drills are held monthly to simulate staff and s
tudent actions during an emergency.  
After each drill, the school debriefs and revises emergency guidelines accordingly.
 
 
We keep emergency supplies on campus such as first aide supplies, food, water, and a generator that provides electricity 
to our multip
urpose room. Our site also has a satellite phone in the event of disrupted landline and cellular service.  District 
personnel, local officials, and our county office of education contributed to the development our safety plan.

the New Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and are continuing conversations around appropriate curriculum.  There 
i
s at least one monthly meeting with the entire staff where all areas of school life are discussed and the school calendar is 
updated.  The teachers also receive support from the District through Humanities, Math and Innovation Specialists.  On

Teachers at Cabrillo also 
search for opportunities to grow as 21st Century Educators, by signing up for workshops and 
other PD opportunities on their own.  Also discussed are Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) and other 
ways to promote a positive school climate, whi
le eliminating incidents of bullying.
