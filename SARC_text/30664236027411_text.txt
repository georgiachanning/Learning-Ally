Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The vision of AESD is to
 
create an exceptional learning environment that engages, challenges, and supports all students 
so that they thrive and achieve their academic potential every year, while preparing them to pursue college and career 
opportunities to 
become competitive global citizens.
 
 
The vision for e²STEAM
-
D (equitable and engaging science, 
technology, engineering, art, math and dual language immersion) education in Anaheim Elementary School District is to 
empower school communities to integrate sci
ence, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics, and Dual Language 
Immersion through the process of critical thinking, communication, creativity, and collaboration to foster innovation not 
just for today, but the future.
 
 
Core Strategy:
  
In order to incre
ase the achievement of all students and close the achievement gap, all professionals will 
build meaningful student relationships and collaborate in data
-
informed learning communities to ensure the engagement 
of all students in a rigorous curriculum.
 
 
Profe
ssional Learning is offered in a variety of flexible formats and structures to meet the diverse professional and 
personal needs of teachers. Such structures include both in person and virtual training and are offered after school, during 
off track time, on
 
Saturdays and/ or through the provision of a substitute when possible. Additionally, all schools are 
provided with on site specific professional development as needed through district curriculum specialist and off site 
conference attendance.
 
 
Job embedded
 
professional learning is provided by a site instructional coach and/or facilitated 
through both peer learning opportunities. All schools have a full time instructional coach who facilitate a student centered 
coaching framework and maximize individualized 
professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
planning/teaching, PLCs, peer learning walks and provide professional learning.
 
 
Professional Learning areas of focused are identified through analysis of both formative and summative data.
 
 
All
 
unduplicated student groups ELA and Math summative data as reported by summative and interim CAASPP test items 
indicate a gap of achievement from the standard met indicator.
 
 
To meet these identified students needs the following professional learning has 
transpired:

All schools have support from a full time or half time Curriculum Coach and shared Digital Learning coac
h to help apply 
professional learning through co
