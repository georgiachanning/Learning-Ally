School Description
 
Carl Harvey Elementary School (Harvey) is an award
-
winning National Blue Ribbon School (2010), a 
California Distinguished School (2006 and 2010), and a Title I 
Academic Achievement Award Winner 
(2011). We are located in the southwest neighborhood of the city of Santa Ana. At Harvey, a sense 
of family is very important to us. We believe that all constituents in the school community (staff, 
students, parents and ed
ucational partners) play a vital role in the success of our school programs 
and ultimately, student achievement. You will see a clean learning environment where all children 
are safe, responsible, and respectful in their learning and in their actions all a
round the campus. 
Student achievement is measured through formative assessments (MAP, DIBELS, STAR) as well as 
summative assessments (SBAC, ELPAC). The results of these assessments inform instructional 
practices and also provide students opportunities to s
et goals for their own achievement. We are 
excited about the continued implementation of the Common Core State Standard and the 
continued implementation of our language arts program (Benchmark Advance) and our math 
program (Math Expressions).  We are pleas
ed to begin preparing our students to be college and 
career ready in the 21st century.
 
 
School Mission:
 
Carl Harvey staff members are committed to providing an academically challenging, standards

partners and the important role they play in the academic and social

emotional development of 
the students. We will work 
together to create a positive and caring environment that promotes 
intellectual development, encourages creativity, values diversity, and establishes a tradition for

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.
