School Description
 
Pulliam's Mission: Pulliam Elementary ensures a safe and 
positive environment so that all students learn at 
grade level or higher.
 
 
Pulliam's Vision: Pulliam Elementary will be a high performing school where staff, families and community 
members collaborate to ensure that all students engage in a rigorous instru
ctional and enrichment program 
so that they will be successful in high school and post
-
secondary pursuits.
 
 
In order to work toward achieving Pulliam's vision, the staff has narrowed the focus to three categories. These 
categories are: student achievement,
 
response to intervention and culture. The three initiatives to ensure that 
each decision is made based on the three categories are: Professional Learning Communities, Advancement 
Via Individual Determination (AVID) and Positive Behavior Intervention Syste
m (PBIS) In an effort to raise 
student achievement all teachers are provided professional development connected to the initiatives and 
support throughout the year from administration and the instructional coach. Students are recognized 
monthly for their ac
ademics and behavior and parents/families are invited to campus quarterly as the teachers 
showcase their student's demonstration of learning.
 
 
The SMART Goal for our PLC initiative is that  85% of collaborative teams will implement the PLC process with 
fid
elity by the end of the 2019/2020 school year.
 
 
The SMART Goal for AVID is that 85% of teachers will implement organization of WICOR by using binders and 
planners by the end of the 2019/2020 school year and 100% of teachers that attended summer institute w
ill 
use two or three column notes, leveled questioning and one collaborative structure by the end of the 
2019/2020 school year.
 
 
The SMART Goal for PBIS is that 100% of Pulliam staff will implement the PAWS program with fidelity by the 
end of the 2019/2020
 
school year.

https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of
 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formu
la (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local
 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, par
ents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California Stat
e University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
