About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Frank Paul School provides a safe and clean environment for learning. Our custodial staff consists of a lead day custodian an
d two evening custodians. 
Each classroom, restroom, and offi
ce is cleaned daily. District personnel maintain landscaping and provide other operational services. If the need arises, 
a work order is placed and repairs are made.
 
 
Frank Paul is a 30
-
year
-
old modular school, with an additional 10 rooms added two years a
go.   The school consists of 33 regular classrooms and four 
preschool classrooms, one of which is an outside facility, which rents out the space. Our school has only three permanent bui
ldings: our multipurpose 
room and two classrooms. Our multipurpose room
 
serves as our cafeteria and events center.  In case of inclement weather we use our satellite cafeteria 
to help manage the number of children out a the same time.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Frank Paul encourages our parents to participate in several organizations and activities. There are a variety of opportunitie
s for parent involvement 
depending on their interests.  Throughout the 2018
-
19 school year, three sta
keholders meetings were calendared to make sure parent ideas were heard 
by the Alisal Union School District.    Along with these stakeholders meetings, School Site Council, and the assistance of ad
ministration, financial decisions 
were carefully calculated
 
for all students.   Meetings bring community organizations on campus to talk about services and provide them as needed.   The
 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), which works alongside our School Site Council, discusses issues pertinent to Engl
ish 
Learners and makes 
decisions accordingly.   District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) members represent our English Learner issues at 
the district level and update 
our members at our site.   After school enrichment program tutorials provide ideas
 
and activities that parents can use to help their children at home.  For 
parent involvement opportunities at Frank Paul Elementary School, please contact the principal, Mr. Miguel Porras at (831) 75

School Safety Plan
 
Maintaining a safe and orderly campus is our main concern. Staff 
members monitor the school grounds before and after school, at recess, and at lunch 
time. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe and responsible behavior and are active in making changes, which keep our 
students and staff prepared 
and safe. Visitors 

event of an 
emergency.
 
Our School Safety Plan is revised annually as was the case this year.   The plan includes procedures for eme
rgencies, exit routes, roles and responsibilities 
for staff members, and inventories of emergency supplies. We share the plan with all staff members at  staff meetings.  In ad
dition, the school site council 
helps with revisions and approval. Students and s
taff practice fire and earthquake drills four times a year and lock
-
down procedures twice a year. In 
addition, we hold annual emergency preparedness training for staff, as needed.  ALICE ( Alert Lockdown Inform Counter Evacuat
e ) trainings have trained 
adm
inistrators, students, and parents.  These trainings are ongoing and make sure that our school remains a safe heaven for all 
students who enter our 
doors.  Safety for all, continues to be one of our primary concerns!
