By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Ishi Hills Middle School is located in the Oroville City Elementary School District in Oroville, California. The town is loca

purpose room, and a building that houses the school 
library and main office.
 
 
The staff 
consists of 13 regular education teachers, including a shared music teacher and three qualified SDC/resource 
teachers.  The principal and teachers are supported by the following staff: Secretary, Attendance Clerk, Parent 
Coordinator, Check In and Check Out

At Ishi Hills Middle School, we wan

once a month. Parent volunteers are encouraged by the administration and teachers to assist in the classroom. Each 
month, teachers select a Student of the Month and, d
uring a school
-
wide assembly, they are recognized for this award. 
Parents are notified prior to the assembly and invited to attend. Parents are actively involved in other school activities 
such as: School Site Council; Back to School Night; Open House; Ban
d concerts; Parent Conferences and other 
opportunities throughout the school year. Ishi Hills uses Aeries Parent Portal, an on
-
line grade book,  to help communicate 
student progress throughout the year. All students in the school are given a portal account
 
and are able to look at their 
grades and homework completion.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

honors the reciprocal responsibility which exists between the home and the school in the education of children. For this 
reason, conti
nued parental involvement in the education of children contributes greatly to student achievement and 

to education. Parents and guardians
 
are strongly encouraged to communicate with school personnel so the home and 
school are reinforcing the same goals and values the parents have set for their children. The Oroville City Elementary 
School District shall include parent involvement strategies
 
as a component of instructional planning for all programs.
 
 
 
Teachers, parents, and guardians can better understand and meet student needs if they work together. All school 
programs have a duty to communicate frequently with the home and to help parents a
nd guardians develop skills and 
family management techniques with support classroom learning. School staff will keep parents informed about school 
expectations. The parents will be informed regarding how they can assist their children in support of classro
om learning 
activities. The Board encourages staff training in effective communication with the home.
 
 
 
Back to School Night: This is an opportunity for parents to meet teachers and be introduced to curriculum and classroom 
procedures. Everyone meets in th

Parent Club: Believing that education requires a shared active commitment, the Parent Club is the bridge to link students, 
teachers, school, and community members to produc

motivated to continue learning. This is a parent initiated and maintained organization with more than a sixty year history.

based Coordinated Program (SBCP) were 
established, they were envisioned as ways to increase school

wide effectiveness, improve student achievement, and 
better prepare students to be productive workers and responsible citizens. One of the principal te

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety issues at Ishi Hills Middle School are addressed monthly with staff members and unsafe conditions are quickly 
reported to district maintenance. The school safety plan is reviewed annually, to better prepare for and to address
 
safety 
issues specific to each site, as well as to the district as a whole. We have monthly fire and disaster  drills. We have recen
tly 
modified our lockdown procedures and practice them regularly. A copy of the School Safety Plan, including the middle 
sc
hool bully policy, is available in the office.
 
 
The plan is currenty under review by staff, and is discussed during staff meetings.  Each year the Safety plan is approved 
by the School Site Council. As a district, Oroville City Elementary School District h
as fewer than 2500 students. We have a 
district safety plan that encompases all schools. Ishi does have its own plan that was thoroughly updated at the end of the 
2017 school year. Our plan highlights bomb threats, earthquakes, failure of Oroville Dam, fir
e on or near campus, lockdown 
procedures, and child abuse. We discuss the evacuation of the school and where students and parents should be picked 
up in case of emergency.

Opportunities for personal growth are numerous and varied. Staff development at the District level conforms to the 
curriculum emphasis of the State and county textbook adoption cycle. 
Staff development days have been used for training 
staff, planning curriculum improvements and parent
-
teacher conferencing.
 
 
A growth

oriented atmosphere exists within the faculty and is supported by the administration. Experts among the faculty, 
as well a
s guest presenters, provide training for staff. Teachers may also attend workshops away from school when 
appropriate.
 
 

reading/language arts, mathem
atics, science and social studies. There are several steps that are used to align program 
with District adopted standards: utilization of district assessments currently aligned; alignment of standards with weekly 
lesson plans objectives; and development of
 
tools for teacher classroom use and communication with parents. Math and 
Language Arts teachers participated in grade level meetings, with a focus on student achievement at all achievement 
levels.
 
 
With the integration of technology there have been multip
le opportunities for staff to attend conferences as well as have 
County support monthly in their classrooms. As a district we have moved to the Google Apps for Education suite and we 
have worked together as a staff to increase our capacities with these app
s as well as Google Classroom.
 
 
The Butte County Office of Education provides training for teachers in restorative practices, MTSS, and PBIS through after 
school workshops.
