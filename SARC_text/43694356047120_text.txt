About the SA
RC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Co
ntrol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to addr
ess 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Ava
ilability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional ma
terials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom
 
and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned with the California Stat
e 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
acc
ording to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the
 
school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 
2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cadwallader Elementary School, originally constructed in 1966, is currently comprised of 20 permanent classrooms, eight 
portable classrooms, a 
computer lab, a library, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a staff lounge, and three playgrounds. Over the past five years, the 
school has been painted, the 
parking area has been upgraded, and improvements to electrical and data circuit
s have been completed. Other upgrades include rubber matting installed 
on the playgrounds, new track lighting in the multipurpose room, and a new hot water heater. The chart displays the results o
f the most recent facilities 
inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Cadwallader Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has ado
pted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the sc
hool year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, saf
e, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

eavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation 
periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by Evergreen School District to ensure that 
school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immedia
te attention. Em
ergency 
repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received
.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, an
d floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School Distri
ct has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good repair.

positive activities. The SSC/ELAC meets regularly to monitor the instructional program and give input regarding the School Si
te Plan.
 
 
In addition to daily classroom volunteer opportunities, and attending field trips, our PTA sponsors events such as Trunk 
or Treat, Family Valentine's 
Dance, Family Bingo Night, Family Movie Night, and our PTA Book Fairs.
 
 
Parents have also gotten involved in the Walk and Roll program that the City of San Jose is sponsoring through a multi
-
year grant. Wednesdays are Walk 
and 
Roll days where parents are encouraged to walk to school with their students to be involved in a school
-
wide event, to get some healthy exercise, 
and to help with the traffic congestion around the school.   Parents also volunteer as crossing guards to help
 
with the direction of traffic in the front of 
the school.
 
 
Cadwallader also receives support from numerous local businesses and community organizations. Continual program support and d
onations from 
Evergreen Valley Church, Lucky, Office Depot, Wells Fargo
 
Bank, and the City of San Jose have added to the quality of instruction and have enhanced our 
school environment.

2015 teachers participated in professional development for Visual Thinking Strategies during the transition to Common Core 
Standards.  This was part of a three year professional development plan.  Beginning in the 2015
-
2016 school year Cadwallader started a focus on the use 
of Accountable Talk.
 
 
For the 2017
-
2018 school year, Accountable Talk is a strategy all teachers are cont
inuing to use within content areas. Students use complete sentences 
in order to build on collaborative conversations while including evidence to support their statements.  Also in 2017
-
2018, our site instructional coach 
began focused work with our kinderga
rten and first grade teachers to implement the Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program at our site.  
Second and third grade teachers began training in the 2018
-
2019 school year.  By the end of the 2019
-
2020 school year, the rotation of two year 
prof
essional development will be completed for kindergarten, first , second, and third grades.
 
 
Annually, the district schedules a staff development day where sites plan professional development for staff based on staff i
nput and needs.  Professional 
Learning C
ommunities are formed at every grade level to focus on a need for that grade level.  The third Wednesday and the second site 
Thursday 
meeting are set aside monthly for focus on PLC work.  Grade level meetings take place the second Wednesday of each month. 
 
The fourth Wednesday 
of each month is for staff coaching meetings that focus on discussing students of concern and how to address their needs.  Th
is coaching process supports 
our referral system for Student Study Team meetings.
 
 
For the 2019
-
2020 academic 
year, the PLC focus for our site is integrated and designated instruction for our English Language Learners.
