Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to 
calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who receive
d 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
 
1. To 
provide a safe and secure learning environment where students will achieve at their maximum potential and become 
effective citizens: and,
 
2. To promote and maintain a caring and connected school community where all stakeholders are safe and secure.
 
 
Under 
each goal, appropriate activities are identified and implemented. For example, under Goal 1, the following are 
implemented:
 
 

 
2.  School gates will be locked at all times.
 
3.  Students will travel with a 
buddy when they leave a classroom.
 
4.  All yard
-
duty personnel will wear colored vests all the time while they are supervising students on the playground. They 
will also be equipped with radios to communicate quickly with the front office.

Under Goal 2, the following examples are implemented:
 
 
1.  Review the goals and objectives of the Safety Plan with school personnel, School Site Council, and English Learner 
Advisory Committee (ELAC).
 
2.  F

 
3.  Train new teachers in our schoolwide Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) Plan and PeaceBuilders Program.
 
4.  Acknowledge students positive efforts and behaviors
 
via weekly PBIS and PeaceBuilders Praise Slip Drawings.
 
 
In implementing the appropriate strategies and programs, Providencia provides a high level of school safety.  Additionally, 
the Burbank Police Department has assigned a School Resource Officer to pr
ovide service and assistance to parents and 

 
 
On December 9, 2019 Providencia's School Site Council/Safety Committee approved the Safe School Plan. On January 14, 
2020 the Safe School Plan was presented at a public meeting.  I
n addition to the ongoing goals mentioned above, this year 
we will focus on the following two goals:
 
 
1.  We need to decrease the amount of tardies and unexcused absences, while focusing on the students who are at risk of 
being chronically absent.  We hope
 
this focus will lead to a 10% reduction in the number of students who are chronically 
absent.
 
 
2.  To increase student and staff safety on campus and the surrounding areas during normal school days and during 
emergency situations (earthquake, active shoot
er, shelter in place).
