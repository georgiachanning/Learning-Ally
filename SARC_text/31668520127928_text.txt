School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

The
 
PBIS Tier I and PBIS Tier II teams meet monthly to review SWIS data and identify trends. Ongoing support and effective 
strategies to address the identified trends are provided to all staff to ensure an effective approach to address any 
behavioral concerns
. Staff and students receive training on the district's PBIS expectations at the start of each academic 
school year and updates with additional training and resources throughout the year during monthly Professional Learning

SAFETY DRI
LLS
 
Regular fire, evacuation, and lock down drills occur throughout the school year. Detailed plans are drafted and reviewed 
after all drills to ensure the safety and well
-
being of all students in the event of a school wide emergency. The staff have 
specif
ic responsibilities during these drills that replicate duties in the event of an actual emergency. The fire department 
and other health and safety specialists are available for many of the drills to provide feedback to administration for 
continuous improve
ment in assuring the most effective and safest procedures and processes. Each classroom is equipped 
with a first aid and lock
-
down kit. Rocklin Academy Gateway also participates in annual fire inspections.
 
 
 
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
 
All hazardous materials are 
stored in a locked cabinet in the janitorial closet. The janitorial closets automatically lock upon 
closure to ensure student safety. The material safety data sheets (MSDS), are kept and managed by our lead custodian. 
Copies of these sheets are readily ava
ilable in the health office and electronically.

information provided by parent(s) and/or medical providers. Copies of these Individual Health Plans are kept in the health 
office and 
are accessible to all staff when needed. Electronic copies are also distributed to teachers and administration. 
Other staff members are notified of theseIndividualized Health Plans as needed when working with students. All

medications needed on overnight field trips, parents are required to complete an overnight field trip medical form, signed 
by a physician, giving specific instructions of disbursement t

During CI meetings, teachers analyze data gathered from student work and develop strategies and common assessments 
to address the varying learning needs of our individual students. Teachers and administrators clos
ely monitor academic 
growth of subgroups of students:  English Learners, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, and students receiving Special 
Education. Enrichment Block is part of each academic school day for a minimum of two days a week for 30
-
40 minutes 
each
 
block.  Enrichment Block is a time where no new instruction takes place and teachers have the opportunity to work 
with individual students or small groups of students on a concept(s) or standard in which the student is not yet 
demonstrating proficiency.  
In addition, students who are proficient in this area are provided the opportunity to enrich 
their learning by extending their depth of knowledge through various hands on learning opportunities. Enrichment 
Support Specialists partner with classroom teacher
s to analyze data and support students with specific needs during the 
Enrichment Block.
 
 
Teachers and administrators focus professional learning opportunities at the beginning of the year, as well as throughout 
the school year, to deepen their knowledge an
d enrich lessons that support student mastery of Common Core Standards.
