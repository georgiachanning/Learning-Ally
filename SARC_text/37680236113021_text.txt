School Description
 
Olympic View School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including 
charters. Olympic View was built in 1995. Each of its five academic buildings has four classrooms 
and a workroom. Fourteen permanent portables have been added
 
to accommodate Olympic View's 
growth.
 
 
Mission:
 
 
The Olympic View Community believes that ALL students, staff, parents and community members 
are leaders.  We are a Leader in Me school and focus on developing the 7 habits of highly effective 
people.  Stude
nts are encouraged to develop and share their passion by leading others.  Students 
are given input on the decisions made at the school as well as developing clubs, leading initiatives, 
and leading activities and programs at our school.
 
 
The Olympic View co
mmunity believes ''It takes an entire village to raise a child.'' Our children are 
at the center of all our decisions. Olympic View Elementary School provides a rigorous, well
-
balanced education, preparing students for the 21st Century.
 
 
We value the devel
opment of the whole child. At Olympic View, students reach their highest 
potential intellectually, physically, emotionally, and socially. Building on a strong foundation of 
academics, students acquire the skills to be literate, creative, constructive, and 
contributing 
citizens.
 
 
Olympic View students are prepared to compete in a technologically advanced world. They value 
tolerance, respect and diversity. Upon leaving Olympic View, students are responsible, resilient, 
lifelong learners who ''make every minut
e count''. Students appreciate Olympic View as an 
essential building block in their personal and academic growth.
 
 
Our entire community embodies the Olympic spirit by modeling positive human relations. Families, 
students, staff, community, and businesses w
ork together to make decisions while accepting the 
responsibility for the success of our children. We ensure a safe environment in which all individuals 
have a sense of belonging and everyone is treated with dignity and respect. Olympic View serves 
as a ce
nter where activities and programs enrich the entire community in the areas of fine arts, 
academics, technology, and physical well being. The Olympic View community is dedicated to 
preparing our students for the ever
-
changing future. Olympic View's Shared 
Vision is the result of 
collaboration among students, staff, parents, EastLake High School, EastLake Middle School, the 
EastLake Educational Foundation, and community businesses.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
la
w to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required t
o prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
c
onsistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Classroom space at Olympic View Elementary School is adequate to support our school's current enrollment.  The District maint
ains a planned program, 
which ensures routine 
maintenance functions are performed on a scheduled basis.  The District re
-
carpeted Olympic View facilities in July 2014. The 
Olympic View custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations daily while restrooms are monitored hourly.
 
 
Olympic View has a se
cured campus with six outside entry areas.  There are two vehicle entrances into separate parking lots and drop
-
off/pick
-
up zones. 
Traffic patterns are monitored often to insure safety during times when students are picked up and dropped off. One of our no
on duties has extended 
hours to monitor traffic flow in the South pick
-
up area.  Adjustments to traffic patterns are discussed with the entire school community before permanent 
changes are made. There is always supervision in front of the school during dis
missal time by the principal, and/or school staff.   No student should 
remain on campus in an unsupervised area or activity. Students leaving campus during school hours must be checked out through
 
the office by an adult 

rd.  The teacher will be notified and the student will be dismissed to the office area.  Any visitors to the school must 
check in and out through the main office's Raptor system.

s calculated by 
taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students 
who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

Parents and parent organizations have been a continuing source of support and partnership for us.  Parents, through School Si
te Council (SSC), Parent
-
Teacher Club (OPTC), Multicultural Family Association (MFA) also known as the English Learner Advi
sory Committee (ELAC), and schoolwide committees 
assist in decision
-
making at Olympic View. Volunteers provide valuable resources, giving their time, talent, and energy. Olympic View parents ha
ve 
generously donated hardware and software to the school. They
 
also help us obtain these resources from their places of employment and other 
community member contacts.
 
 
Parents lead the way in many of our school activities.  Some of these are:  Packet Pick up Night, Back to School BBQ, Fall Fe
stival, Book Fair, Fun R
un, 
Kid's Heart Challenge, Valentine's Dance, Holiday Craft Night.
 
 
Parent volunteers have been extremely helpful in assisting with Safety Patrol, GATE program, library, classrooms, assemblies,
 
and on field trips. 
Volunteers are honored each year by Olympi
c View administration, staff, and students at Volunteer Appreciation Assemblies and throughout the year.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Each year, targeted professional improvement activities are provided for teachers, instructional aides, and other employees. 
Activities reflect the school's 
goals and objectives and are part of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). A variety of d
ata reports are used to analyze growth towards 
meeting achievement goals as described in the SPSA. Professional Development sessions are held on modified Fridays at school,
 
whole day or half day 
trainings away from school, and after school on a voluntary b
asis.
 
 
In 2014
-
15, staff received PD by attending District academies and sessions provided by the site Resource Teacher.  The ELA focus has 
evolved to increase 
student achievement in reading comprehension by integrating reading and writing, listening, and 
speaking.  PD is on the implementation of text 
complexity, writing from different sources, and explicit and incidental vocabulary.  Professional Development In
-
services for Achieve 3000 is conducted 
to engage teachers in the full features of this program f
or 2nd through 6th grades.
 
 
The mathematical focus is to integrate the 8 mathematical practices with the CCSS content standards to increase student achie
vement.  PD is on the 
implementation of Eureka Math and conceptual understanding along with student exp
ertise in skills.
 
 
Three hours of collaboration time two times per quarter for each grade level is provided for staff to work together in implem
enting the CCSS in the 
curriculum.
 
 
In 2015
-
16, based on CAASPP and local measure data, the school's ELA focus o
n increasing student achievement in reading comprehension by integrating 
reading, writing, listening, and speaking was continued.  The school Resource Teacher, conducted monthly professional develop
ment for staff on the 4T's 
(text structure, text features,
 
text complexity, and implicit/explicit text vocabulary) and the 4E's (evidence, elaboration, example, and explanation) to 
support evidence
-
based responses in both speaking and writing.
 
 
In the area of math, there was a continued focus on the 8 mathematica
l practices in conjunction with the CCSS to increase student achievement.  All 
teachers attended a summer professional development session in mathematics.  In addition, our school Resource Teacher worked 
with staff on 
accountable talk in the classroom with
 
a focus on questioning, prompting, and cueing to increase student discourse.
 
 
Furthermore, teachers were supported through multiple trainings with Achieve 3000 representatives to focus on instructional t
echnology to support 
critical thinking and problem
-
s
olving.
 
 
Teachers also received three hours of collaboration time two times per quarter for each grade level to work together in imple
menting the Common Core 
State Standards and specifically focus on the areas of language and math instruction as mentioned 
above.
 
 
In 2016
-
17, based on CAASPP and local measures data, the school's focus moved toward mathematical problem
-
solving to improve students 
achievement.
 
 
The District Resource Teacher met with each grade level every Friday in August and 
September to ensure all teachers were aware of the available math 
resources and how to use them.

A Math Parent Training was conducted in mid
-
September.  Additionally, the District Resource Teacher met with the whole staff for vertical math 
collaboration in
 
December 2016.   Mathematically strategies such as number talks, problem
-
solving, student discourse, and math academic vocabulary 
were implemented in Kindergarten through 6th grade.
 
 
The Disctrict GLAD Resource Teachers provided professional development o
n incorporating GLAD strategies in math.
 
 
During collaboration time, teachers viewed model lessons, co
-
taught, and coached each other in small group instruction guided by our Resource Teacher.
 
 
Teachers also received 1.5 hours of collaboration time every w
eek for each grade level to work together to implement the Common Core State Standards 
and specifically focus on the area of math instruction to increase student learning.
 
 
In 2018
-
19 Our School focus was Deepening thinking and understanding around math pr
oblem solving through collaborative conversations and 
discussions while enhancing student efficacy and social emotional growth.  This focus was chosen based on data analysis of th
e SBAC, Hanover and Ca. 
Healthy Kids survey.
 
 
In Sept. 18, we started our fir
st professional learning cycle with SEL with Sanford Harmony.  Our resource teacher met with the whole staff for Sanford 
Harmony Training.  Teachers had time to work with the curriculum and support each other and then we had a round of observatio
ns that co
ncluded with 
a virtual walkthrough.
 
 
In October, our ILT presented on student efficacy and success criteria.  We followed this with training from our District mat
h and science resource teacher 
in the 3 reads problem solving strategy.  Our resource teacher 
modeled and co taught lessons on this strategy. Teachers had the opportunity to observe 
each other and then we followed with a round of observations. District resource teacher then met in collaboration with each g
rade level and trained 
them in using the fr
amework to develop learning intentions, success criteria and to make sure instruction is rooted in the standards.
 
 
In January, school wide we looked at a problem solving standard K
-
6 and discussed the progression of learning intentions.
 
 
For the 19
-
20 School year, we are continuing our focus from 18
-
19 and going deeper.  We are also focused on SEL and we received Silver Recognition for 
Tier I implementation.  We are working on Tier II this year and focused on behavior supports.  We are als
o embarking on Leader In Me, as this is our first 
year of implementation.
 
 
We had 7 habits training in both July and October, as well as on site coaching from a Leader in Me Coach.  We have developed 
a Lighthouse Team that is 
in charge of the timeline for 
roll out.  Each teacher has committed to being on a passion team that is led by one of the lighthouse members.  The Passion 
Teams consist of: Adult Professional Learning, Student Learning, Environment, Leadership Events, Family Learning, Student Lea
rning.
