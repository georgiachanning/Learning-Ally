School Vision:
 
 
Lake Marie School strives to create a relationship between home, school, and community that 
promotes cultural sensitivity, instills a strong foundational passion for reading and

and community stakeholders will empower students to prepare for an ever changing, competitive 
and complex world.
 
 
Principal's Message,
 
 
Lake Mar

and respectful environment. We promote differentiated instruction with the goal of addressing 
individual student needs.  The students, parents, and staff of Lake Mari
e School all have a single 
focus: student achievement through Common Core State Standards, technology, and the district 
core
-

taught monthly, reinforcing specif
ic artistic techniques. Think Together, our after
-
school care 
provider, offers a variety of extra
-
curricular opportunities and academic support for all Lake Marie 
students. Working together with the school, they promote after
-
school sports teams where 
stud

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lake Marie Elementary School has 16 classrooms, a Multi
-
Purpose Room, and an administra
tion building. The main campus was built in 1954 and was 
modernized in 2001 and 2018. In August 2011, the Multipurpose Room was retiled in a vinyl composite tile and the kindergarten
 
play area was completely 
repaved with new asphalt with paint stripping. A
dditionally, the school arcades (covered walkways) were replaced in June/July of 2013.
 
 
The school custodian and district maintenance staff ensure the school is kept in good condition and repairs are made, via a w
ork order system. Work 
orders are processed
 
in a timely manner and emergency repairs are given the highest priority. A district safety consultant inspects each site annu
ally and 

lity collaboration provides 
annual site inspections.
 
 
The principal works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. In addition, in
spects the campus on a daily 
basis and communicates findings with custodial s

education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

The Lake Marie parents have the opportunity to
 
support and participate in our educational program. They are invited to attend Coffee With the Principal 
to obtain information and resources about our academic instructional goals, walk classrooms to observe teaching and learning;
 
and to provide feedback 
to the principal. In addition, they are invited to volunteer as classroom helpers and chaperones on annual field trips. They 
attend Back to School Night, 
Open House, parent conferences, student performance programs, and trimester awards assemblies. They ar
e active members of the PTA and serve as 
voting members of the School Site Council. Parents represent the school at district advisory committee meetings as well as th


ts for All Program, coordinating programs such as Meet the Masters, assisting with student 
art projects, and classroom creative learning opportunities.
 
 
An annual survey is given to parents to gain information about types of parent education classes that p
arents are interested in attending. The contact 
person for parent involvement is our principal, Lisa Palomino who can be reached at (562) 944

School Safety Plan
 
As required by state law, each school maintains a detailed safety plan. All personnel is trained in emergency procedures and 
students ta
ke part in regularly 
scheduled emergency drills. Food, water, medical and other emergency supplies are updated annually to ensure each campus is r
eady to respond in the 
event of an emergency or disaster. Campuses are carefully monitored before, during and 
after school hours. Break periods and lunch are supervised by 
school personnel. Schools are secured with security fencing. Check
-
in and checkout procedures are also strictly enforced at all campuses and our latest 
School Safety Plan is updated and revised 
annually. This plan is discussed with staff and School Site Council. The District maintains constructive 
relationships with law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of all campuses. Furthermore, Measure QS funding (a general 
obligation bond passed 
by 
area voters to upgrade school facilities).

The primary focus 
areas of professional development are for teachers to be proficient in Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts, 
Math 
and on the CAASPP standardized assessment. For support, teachers received professional developments from Educational Services
,
 
instructional coaches, 
principals, and workshops at Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers are apart of instructional learning walks where
 
they observe their 
colleagues instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and a
ll teachers are being Google trained so they may use it as an 
instructional tool and facilitate students presentations. In 2017
-
2020, teachers participated in GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) and CGI 
(Cognitive Guided Instruction) to assist in eff
ective teaching strategies for all students, especially English Learners. Teachers were participants in 
demonstration lessons and received feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals. All professional devel
opment occurred during 
the 
school day and/or after school in 2017
-
2020.  Teachers have the opportunity to attend English Language Arts, ELD, mathematics, and NGSS 
professional development at LACOE and other educational partnerships .
