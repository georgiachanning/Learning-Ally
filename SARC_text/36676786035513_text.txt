About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. 
Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific 
activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additio
nal information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
On October 3, 2019, the Chino Valley Unified School Distri

and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 
60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including English learner
s, that are 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in th
e following subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructional materials 
were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was 
available for science laboratory classes offered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that
 
each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks an
d instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject areas for the 2019/2020 scho
ol 
year. Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing
 
ar
ts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Board of Edu
cation approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVU
SD elected to continue to use current District adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed cur
rent District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet curr
ent history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of p
aramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact 
safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a re
gular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and c
arried out during breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
chool improvement for this 
site is a schoolwide security came
ra and keyless access system planned for the 2020/2021 school year. To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, 
Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the school sites on a continual basis. School sites may al
so enter mainte
nance 
requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entered into the system, a work order is gener
ated, and the Maintenance 
staff works diligently to complete all work orders in a timely manner. The Maintenance team utilize
d the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), to record inspection results. The overall r

survey is GOOD, and any associated repai
rs were completed on or before December 30, 2019.

In addition to the District inspection that took place on July 10, 2019, representatives from the San Bernardino County Super
intendent of Schools (SBCSS) 
conduct annual Williams visits to schools ranked in
 
deciles 1
-
3 in San Bernardino County to evaluate their "good repair" status. The Williams inspection 
for this site occurred on September 4, 2019. Results from this inspection are included below, and any associated repairs were
 
completed by the end of

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number

School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the S
chool Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are revi
ewed monthly by the School Site Council.  Each 

onents and procedures. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular b
asis so that all students and staff are familiar with emergency procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy reg
arding campus visitors is enforced by requiring 

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visit
ors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all gates remain locked during the 
school day, so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environ
ment that fosters health and safety, in both form and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan as a
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from 
the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect all students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency mana
gement, and pu
blic health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
ritical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School
 
personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. T
he Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimum requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management Syst
em (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Re
gulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607.
