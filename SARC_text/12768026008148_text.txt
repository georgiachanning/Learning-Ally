Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Toddy Thomas School is inspected on a regular basis for a wide variet
y of health and safety items by qualified District and 
non
-
District employees including, but not limited to, the local fire chief, California Highway Patrol Bus Safety Officer, 
insurance, JPA Loss Control and Safety Analyst, Humboldt County Health Departme
nt, and outside private vendors. 
Asbestos in the school is found only in floor tiles, which are covered by carpet and inspected regularly for integrity.
 
 
Toddy Thomas was built in 1950. During the summer of 2012, Bond money was used to update all of the cl
assrooms on 
campus (except the portables). All classrooms and student bathrooms were completely remodeled inside, and technology, 
bells, wiring, and phone systems were all updated. In addition to classrooms, the school has a library, computer lab, music 
po
rtable, counseling portable, two after school program portables, one GATE/EL portable, a multipurpose room, 
basketball courts, and a track. The school grounds have a fully integrated fire alarm systems, video surveillance systems, 
and security alarms. Thes
e are all checked frequently to insure accuracy.
 
 
Toddy Thomas School has a custodial staff of one full
-
time staff member and one part
-
time staff member, and a 
maintenance supervisor with District responsibilities who works full time. The District prides 
itself in making sure all 
facilities are safe and clean, and continues to allocate funds for this reason.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.
