About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In order to provide a safe campus for students, staff and the community, policies and procedures are in place to provide 
structure and order in the 
operation of the school.  After input from the staff and community, the campus was converted to a "closed campus" in the 2018
-
19 school year where 
only students are permitted to enter the campus during the before
-
school recess. T
he staff requests approval of school visitors in advance and that 
information is provided to the front office staff where they assist visitors in the check
-
in process.
 
 
The cleanliness of the school is good and is always a focus for the staff.  At the star
t of every school year, teachers provide students with a tour of the 
school and discuss expectations for keeping the school clean.  A lead custodian and a pm custodian clean the school on a dail
y basis.
 
 
Improvements to the school include the purchase of a
 
new stage for the school in 2017
-
18 after the district installation of new flooring in the MPR.  The 
PTO also purchased sun shades to improve the outdoor eating area for the students. The three play areas were completely chang
ed for the 2018
-
19 
school yea
r whereby new play structures were installed, eliminating the flooding that took place in these areas.
 
 
Needed maintenance includes the improvement of outside lighting, painting and repair of building trim, and on
-
going replacement of ceiling tiles.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
We revise our 
Safe School Plan annually with the last revision occurring in the spring of 2018. The plan includes procedures for emergencie
s, exit routes, 
and inventories of emergency supplies. It is available to view in the school office for parents. The plan is shared
 
during school wide staff meetings. 
Reynolds staff and students practice fire drills monthly, lock down drills, and disaster drills throughout the school year. E
ach year Oceanside Unified 
School district along with the local fire department and police depa
rtment conduct a mock emergency at the school site.  During the mock drill the school 
staff and students are assessed for their quick and immediate response in addressing the crisis in order to ensure safety for
 
all individuals on the campus.  
We hold trai
nings for staff on emergency preparedness at the beginning of each school year and for new staff members as they join us. Tog
ether with 
the Oceanside Police Department, our Safe School Committee developed our Crisis Response Plan.
 
 
The custodial staff insp
ects playground equipment regularly to keep it safe and quickly makes any necessary repairs. Campus Supervisors monitor the 
school grounds for 30 minutes before school and for all recess and lunch periods for students.  During school hours, we have 
a close

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
In alignment with the District's instructional focus, our focus has been the following:  All students will demonstrate their 
thinking, both verbally and in 
writing, to show understanding of their learning.  This instructional focus is embedded in the profe
ssional development opportunities at Reynolds. In 
addition, there is a focus on language arts instruction in order to support student achievement in these areas.
 
 
The teaching staff at Reynolds Elementary is diligent in utilizing the professional developme
nt opportunities to further develop their instructional 
practice.  Teachers participate in Professional Learning Community meetings with their grade level partners.  These meetings 
are structured to monitor 
every students' academic progress in reading and 
mathematics and to support teachers in developing lessons that support the learning of the Common 
Core State Standards.
 
 
Professional Development opportunities are scheduled prior to the start of school each year and in January to facilitate desi
gnated cur
riculum 
instructional planning for the teaching staff.
 
 
The focus of our professional development has been on the Common Core State Standards through teachers participation in distr
ict workshops to gain 
an understanding of what students are expected to lea
rn in K
-
12 Mathematics and English Language Arts. Teachers are provided time through 
Professional Learning Community meetings and through release time to plan and develop instruction implementing the new Common
 
Core Standards 
based upon the knowledge obtai
ned through the district workshops.
 
 
Teachers offer support to their colleagues by collaborating on the implementation of the CCSS through PLC meetings with the s
chool principal. 
Assessments are the guide to support student learning which is an ongoing mea
sure of teaching and learning.  MAP testing (Measures of Academic 
Progress) results are compiled at the end of each trimester to help evaluate student progress in grades 2
-
5. Kindergarten and first grade teachers utiltize 
district assessment results at the
 
end of each trimester to measure student growth in reading and mathematics. Every student is assessed in reading 
throughout the school year and students receive targeted guided reading based upon their instructional level.
