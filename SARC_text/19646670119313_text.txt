About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Cond
itions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles Co
unty Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 

, staff lounge, computer lab and 
library. There are 32 classrooms
-
8 permanent and 24 re
-
locatable.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a 
timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A
 
summary of these standards is available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe sc
hool.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no 
longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to maintaining the faciliti
es for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electric
al, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We seek to build positive partnerships with families and the school community. The following 
opportunities for involvement exist at John and Jacquelyn 
Miller School: 
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
Miller School PTO
 

 
Creation of African American Advisory Committee (AAAC) for the 2019
-
20 school year
 
The degree of
 
parent involvement in a child's education contributes to his or her academic achievement and success in school. Parent and co
mmunity 
involvement significantly impacts student achievement. Parent involvement includes parent participation with regard to stu
dents getting the support 
and encouragement they need from home. Parent involvement can be as simple as ensuring your children complete their homework,
 
reading to and 
with your children, signing or providing required documentation, supporting your child's 
on time and daily attendance, responding to communications 
between home and school, or being supportive of disciplinary concerns and attentive to your child's progress in school. Paren
t involvement may also be 
more complex for those who are available to vo
lunteer in classrooms during the school day to provide instructional support or serve on school councils 
such as SSC, ELAC, SAC, or PTO. Parents are encouraged to participate in school
-
sponsored functions such as Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, Coffee 
an


Semester Student Recognition Assemblies, and other Family Day and Night events. Increasing parent involvement, 
parent volunteers, parent leadership, 
parent participation and establishing parent partnerships between home and school are worthy goals for improving student achi
evement at Miller 
Elementary.
