School Description
 
Poinsettia Elementary School is a kindergarten through fifth grade school that serves the
 
southern 
inland population of the Carlsbad Unified School District (CUSD).
 
 
The achievement and performance levels of our students are extremely competitive compared with 
the district averages. Our teachers, support staff, administrators, and parents cont
ribute to this 
academic success through their effective collaboration and continuous dedication to providing 
optimum learning experiences for all students.
 
 
Poinsettia was able to offer Art, Music, Science, and PE classes throughout the school year. There 
were many unique leadership opportunities for students through the yearbook club and Student 
Council.
 
 
Robert Devich, PRINCIPAL
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the 
learning needs of the students in their class, teachers differentiate based on these learning needs 
and they collaborate with grade level team teachers as we
ll as the principal to ensure students 
progress at every level.  Beyond the general education classroom, schools have Learning Center 
support, and depending upon the site, Special Day Classrooms, Guide counseling, and School 
Counselors.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every schoo
l in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local edu
cational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additional
ly, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.
cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Poinsettia Elementary School is a 45,000
-
square
-
foot campus built between 2005 and 2007. It 
consists of six permanent buildings. Four grade
-
level 
complexes, a multipurpose room, a library, and technology lab. The grounds are well maintained and staff ensure the entire ca
mpus is cleaned.
 
 
As a new school, we were attentive to the codes for school 
building and safety. The school is equipped with state
-
of
-
the
-
art technology.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is
 
an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and vent
ilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in g
ood repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs.
 
 
The guidelines for this assessment were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought ab
out by the Williams legislation. 
You can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
Our school is in good repair, according to the criteria established by the Office of Public School Construction. 
Our deficiencies are minor ones resulting 
from common wear and tear, and there are few of them. We scored between 90 and 99 percent on the 15 categories of our evaluat
ion.

comprehensive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, responding, and recovering from possible threats (earthq
uakes, intruders,  fires) to 
ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our coun
selors, psychologists, and site administrators are extensively trained in threat assessment 
techniques by nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessment. To ensure safety on our campus, a school site safety committee conducts 
inspections to iden
tify potential hazards. We have also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire and earthquake drill
s to 
familiarize staff and students with emergency procedures. Our school site is also monitored for physical safety. Play structu
r

landscaping are maintained at a high standard for student safety and undergo regular inspections. A new visitor check
-
in system is being implemented, 
requiring all visitors to sign in and out.
