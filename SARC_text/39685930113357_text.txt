By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About Our School
 
Welcome to Mossdale School 

 
Home of the Jaguars! This i

Card (SARC). As you peruse the document, I hope it will provide you with pertinent information about our school and 
district. If you have further questions or need additional details, please 
feel free to contact me by phone or email.
 
 
Mossdale School strives to create a community atmosphere where a sense of belonging and pride in the school prevails. 
To this end our school vision is as follows: We, the staff of Mossdale School, dedicate oursel
ves to serving our students, 
families, and community in a united, caring, and courageous manner. We believe Mossdale is a school where the Making 
of Success Stories Happens Daily.
 
 
School Description and Mission Statement
 
Mossdale School is one of the newe
st schools in the MUSD. Mossdale opened its doors to students on August 6, 2007, 
with 423 kindergarten through sixth grade students. In our second year, 7th and 8th grade students joined the campus 
and our middle school program was formed. Our enrollment w
as 877 students for the 2014
-
15 year and has grown to a 
population that is currently over 1,050 students. Mossdale School currently maintains a modified traditional school year 
calendar. It is the 20th elementary school in MUSD and joins two other elementa
ry schools in the city of Lathrop. Mossdale 
School has a history that spans back 100 years and two former buildings. According to records, the first school opened in 
an abandoned chicken coop. Twelve children attended the coop school until a new one
-
room s
chool was opened on 
September 10, 1898. This new school attracted 30 students. In 1911, the students were tested and the Mossdale pupils 
received the highest grades in San Joaquin County. The school celebrated 50 years of service to the community in 1948. 
A 
year later the district purchased land and in 1953 a bond was passed and the second Mossdale School was built. In 1966, 
Mossdale joined MUSD, and in 1968 it was closed. We hope to continue the tradition of serving the students in our 
community, accomplis
hing high student achievement, and remembering our history as Mossdale makes its mark in the 
world today!

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education 
population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a
re aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisf
y the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
