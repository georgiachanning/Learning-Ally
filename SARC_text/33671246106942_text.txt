School Description
 
Creekside Elementary School is a diverse, neighborhood school with a capacity of about 540 
students in State Preschool through fifth grade. Creekside's school population reflects 
approximately 76% Hispanic, 18% African American, 5% White, and 1% other. The
re are 20 general 
education classes, 2 special day classrooms and 1 RSP program.  Creekside's student population is 
composed of students from a majority of low to middle income families in which one or both 
parents work. To accommodate this condition, City
 
of Moreno Valley Parks and Recreation and 
Think Together provide an after
-
school program to supervise students and provide homework 
assistance.
 
 
Creekside Elementary utilizes California State Standards to drive our instruction to students. By 
looking at t
he California Standards at each grade level, we are able to build upon the standards and 
add depth within a student's knowledge base. By diligently teaching the standards and utilizing our 
core curriculum, having students work collaboratively, along with u
tilizing DII and other 
instructional strategies we allow students more access to their education and give them the tools 
needed to achieve academically.
 
 
Our mission at Creekside is to provide a learning experience that will enable all students to meet 
or 
exceed the California State Standards and prepare students for career and college readiness. 
We, at Creekside, believe staff, students, and parents must work closely to provide an environment 
of excellence that will enable each student to maximize his/her 
physical, mental, social and 
emotional development.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority
: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We believe that our student achievement and success are based upon a strong school and community partnership. Therefore, Cree
kside Elementary 
School not only encourages parental and community involvement, but also pro
vides a wide variety of activities that allow for direct parental and 
community participation.
 
 
Parents, as members of the Booster Club, enrich the quality of our school climate. Our Booster Club and parent volunteers sup
port and promote the 
following: Red
 
Ribbon Week, school spirit, teacher/class support, assemblies, rewards and incentives, and fifth grade promotion activities.
 
Community involvement includes support from area businesses and civic organizations in academic programs and student recognit
ion a
ctivities. The 
School Site Council (SSC), African American Parent Advisory Committee and English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) also streng
then parent participation 
by providing forums for input on matters such as curriculum, budget, support programs, and
 
special services and needs.
