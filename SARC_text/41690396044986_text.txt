About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementatio
n Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bond to repair, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at Distric
t schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 10 years. A lunch shade 
structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classroom furniture was replaced, exterior painting was complet
ed 
and perimete
r fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at Abbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elem
entary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds
 
on a percentage basis to 
assist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work proj
ects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process throug
h a program called "Akita Box" is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner,
 
the maintenance department 

s to catch up on routine repairs and enhancements.
 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed wit
h one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows t

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Stat
e of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is comp
leted annually for each site. The following school site

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

California Education Code Section 32280 requires school fire evacuation drills, as well as one law enforcement lockdown drill
, and the District organizes 
two District

wide drills each year, using different scenarios that test the Big Five Safety Protocols 
(Shelter in Place, Secure Campus, Drop, Cover and Hold

Professional Development
 
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training 
is available 
through three professional 
development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the
 
implementat
ion of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities
 
integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially 
English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research
 
from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks.
 
Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in language and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards
 
and strategies to support 
conceptual understandin
g and improve student learning.

Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learni
ng communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and smal
l groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed profession
al learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusti
ng our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and feedback surveys) from t
eacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strat
egies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to i
dentify the professional growth causes for student successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then informs the distr

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site 
leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learnin
g 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union repr
esentatives to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy
 
adjustments in the district LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCA
P and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual 
support.
