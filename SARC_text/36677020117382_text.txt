By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Etiwanda Community Day School provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper f
acilities maintenance 
and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities are kept safe, in good working condition, and 
continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together 
to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The teacher, 
custodian, and school 
secretary coordinate efforts to prepare and submit work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations are given 
high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.
 
 
The principal and day custodian communic
ate on a daily, informal basis to discuss campus maintenance and safety 
concerns. The director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss 
maintenance
-
related issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom 
space, equipment, upcoming events, work 
orders (submitted and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct 
a comprehensive inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwar
ded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of facilities. The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report i
dentifies 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.
 
 
Custodial staff are qualified and equipped to handle routine cleaning needs, general maintenance, and minor repairs. 
M&O provides formal training tw
ice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning procedures, and chemical usage. 
One full
-

includes cleaning the staff lounge, stocking st
udent restrooms, and cleaning the cafeteria after meals are served. Every 
morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues that 
require attention before staff and students arrive on campus
. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed immediately. 
Restrooms are checked every hour by campus aides, proctors, custodian, and administrators as a shared, proactive 
measure to keep facilities stocked, safe, and sanitary.
 
 
A professional janitoria
l service is responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 
district office dispatches a team of groundskeepers each week to maintain landscaping and irrigation systems.
 
 
Etiwanda School District participates in the S
tate School Deferred Maintenance Program which provides dollar
-
for
-
dollar 
matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. These 
repairs typically include roofing, plumbing, heating, air co
nditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and 
floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
