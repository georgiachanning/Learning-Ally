Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

As a school, we are
 
implementing the JUSD Units of Study. These teacher created units specifically cover the California 
standards for ELA, Mathematics and Next Generation Science for each grade level. Daily English Language Development 
(ELD) continues to be a key area of foc
us on the West Riverside Elementary campus. Every classroom provides integrated 
and designated ELD curriculum using the current ELD standards. Teachers use district adopted curriculum textbooks to 
support the Units of Study. The Units continue to serve as 
our curriculum however, teachers are given the freedom to use 
appropriate resources to support higher level learning at their discretion.
 
 
 
West Riverside campus modernization recently opened a new Innovation Center developing and implementing District

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa 
Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom t
eachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculu
m frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks 
were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, scien
ce and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  
Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Lib
rary Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education popu
lation and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are a
ligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy th
e requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

West Riverside faculty and staff recognize the importance of ongoing professional development. Rigorous academic 
standards are aligned with materials, professional development and assessments to ensure student academic success. 
The highly qualified staff m
embers collaborate regularly during Wednesday minimum days to support student learning. 
During these curriculum planning and collaboration afternoons, grade
-
level teams use student achievement data and 
formative assessments to examine program effectiveness
 
and instructional practices.  They develop intervention 
strategies in order to provide an exemplary learning environment for all students. From that process, suggestions are 
made for whole school staff development opportunities to ensure academic gains fo
r all students. The weekly 
collaboration afternoons are planned to include grade
-
level and whole staff opportunities for professional growth and 
collaboration.  In addition to Wednesday collaboration, Professional Development is delivered to West Riverside
 
during 
after
-
school workshops, attending conferences and individual mentoring and/or coaching, principal
-
teacher meetings and 
consultants.   Professional Development areas of focus are determined using multiple sources of student achievement 
data and incl
ude: ELA, Early Literacy/DIBELS, I
-
Station, ELD, math, IMPACT Teams,  PBIS, AVID, Technology, Digital 
Citizenship, NGSS Science, Growth Mindset, Step Up To Writing, Student Success Teams, and Safety.
 
 
Grade level teams are provided release days each trimes
ter to analyze data, collaborate and plan specifically with 
interventions and with collaborative teaching focus to assist all students in meeting and exceeding grade level standards 
with a specific focus on English Language Arts, English Language Developme
nt and Mathematics grade level standards.  
During  some of these grade level release days, teachers are provided Professional Development with a consultant which 
provides data
-
driven best practices and curriculum focus for each grade level.
