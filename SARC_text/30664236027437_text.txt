Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the scho
ol, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., tes
t data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (dep
ending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Thomas Jefferson School is located in a densely populated area in the city of Anaheim. The school is surrounded by single 
family homes, condominiums, and apartment buildings. Our dedicated staff educates and supports over 560 students on 
a single track sch
edule. Our Transitional Kindergarten through Sixth grade general education classes are joined by two 
learning handicapped special day classes, Gifted and Talented education classes (grades 3
-
6), and a Korean Dual Language 
Immersion academy.
 
 
 
Thomas Jeffer
son School opened in 1950 with 28 classrooms, a library, and an administration building. Additional 
classrooms were added in 1953, 1958 and 1997. Currently, Jefferson serves Transitional Kindergarten through Sixth grade 
scholars that live in Downtown Anahe
im as well as surrounding neighborhoods through interdistrict transfers.
 
 
Jefferson School is a STEAM school (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, Math) that showcases PLTW (Project Lead 
 
the Way) STEM curriculum, providing an instructional program 
that is rigorous, challenging, and reflects high expectations 
for all students incorporating the 4Cs for global competency (collaboration, communication, creativity, critical thinking). 
Teachers engage in grade level Professional Learning Communities where
 
they analyze student data, collaborate on 
upcoming assessments and best practices, and receive professional development. Teachers are focused on meeting 
students' academic and behavior needs and instruct every day with a focus on enriching the whole child
 
through 
enrichment and activities that promote critical thinkers. Instructional practices are well
-
planned and include engaging and 
interactive activities that are grade level appropriate. Coordinated support services are provided to students who are not 
proficient in order to best meet their needs.
 
 
Vision
 
To equip all Jefferson students to reach their full academic and social potential for success in the 21st Century.
 
 
Mission
 
As a STEAM school, Thomas Jefferson Elementary School empowers 
scholars with the motivation and confidence to lead, 
think critically, and embrace innovation. We promote the life and social skills necessary to successfully navigate our 
dynamic world with an emphasis on
 
 
science, technology, engineering, the arts, and m
ath.

Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 98.92% Overall rating: GOOD
 
 
General: The 
District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the 
District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections t
ake place on a quarterly basis at all sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school 
and efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District
 
maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have highest priority.
 
A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. 
Cl
eaning schedules are developed jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since 

months all schools
 
are being deep cleaned on a rotation schedule.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State 
University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Most recent review date: 12/14/2018
 
 
 
Thomas Jefferson has developed a disaster and school safety plan to protect our students and staff in case of emergency. 
Each year Jefferson School reviews and updates its comprehensive School Safety Plan and forwards a copy to the District's 
Risk Managem
ent Office who then submits the School Safety Plan to the Board of Education for approval. The plan is 
designed in collaboration with both district and city officials. Our practices and procedures are reviewed during monthly 
drills. The school safety plan 
is a public document and will be readily available for inspection at the school and the district 
office.
