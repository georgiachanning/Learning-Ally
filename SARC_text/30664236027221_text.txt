Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
This section provides information about the school, its programs and its goals.
 
The mission at Lincoln Elementary School is to empower all students to be motivated, engaged, and responsible for thei
r 
academic achievement. Strong commitment to high expectations, collaboration, and using best practices ensure that all 
students will learn and meet grade level standards. The Lincoln staff is committed to building and nurturing partnerships 
with all stake
holders to help every student reach full potential and become contributing members in society.
 
 
The school
-
wide instructional focus has been to move students to think deeply, differentiate in small group instruction, 
and engage in academic discourse. Teach
ers continue to participate in professional development opportunities that 
target the aforementioned focus areas. Teachers have been trained to use Thinking Maps in all areas of the curriculum. 
Thinking Maps help build critical thinking skills and facilita
te how students understand and apply new knowledge. In 
addition, school
-
wide designated and integrated English Language Development continues to be a focal point 
throughout the instructional day.
 
 
All teachers are fully credentialed and have obtained CLAD 
or BCLAD certification, enabling them to provide appropriate 
instruction to our English Learner (EL) students. EL students receive instruction at their ELD level during a specified 
period in the day and teachers use SDAIE strategies to support access to th
e core curriculum.
 
 
 
Lincoln offers a GATE cluster program for identified GATE students in 3rd
-
6th grade. Lincoln has established a Response 
to Intervention process that identifies struggling students and provides intervention as early as possible for them
. At
-
risk 
students are identified and referred to the Student Success Team. Students identified for special education have 
Individualized Educational Plans and are supported by the Resource Specialist Program and the regular education 
teacher. Two special 
day classes provide placement for students with mild
-
moderate disabilities. Lincoln school also 
provides a Dual Language Immersion program, Kindergarten through 6th grade. The goal of this program is to develop 
academic proficiency and literacy in two lang
uages, Spanish and English, while cultivating an understanding and 
appreciation of diverse cultures. Students in this program receive standards based instruction in both languages with the 
goal of achieving the Seal of Biliteracy.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Inspection Date: 09/27/2019
 
 
Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 98.68% Overall rating: GOOD
 
 
General: The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this
 
effort, the 
District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of the s
chool 
and efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergency rep
air needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. 
Cleaning schedules are developed jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and sa
fe school. Since 

months all schools are being deep cleaned on a rotation schedule.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASP
P] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eig
ht and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant 
cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or 
programs 
of study.

coaching framework and maximize individual
ized professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
