School Description
 
Independent Elementary School, located in Castro Valley, 
serves students from diverse 
backgrounds, demonstrating an array of races, religions, languages, and socioeconomic statuses. 
Students come from families that range from multi
-
generational Castro Valley residents to recently 
arrived immigrants. This diversi
ty requires teachers, staff, and administrators to respond with 
flexibility and grace, creating a positive and welcoming environment where parents/guardians feel 
comfortable providing input and donating time. The Independent community strives to create an 
environment that fosters the development of all students, allowing them to grow into their own 
unique and inspirational selves.
 
 
With collaboration as the backbone of Independent, same grade level classrooms mirror each other 
with high expectations in all 
content areas based on relevant standards, including English Language 
Arts, Math, Science, Social Studies, the Arts, Physical Education, and Social/Emotional/Behavioral 
education. The unique personalities of each classroom shine through with the focus on c
reating 
opportunities for student agency and a highlight of student strengths. This universal level of 
instruction is done with high quality curriculum of both hard and digital formats, and is supported 
by the expertise of teachers on the Instructional Lea
dership Team (ILT). The ILT plays an active and 
important role on all key school decisions through data review and action planning.  The ILT also 
leads the professional learning work of their respective grade levels during and outside of their 
dedicated si
x hours of professional development each month.
 
 
In addition to the robust curriculum and instruction provided during the school day, Independent 
offers a number of after school supports and experiences for students. Families can choose from 
activities ran
ging from language, drama, and meditation classes to intensive academic tutoring and 
extensions. These programs are due to the strong community partnerships that the Independent 
staff create and their creative solutions to barriers including transportation
 
and finance.
 
 
The success of Independent would not be possible without the partnership of the parent 
community. The Parent Teacher Association, School Site Council, and other parent committees 
ensure that all stakeholders receive the information, support,
 
and guidance necessary to take full 
advantage of Independent programming. They are active at the school, district, and community 
levels, keeping Independent connected and engaged.
 
 
Vision:
 
Independent Elementary School fosters the development of all stude
nts, encouraging them to grow 
into their unique and inspirational selves. Students transition to middle schools as emotionally 
literate, intellectually curious, academically capable, and socially conscious problem
-
solvers who 
have an appreciation and curio
sity for difference and the skills necessary to achieve their goals.
 
 
Mission:
 
In partnership with the community, Independent Elementary School educates students in a safe, 
supportive, positive, and welcoming learning environment where they are immersed in
 
a well
-
rounded and rigorous curriculum with an emphasis on the whole child and their social/emotional 
learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Independent Elementary School is located in the town of Castro Valley, a beautiful com
munity of rolling hills and canyons with mild winters and pleasant 
summers. Across the bay from San Francisco and just south of the city of Oakland, Castro Valley is a growing and a richly div
erse community with 
neighborly appeal.
 
 
Independent Elementary S
chool was built in 1953. All of the playing fields at Independent Elementary have been renovated and the playground and 
equipment in the kindergarten area have been updated. A new retaining wall has created a natural amphitheater in which perfor
mances and 
school 
assemblies are enjoyed. Mechanical ventilation has been added to seven classrooms. In 2016, voters approved Measure G which w
ill bring many 
improvements to the campus. The custodial/grounds staff of two maintains clean and safe facilities. District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used 
to ensure efficient service 
and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
