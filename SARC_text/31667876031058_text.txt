Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Auburn Union Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 13, 2017, and determined that each school 
within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant 
to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Language Learners (ELL), are given
 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom an
d to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the 
California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials 
approved for use by the state are revi
ewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a 
selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent 
examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displ
ays information (as of December 2016) about the 
quality, currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Rock Creek Elementary
 
School. The school is in compliance with 
all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety 
plan was last reviewed and updated in the Winter of 2020 by the School Site Council. All rev
isions were communicated to 

staff safety during a disaster. Fire, Earthquake, Shelter in Place, and Lockdown drills are conducted on
 
a regular basis 
throughout the school year. The entire campus is surrounded by fencing, and all gates are locked to outsiders throughout 
the school day.  Signs posted in English and Spanish remind all visitors of the requirement to sign in at the main off
ice and 
obtain a visitor pass prior to entering campus, a policy closely monitored by staff. Supervision staff are assigned to the 
playground to supervise students during all recess breaks. Additional staff monitors the entrances and exits before and 
after
 
school, and the car and bus loading and unloading zones.  A crossing guard assists students and families that cross 
Education Street before and after school.

Opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the district and individual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff. The district offers three staff development days annually 
(August, 
October/November, and January), during which certificated staff members are offered professional growth opportunities 
in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Our areas of focus during the 2018
-
19 school year are foundational 
readin
g skills, curriculum development, direct instruction, and differentiated instruction.  Areas of learning during 
structured Professional Development days are revisited and emphasized during staff meetings, Professional Learning 
Community (PLC) meetings, and
 
District Grade
-
Level meetings. Two district Instructional Coaches support teachers' 
implementation of Professional Learning in and out of the classroom via model lessons, co
-
teaching, co
-
planning, and co
-
interpretation of student progress data.
