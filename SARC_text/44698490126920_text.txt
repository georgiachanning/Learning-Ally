Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The California Kindergarten Readiness Act of 2010 offers children not yet 5 year
s old when Kindergarten begins, whose 
birthdays fall between September and December, a preparation year ("Transitional Kindergarten") using a 
developmentally appropriate curriculum designed to prepare them for a successful Kindergarten and school experienc
e.
 
 
Soquel Union Elementary School District has created an educational environment at Opal Cliffs School that enhances the 
Capitola Community in providing an outstanding learning environment for children of preschool age through transitional 
kindergarten. 
Campus Kids Connection operates the child care and preschool program, and Santa Cruz Gardens 
Elementary oversees the two
-
classroom TK program. Soquel School District's transitional kindergarten students are given 
a wonderful opportunity to learn in a nurtu
ring and age
-
appropriate environment. Our transitional kinders are prepared 
for a regular kindergarten program through transitional kindergarten activities and academic programs.
 
 
Opal Cliffs School was designed by Weston Miles Architects and constructed b
y Pencon Construction in 2012 to provide 
the most up
-
to
-
date approach for school design. Operable solar
-
efficient windows provide natural light and views to the 
site as well as natural ventilation. The building was constructed using Insulated Concrete Wall
s (ICF). ICF walls are used for 
strength, durability, energy efficiency, acoustical attenuation, and safety.
 
 
An added unique design of Opal Cliffs School is that this site uses rain gardens to collect storm water run
-
off for percolation 
into the aquifers,
 
native plants, low flow and drip irrigation, and trees that shade the site during the summer and allow 
the sun in during the winter. A garden area is allocated for students to grow their own vegetables and the play areas are 
designed to encourage creative
 
play.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which
 
data were collected:
 
2019 December
 
 
District wide, texts are adopted from the State of California approved list of texts adopted by the State Board of Education.
 
And while Transitional Kindergarten (TK) is not designed to master kindergarten grade level s
tandards, exposure to these 
standards, as well as pre
-
school foundations, is the district's  academic baseline. As such, Kindergarten materials may be 
used in the TK setting, but not required by school board adoption processes.
 
 
At the elementary level the
 
adopted texts are: Language Arts
--
Reader's and Writers Workshop, Mathematics

Pearson 
Investigations adopted in 2015; Social Studies

Scotts Foresman Social Studies; Science

Scott Foresman (4th and 5th 
grade) and DELTA FOSS Science.(K
-
3rd grade). In additio

supplement the curriculum.
 
 
At the Middle School College Preparatory Mathematics, CPM was adopted for the 2016
-
2017 school year. The science 
department is adapting materials to begin implementation of 
NGSS. The Humanitties Department is also looking into 
materials to pilot while using onine materials from the Achieve the Core, supplemental materials and textbook.
 
 
Sufficient standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials are available for
 
each pupil, including English 
learners. These texts are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum frameworks adopted by the State Board 
of Education in the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history
-
so
cial science, as 
appropriate.
 
 
All students have sufficient texts for class work and homework

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide asse
ssments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English
 
language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with
 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and th
e California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school district 
is a small district with approximately 2,000 students.  Therefore, all schools are covered by a district 
wide Safe Schools Plan. This plan stresses emergency preparation and was developed in conjunction with law enforcement 
and county emergency services.  
All buildings housing students meet Field Act standards.  The Fire Department and the 
district inspect facilities annually.

Over the past three years our district has spent a great deal of professional learning on positive behavior intervention 
support (PBIS), social emotional academic development 
(SEAD), and multi
-
tiered systems of support (MTSS). In 2016
-
2017, 
district administration including the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, Director of Student 
Services and two principals participated in eight days of implemen
tation training for Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports, 
MTSS.  From this professional development, and through a specialized grant, the district is participating in a second year 
of PBIS support at two schools, Soquel and Santa Cruz Gardens Elementary Schools
. Leadership teams from each of these 
site are comprised of the principal, teachers, campus supervisors and parents. These teams are in initial implementation 
and data collection phases. PBIS is the continued work at each school site, as is SEAD, which inc
lude alternative means of 
correction, RULER, mindfulness, classroom charters and more.
