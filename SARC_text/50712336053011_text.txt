School Description
 
Roberts Ferry Elementary School has distinguished itself for its nurturing and supportive 
environment and academic achievement. This small, rural school has a tradition of pride in serving 

 
 
Challenges in the coming y
ear include maintaining and improving upon this tradition of student 
learning in a supportive environment. A charter school has been established in the district in an 

pleted 
last year and is at the State Department for funding. The district sees a need for a 
gymnasium/cafeteria as the district has grown by 30% since 2016.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California 
public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are 
required to pre
pare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact 
the 
school principal or the district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district makes a great effort to ensure our school is clean, safe and functional. T
o assist in the effort, the district uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School construction, in keeping with the Williams Legislation of 2004. 
This instrument provides 
specific information on the conditi
on of the school and the efforts made to ensure our students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning 
environment.
 
 
On a quarterly basis, the district submits a Williams Settlement Uniform Complaint Report to the County Office of Education.
 
To this date, no facilities 
complaint has ever been filed with the district. Roberts Ferry School has eight classrooms, a multipurpose room, cafeteria an
d administrative office. The 
school opened in 1919 in a schoolhouse that was replaced with a new build
ing in 1976. An additional building was constructed in 1986. Two portable 
classrooms were constructed in 1996. In 2012 a major new building project was completed and includes a new library and three 
added classrooms and 
storage. District maintenance staff 
ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. 
A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The principal 
works with the 
custodian to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expend
itures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. These facilities were brough
t up
-
to
-
date in 2011.
 
 
Architectural planning and construction of a new building was completed in 2012
-
2013. The building consists of an auxiliary classrooms, and storage 
area.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
