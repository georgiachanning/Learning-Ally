About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety and well
-
being is promoted by activities includi
ng emergency and earthquake preparedness drills, bus evacuation drills, playground 
supervision, drug and alcohol abuse prevention education programs, child abuse awareness, a Peace Patrol, and a School Safety
 
Patrol. The school safety 
committee reviews saf
ety policies, practices and procedures yearly. The physical arrangement of the classrooms and facilities allow for uninterrup
ted 
learning time while facilitating the safe movement of students throughout the learning environment. Students participate with
 
s
taff and parents in 
reviewing the procedures and make recommendations for modifications throughout the year. Students are trained in conflict res
olution and supported 
in solving problems before they escalate. This process has significantly reduced the numb
er of referrals to the office. The safety of our children is a high 
priority at Juarez
-
Lincoln, and we are committed to presenting positive role models for students so they will aspire to the highest ideals possi
ble. The 
School Site Council approved the Sc
hool Safety Plan on September 2019. Elements of the School Safety Plan: Each teacher is responsible for a specific 
task related to safety of all students. All visitors are required to check into the front office and receive a pass to be on 
campus. A safety
 
committee 
monitors and updates the plan. The San Diego Police Department is involved in monitoring the safety of the school and reviewi
ng the plan.
