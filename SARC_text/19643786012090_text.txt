Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 

 
 
The Charter Oak Unified School District Board and Superintendent visit the c
ampus regularly and are updated by the 
principal on school safety, the environment, and facilities. The Board and district staff use this information to plan for 
future improvements and upgrades to the Glen Oak campus. Our Learning Resource Center with lib
rary and technology 
infrastructure was added to our campus.  Internet infrastructure was greatly enhanced, all school buildings underwent 
restoration with paint and wood/stucco repair, and a shade structure and benches were added to our playground.
 
 
The Glen Oak School Safety Committee meets regularly and makes safety inspections of the campus. The custodial crew 
examines our school grounds and facilities daily, reporting on and promptly addressing any hazards. The playground 
perimeter is securely fen
ced and locked during school hours. Cleaning solvents and other toxic materials on campus are 
kept in securely locked facilities when not in use. Insect control is applied after school hours and notices are posted with 
information regarding materials and u
se.

positive behavior on campus
 
 
The District and the Glen Oak staff continue to respond to
 
the needs of all students by evaluating and upgrading methods 
of assessment and instruction to maximize student achievement. The professional development plan for our staff is based 
on identified areas of student need utilizing SBAC results, i
-
Ready data,
 
and other grade
-
level assessment tools.
 
 
The staff minimum days (ten per year), staff meetings, grade
-
level meetings, district training, and other professional 
development opportunities are utilized for continuing education in the instruction of core 
curriculum, assessment of 
student achievement, and meeting the academic and health and safety needs of students.
 
 
Teachers write professional and personal goals based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP). 
Teacher evaluations and o
bservations are based on the CSTP and teachers collaborate with the administrator to reflect 
on areas of growth and strength. Staff development is evaluated to ensure it is meeting the needs of teachers and 
students. Teachers give input as to their profess
ional needs and this data is used to develop professional development 
activities at both the district and site level.
