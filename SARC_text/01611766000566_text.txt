School Description
 
Cabrillo Elementary is a small learning community with a culture of caring and collaboration.  
Cabrillo's teachers and support staff hold high expectations for students, and implement standards
-
based i
nstruction. Teachers provide differentiated activities throughout the school day to ensure 
that all students succeed. In the science lab, students participate in engaging hands
-
on and inquiry
-
based instruction. The physical education specialist implements 
an engaging standards
-
based 
curriculum that directly involves students in the analysis of their health portfolio. The computer 
specialist develops and refines the skill set students will need to fully take advantage of the G Suite 
for Education set of coll
aborative tools (formerly known as GAFE) while following the district
-
adopted technology standards.
 
 
Cabrillo is a leader in technology with a 2:1 ratio of students to web
-
enabled device. Students have 
daily access to Chromebooks in the classroom 
where two teachers share a single Chromebook cart 
filled with a class set of chromebooks. This level of on
-
demand access allows teachers to fully 
integrate the G Suite for Education tools providing opportunities for student collaboration that 
extend and en
rich learning opportunities. Students build foundational reading skills through daily 
use of Lexia, as well as refine their math skills with Mathletics. With this unprecedented level of 
access, Cabrillo teachers are able to provide targeted interventions f
or students based on their 
performance on the various web applications. In addition, teachers are able to accurately level their 
students for the intervention block with easyCBM, and demonstrate growth over time.
 
 
The Cabrillo staff collaborates during the
ir scheduled grade level meetings during early
-
release 
Wednesdays. Teachers work in grade
-
level teams with the priority standards breaking them into 

essential ques
tions of what should be taught and how should it be assessed.
 
 
CABRILLO MISSION STATEMENT

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Conten
t Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cabrillo Elementary was built in 1965. During the summer of 2005, the district used funds from a Health and Safety Bond measu
re to make the following 
repairs to Cabrillo Elementary. It 
replaced the existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system with new rooftop HVAC units and 
performed voluntary seismic upgrades.  The main buildings will have structural upgrades to make it safer during an earthquake
. The roof was repla
ced, 
and the restrooms that were not remodeled in 2000 were remodeled to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act code. The existi
ng PG&E electrical 
service was replaced with a larger service to better serve the school, and a new fire alarm system was inst
alled.  New double
-
keyed locksets that can be 
locked from the inside were installed on classroom doors.  Emergency lights were installed at interior assembly areas, and ne
w exterior lighting was 
added for safety.  During the summer of 2007 construction was
 
completed at the school, reconfiguring parking lots for student and staff safety and adding 
more staff parking spaces.
 
 
Cabrillo Elementary primary buildings measure 38,882 square feet, while the auxiliary buildings measure 1,200 square feet.  W
e have two
 
full
-
time 
custodians who care for the facility.  With thorough scheduling and thoughtful planning, we maximize the use of our facilitie
s and have numerous activities 
planned for each day.  The school is cleaned each night and inspected each morning.  The 
district maintenance staff work very hard to ensure that repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good condition and working order are completed in a timely manner.  They use a work order pri
ority process to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repai
rs are given the highest priority.  An annual safety check is conducted in each room.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection
 

 
on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that
 
time, those conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System
, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of

School Safety Plan
 
Cabrillo's staff collaborates with parents, students, and community agencies to create a safe and orderly learning environmen

committee meets regularly to identify 
safety concerns, and to update the school's Safety Plan annually.  Cabrillo's Safety Plan was revised March 2019. 
The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, child abuse reporting, student discipline and inventories of emerg
ency supplies.  W
e make 
the plan available for our School Site Council and Safety Committee and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the p
lan with all staff during a 
school wide staff meeting. Throughout the year, staff practices procedures with their students a
t school wide drills that include fire, earthquake, search 
and rescue (disaster) and evacuation.
 
 
Certificated staff and noon supervisors supervise students on the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school, as w
ell as at all recesses and at 
lun
chtime. The principal and staff regularly review expectations with students for personal conduct. The school
-
wide character education program, 
Project Heart, Head, Hands (H3), helps us encourage traits that are expected of all Cabrillo students.   This cha
racter education program is being 
implemented in all of our classrooms.  Primary students receive weekly awards for practicing character education and intermed
iate students receive 
monthly awards for academics, behavior, and demonstrating improvement.

Professional Development provided f
or Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional dev
elopment:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
