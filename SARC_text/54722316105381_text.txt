About the SARC
 
By Februar
y 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding
 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and
 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school has a Safe School Plan that is in place and updated yearly by the School Safety Committee, an offshoot of the Scho
ol Site Council. Evacuation 
drills are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that staff and students know what to do in an emergen
cy. A Cal
-
OSHA representative attends monthly 
meetings and provides updates to staff on safety and health issues. In addition to these programs, adequate supervision is pr
ovided before school, during 
break/recess, at lunch, and after school.
 
 
Supervision i

 
 
All school district facilities are supportive of teaching and learning. Classrooms are clean and orderly and provide a safe l
earning environment reflective 
of student work and current curriculum. We have a school caf
eteria that provides students with a breakfast and lunch program and is used as a 
multipurpose facility for large
-
scale programs and meetings. The school library provides students with supplemental reading materials and provides 
additional educational reso
urces. The school grounds are kept clean and well maintained for student play, recreation, and athletic activities.
 
 
We take pride in our well
-
maintained buildings and landscaping. The Tulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a s
afe and clean 
environment throughout the school year. Students, staff, and parents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter fre
e.
 
 
The Tulare City School District provides ongoing maintenance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and
 
portable buildings to guarantee all 
schools in the district are in good working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for pupils are main

and meet local hygiene standards generally applicable to pubic f
acilities, including operational toilets and sinks in all restrooms. The district has 
established a facilities inspection system to ensure that all school buildings meet the standards listed above.
 
 
The school grounds, buildings, and restrooms are kept cle
an, safe, and regularly maintained. We have a morning custodian from 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. 
and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. Custodians are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building princi
pal and a director of 
custodians to mak
e sure that the school is safely maintained and cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, the district has a ge
neral 
maintenance crew that takes care of the more technical repairs (plumbing, heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, paint
ing, and/or major repairs). At 

urces. Repairs are made on 
an ongoing basis, and the district has a work order repair procedure that
 
begins with the school principal referring needed repairs that cannot be taken 
care of by the site custodians to the district superintendent. The superintendent assigns the repairs to the maintenance dire
ctor who, in turn, assigns the 
work out to the diff
erent maintenance specialists. Work orders are completed in a timely manner. We also have a school site safety representative
 
who 

a
sis with the district 
superintendent to discuss questions or concerns.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);
