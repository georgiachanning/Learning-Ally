School Description
 
Pacific Rim Elementary School is a kindergarten through fifth grade school that serves 
the southern 
coastal population of the Carlsbad Unified School District. The 2013

2014 school year was our 
fifteenth year of operation. The achievement and performance levels of our students are extremely 
competitive compared with the district averages. Ou
r teachers, support staff, administrators, and 
parents contribute to this academic success through their effective collaboration and ongoing 
dedication to providing optimum learning experiences.
 
 
We encourage you to join us in celebrating the high academic
 
achievement of our students. At 
Pacific Rim, our focus is on ensuring that each student demonstrates significant academic progress, 

confident in the ability to learn.
 
Our home
-
to
-
school communication system with parents has been 
solidified through the school Web site, daily planners, weekly school news articles, PTO 
newsletters, and our automated phone system.
 
 
Richard Tubbs, PRINCIPAL
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the 
learning needs of the students in their class, teachers differentiate based on these learning needs 
and they collaborate with grade level team teachers as we
ll as the principal to ensure students 
progress at every level.  Beyond the general education classroom, Pacific Rim has Learning Center 
support,  Guide counseling, and a school psychologist three days a week.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every scho
ol in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local ed
ucational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additiona
lly, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www
.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents provide great assistance with the stud
ent awards and recognition assemblies, Science Day, teacher mini
-
grants, movie night, our monthly 

h and science materials; 
and assi
st with school gardens, school beautification, and fund
-
raisers. Our important parent groups, previously known as Friends of Pacific Rim and the 
PTA have now combined to form Friends fo Pacific Rim PTO. For the 16th year, parents assisted with our school p
rograms by contributing more than  
20,000 hours of volunteer time (a $160,000 resource available at no cost to the school). For information about volunteer oppo
rtunities at our school, 
please call our school office at (760) 331

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
We revise and update our school safety plan each ye
ar in the fall. Our current school safety plan meets all federal, state, and district standards for a 
comprehensive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, responding, and recovering from possible threats (earthq
uakes, intruders,  fires) to 
ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our counselors, psychologists, and site administrators are extensively tr
ained in threat assessment 
techniques by nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessment. To ensure safety on our campus,
 
a school site safety committee conducts 
inspections to identify potential hazards. We have also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire a
nd earthquake drills to 
familiarize staff and students with emergency procedures. Our scho

landscaping are maintained at a high standard for student safety and undergo regular inspections. A new visitor check
-
in system is being implemented, 
requiring all 
visitors to sign in and out.
