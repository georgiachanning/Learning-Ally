By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Kazuo Masuda Middle School, located in Fountain Valley, California is home to a diverse population of approximately 800 
students in grades 6
-
8.  Our diverse student population makes for a rich campus culture.  Another admirable quality found 
at Masuda is s
trong community involvement. We offer many opportunities for parents and community members alike to 
become involved on a regular basis and support the partnership between the home and school connection.
 
 
Masuda is a 2009 and 2019 California Distinguished S
chool, as well as a 2015 California Gold Ribbon School. We are 
fortunate to have a staff of 30+ teachers who are dedicated to the education of our students.  Our goal is to focus on 
increasing student achievement through a highly academic, standards
-
based 
instructional program, while at the same 
time, providing a highly enriched educational and social environment for our middle school students. Masuda Middle 
School is committed to providing a safe, supportive learning environment which promotes academic exc
ellence through 
the mastery of basic skills while challenging students to become life
-
long learners and to reach their highest potential.  
Students at Masuda, guided by a team of knowledgeable, highly
-
trained teachers, administrators, and parents, will 
bec
ome effective communicators and creative thinkers who will be successful and responsible citizens.
 
 
The Masuda staff spends a great deal of time planning for each school year with the intent of making a positive and 
successful educational experience for al
l students.  In addition, we recognize the importance of a home
-
school partnership 
as a necessary component to ensure the success of our Masuda students.  We highly encourage our parents to assist their 
children by monitoring their daily progress and becom
ing actively involved in their child's education.  Parental involvement 
and support are key ingredients to making Masuda Middle School one of the finest schools in Orange County.

aligned textbooks or instructional 
materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional m
aterials 
used within the District are aligned with the California State Standards and Frameworks and have been approved by the

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Masuda Middle School was originally constructed in 1975 and was modernized in 2006. The campus is currently comprised 
of 32 classrooms, a library, a home economics class, a wood shop, and a spacious playground. During the 2018
-
19 school 
year, additional re
novations were made to the Masuda campus including the installation of air conditioning and touch
-
screen displays in multiple classrooms, with plans to expand campus
-
wide.  The campus also features four new state
-
of
-
the
-
art STEM classrooms that were comple
ted in October, 2019.  The facility supports teaching and learning through its 
ample classroom and recreational space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 

f 
Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps ke
ep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

Maintenance & Repair:
 
A routine maintenance program is admini

complex maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the Fountain Valley School District's Maintenan
ce & Operations Department to ensure that school 
grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate 
attention. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are compl
eted efficiently and in the order in 
which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley Sc
hool District did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional, much
-
nee
ded funds for these types of projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

on student achievement.  Three student
-
free days are reserved throughout the school year for 
the purpose of providing 
district
-
wide staff development for teachers and classified staff. In addition, teachers attend numerous content
-
area 
specific training sessions either before, during, or after the school day throughout the school year.  Recent pro
fessional
