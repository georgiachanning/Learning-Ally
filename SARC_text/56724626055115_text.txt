By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sunkist School was founded in 1959. The school is located in the city of Port Hueneme, Califo
rnia and is one of eleven 
schools in the Hueneme Elementary School District. Sunkist School, a TK/Kinder through 5th grade school, is a learning 
community of students, families, highly qualified professionals, and the neighboring public. We are committed t
o 
providing a complete education with a focus on College and Career Readiness and implementing integrated units for 
students to learn the California Common Core State Standards.  We also work to meet the cultural, social and emotional 
needs of all students
 
as we prepare them to lead effective, responsible and meaningful lives.
 
 
As a neighborhood school, we are fortunate to have strong community support.  Motivated and dedicated employees and 
volunteers work together to develop the intellectual, physical, so
cial and emotional potential of each student.
 
 
The week before school started, Sunkist offered two engaging events:  1.  A week of Kinder Readines Camp, this helped 
our new students to become acclimated to the students future "home" during the school day a
nd 2.  Pre
-
Back to School 
Night, families could come for two hours  and meet their teachers.  This was for new and returning families.
 
 
Working in partnership with other educators in the Hueneme Elementary School District, we are able to offer after school
 
academic, enrichment and recreation classes to students. In addition, we conduct Kaiser Permanente Assemblies, 
Response to Intervention Parent nights, Parent Education Nights; known as Loving Solutions and English Language 
Development Parent Nights.  Each
 
grade level is asked to include at least one "Opening Doors" event every year:  Art Show 
event, Art Trek Parent Night, SPARKS Parent Day are just a few of the "Opening Doors" events, Car Show event,  This is 
our second year of including every morning for 
parents to come on campus to exercise, dance or walk the track with their 
children.  Our school is also one of five schools implementing the "Circle of Friends" club, to help students better adjust 
to meeting new people.  The month of March, we do daily ev
ents to promote Kindness as well as each class wrote at the 
beginning of the year "What Kindess Looks Like at Sunkist" books.  This was a way to build school community in each of 
the classrooms.  We also work in collaboration with our local colleges and co
mmunity leaders to have a College and Career 
Fair every April.  Students in grades 4 and 5 rotate to two colleges and three careers to have an understanding of the 
future can hold for our students.
 
 
Sunkist is working on integrated lessons with our new Won
ders implementation.  Data/Collaboration days are used to 
help grade levels design lessons that incorporate all areas of academia as well as the social emotional piece for our 
students learning.
 
 
Sunkist has added two new components to helping our students
 
be the best they can be: 1.  Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Support (MTSS).  In this area we have a committee of teachers, classified and administrators to help look at three areas: 
academics, behavior and social and emotional well being of our students.  It is a
 
3 tier pyramid that we are working on to 
pertain to our Sunkist students.  2. 5th grade teachers have added Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID).  This 
is designed to help students with the College and Career awareness as well as organizational
 
skills.
 
 

responsibility through a balanced learning program.  They will THRIVE as we foster perseverance and resiliency in a safe, 
cultu
rally responsive, and inclusive community.  We will EMPOWER our students by teaching them critical thinking skills 
through a rigorous academic experience in a digitally
-
rich environment.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sunkist students and 
parents are notified yearly regarding the school
-
wide discipline plan, included in the folder of 
information sent home to parents. In an effort to ensure a safe and secure campus, parents and other visitors are required 
to check in at the school office and
 
get a badge to wear while on campus.
 
 
Campus gates are locked after school begins each morning and are re
-
opened before dismissal time.  We have paid campus 
assistance that supervise the students while on campus, prior to the first bell ringing.
 
 
Parents 
are reminded to follow established traffic regulations when dropping off or picking up their children.
 
 
First aid kits, red backpacks and fire extinguishers are in place and ready for emergency use.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was reviewed and updated in 
February 15, 2019 and was discussed with staff May 22, 2019 as well 
as November 19, 2019.
 
 
Every teacher on campus has a phone in their room as well as a walkie talkie.  The walkie talkies are used for whenever 
the teachers leaves the room with their class
 
they are expected to carry it with them.
 
 
Sunkist also has regular drills for the safety of our students: lockdown, fire drill, earthquake drills, and shelter in place
.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff 
Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals participate in professional development focused on the California 
Common Core State Standards in order to improve their skills in teaching and assessment of student 
learning. The primary 
focus areas are instruction of grade
-
level content standards, intervention strategies for students who have not mastered 
standards, and assessment of student progress. 
 
 
The primary area of focus for the most recent three
-
year period 
was:
 

 
English Language Arts
 

 
English Language Development
 

 
Writing
 

 
Mathematics
 

 
C.H.A.M.P.S. Program (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, Successful Students)
 
Professional development is offered during the teaching day, on three student
-
free
 
staff development days, during 
summer institutes, after school, and on weekends. Substitute teachers are provided and the negotiated hourly rate is 
offered for attendance.
 
 
During the school year, teachers are supported by classroom observations, staff me
etings, and grade
-
level/content area 
collaboration. Professional learning agendas are based on student achievement data and teacher input. In 
reading/language arts and mathematics, student performance data is ongoing and evaluated using a common assessment
. 
A Student Progress Report aligned to the California Common Core State Standards is sent to parents at the end of each 
trimester.
