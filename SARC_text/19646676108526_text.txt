School Description
 
LAVA is made up of three small learning communities: TK
-
2 Home Education, 3
-
8 Virtual Academy, 
and TK
-
8 Home Hospital Program.  Our mission is to provide educational pathways for all students, 
all of the time.  Our vision is to build self
-
driven learners, 
and help students learn how to advocate 
for their learning needs.
 
 
The Home Education, Lancaster Alternative Virtual Academy (LAVA) and Home Hospital staff work 
closely with students and their families to find options and excellence in education.  Our team
 
of 
educators work together to serve those who will benefit from an alternative school setting.
 
 
The TK
-
2nd Home Education Program gives families the support and curriculum they need to 
deliver instruction in the method that best meets the needs of their c
hild.  The teacher reviews the 
content with the parents/guardians to help them understand the concept and best way to deliver 
the information.  The areas of study are English, Math, Social Sciences, Science, Physical Education, 
Health, and VAPA. The teache

ensure the state standards are being met.  We also offer workshops for students on campus in ELA, 
Math, and Music at least once per week.
 
 
LAVA is a 3rd
-
8th blended learning, blended teac
hing program.  We strive to meet the unique 
educational needs of each student to attain their full potential through an innovative, project
-
based, technology
-
rich environment. LAVA offers students a flexible learning environment 
supported by credentialed t
eachers who provide face
-
to
-
face small group instruction and online 
feedback and support.  The majority of the work is done independently using an online 
teaching/learning platform.  The teachers provide hands
-
on learning sessions four days a week.  A 
musi
c teacher provides sessions on the fifth day related to music literacy.  These workshop are an 
opportunity for students to socialize, work collaboratively, and experience hands
-
on learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed b
y the Los Angeles County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the distric
t office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
LAVA is adjacent to the Sunnydale Elementary School campus. Six portable buildings house the front/prin
cipal's office and 4 classrooms as well as a 
combined student/staff lounge with restrooms.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely m
anner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary
 
of these standards is available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe sc
hool.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Project
 
A flag pole was installed in 2019.  A marquee and landscaping will be added 
to the campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
