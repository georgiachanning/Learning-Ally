School Description
 
Ramona Elementary School is located on the East side of 
Oxnard, where the population is 
predominantly of Latino/Hispanic descent with a significant immigrant population. Our school is 
comprised of 99% Latino, 1% white, 98.3% socioeconomically disadvantaged, and 85.4% English 
Learners. Among the English Language
 
Learners, we have dialects such as Mixtec and Zapotec, 
which comprise 8.85 percent of the English Language Learners. Although the odds are against our 
students, Ramona Staff made a commitment to our students, and through collective efficacy, we 
had signif
icant gains on our English Language Arts CAASPP. Overall, we had a four percent 
improvement in grades three through five. In addition, our longitudinal data showed fifth
-
grade 

lective efficacy, 
students had the support of Lexia CORE5, which enriches the academic instruction and reinforces 
learning in an adaptive personalized and individualized learning that motivates students by their 
success creating a customized and personaliz
ed learning path. Lexia Core5 provides a systematic 
and structured approach to six critical areas of reading; phonological awareness, phonics, structural 
analysis, automaticity/fluency vocabulary, and comprehension. ST
-
Math starts by teaching the 
foundatio
nal concepts visually and then connects the ideas to the symbols and language. ST Math 
is a standards
-
aligned program that creates opportunities to move away from digitized math drills 
and puts them in the mindset to think creatively. Challenging games hel
p students explore non
-
routine problems and build numbers sense instead of memorizing disconnected facts. Both Lexia 
and ST Math programs create personalized learning paths for students of all abilities through 
adaptive placement and scaffold activities th
at align with rigorous standards. Lastly, we believe we 
need to develop lifelong learners where every student can explore the world through reading, 
therefore at Ramona, we celebrate every child's success by acknowledging their reading success 
through the 
Accelerated Reading Program. 
 
 
With our Mission, Vision, and Commitment in mind, we at Ramona Elementary School work 
consistently and diligently improve upon our strong gains in student achievement. Hard work and 
dedication to our goals have shown an 
increase in student achievement, especially in the area of 
Language Arts, mathematics and with our English Language Learners. We critically examine and 
determine what actions empower our students to achieve and which areas need further 
development to enabl
e students to achieve greater success. Professional Learning Community, 
grade
-
level teams collaborate after each assessment to analyze data from both formative 
assessments such Star 360 Early Literacy, Reading, Math, CAASPP Interim Assessment Blocks, 
Writi
ng prompts, ELD assessments, curriculum
-
embedded assessments and summative (CAASPP, 
ELPAC) assessments to monitor student achievement and identify key learning targets within the 
Common Core State Standards to target and modify instruction. Teachers use gr
ade
-
level data to 

Acquiring academic English language continues to be an essential goal for Ramona School students, 
especially for our English Language Lea
rners (ELLs). For the 2019
-
2020 School Year, Ramona 
Elementary is providing parents the opportunity to enroll their children in a 50/50 Dual Immersion 
Program (DLI) starting in Kindergarten and first grade. We believe this switch from TBE to DLI will 
empow

access to non
-
English language. Every year we will be adding one class, up until every grade Kinder 
through fifth
-
grade class becomes DLI. 
 
 
Ramona's Vision 
-
 
Empo
wering Ramona Elementary students to achieve excellence through hard 
work, perseverance, and a commitment to lifelong learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC c
ontains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which des
cribes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent involvement is a key element for continued academic success at Ramona School.  Teachers regularly communicate with par
ents by phone, with 
written notes, in p
erson and through various activities on the site.  At the beginning and throughout the school year, parents are welcomed to R
amona 
School through a variety of general parent meetings, monthly principal meetings, parent nights, and individual parent meeting

standards
-

 
staff also 
presents parent education nights to help parents support their students in an acade
mic setting.  Our Outreach Consultant (ORC) facilitates parenting 
classes, which are offered in English and Spanish, with Mixteco translation as needed to further encourage participation and 
support positive interaction 
with their children.  We will contin
ue to offer the Latino Family Literacy Project designed to teach parents how to support their children in the area of 
reading, especially as it pertains to learning to read.  Parent Information Nights are held throughout the year to assist in 
the transitio
n of kindergartners 
and 5th graders into their new school settings.
 
 
We also have parents and community members participate in the School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Community (
ELAC), Parent/Teacher 
Association (PTA) and classroom voluntee

and throughout the week to better communicate vital information to parents. We maintain our connection with the community uti

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Ramona School community. Supervision is a responsibility shared 
among playground 
assistants,
 
teachers, and administration and other school staff. five full
-
time playground assistants monitor students before, during breaks, at lunch, and 
after school.
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has b
een developed by the Leadership Team/Safety 
Committee and reviewed annually by staff and parents.  Key elements of the Comprehensive Safety Plan focus on playground supe
rvision, disaster kits, 
and emergency procedures.
 
 
We will continue to implement CHAMPs
, a Positive Behavior Intervention Support plan (PBIS), Restorative Justice to support the instruction and 
continuance of positive behavior by students throughout the day and after school.  We continue to address concerns of safety 
outlined by the Safe and
 
Civil Schools Survey in which students, teachers, and parents participated
 
Ramona Elementary complies with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake stand
ards. Safety drills are 
held on a regular basis, altern
ating between fire, earthquake and campus intruder/lockdown drills.
