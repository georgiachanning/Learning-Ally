School Description
 
Prairie School is a rural school located in Shasta County between the cities of Anderson and 
Redding. Prairie School 
serves approximately 300 students in transitional kindergarten (TK) through 
3rd grade. Prairie School offers a self contained full
-
day transitional kindergarten class, full
-
day 
kindergarten, a fee
-
based preschool program for ages 3
-
4, and a fee
-
based after
 
school daycare 
program for Preschool to 8th grade.
 
 
Prairie School's goals are set to ensure all children meet or exceed the California state grade level 
standards in language arts and math, ensure the school experience is positive and safe, and offers 
st
udents an opportunity to develop confidence in their learning skills. To help students reach their 
state grade level goals, Prairie School has implemented the literacy center to support students that 
are below grade level in reading. In addition, Prairie S
chool teachers in grades K
-
2 just completed 
a 2 year grant focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). These practices 
have been implemented into each classroom, school wide. Prairie School students have the 
availability to be involved i
n extra curricular activities that include; cross country, POPS (Performers 
of Prairie School), Running Club, and academic intervention after
-
school club.
 
 
Pacheco District maintains an active parent
-
teacher organization, Pacheco Prairie Parent Teacher 
Gro
up that actively works to support student learning opportunities. The District also has the 
additional support of the Academic, Athletics, and Arts Foundation.
 
 
It is our mission to prepare students to be confident and empowered leaders for tomorrow's worl
d. 
Prairie School offers excellent academics.  We offer standards driven curriculum with engaging 
classrooms.  You will find learning environments for all students, from general education classes to 
special education classes, and from music to art, and phy
sical education.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Prairie School provides struggling readers with support via the Literacy Intervention Center. All 
students have the support of a Social/Emotional Counselor.  In addition,
 
students have the 
opportunity to participate in art, music, and an after
-
school academic support club. English learner 
students have academic support in the classroom.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides
 
reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are pu
blicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first

served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 
operation, the length of time that a
 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About
 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the L
ocal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities 
to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additi
onal information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
