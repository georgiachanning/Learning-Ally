By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sonoma Mountain School is one of five schools in the Old Adobe Union School District. Sonoma Mountain School opened 
in the 1997
-
1998 school year.  The mission statement was a collaborative effort, designed by staff, parent
s and students 
in 1997. It states that all stakeholders in Sonoma Mountain School shall work in partnership to create a learning 
environment where the joy of discovery and learning may be attained through active, child
-
centered learning, while 
building on 
the strengths and uniqueness of each child. All partners will help provide a safe, caring, and respectful 
environment for every student to meet the challenges of individual and cultural diversity, as children play together and 
learn together. In alignment 
with state and district guidelines we work toward achieving our goal of helping all children 
reach their full potential and to become productive members of society by fostering a family atmosphere, encouraging 
integration across grade levels, and creating 
a connection among students, teachers, and parents. A hands
-
on pathway to 
knowledge will be implemented, while teaching responsibility, cooperation, and respect for others. Students obtain skills 
in social participation, critical thinking and basic study s
kills.
 
 
With the expertise of very talented teachers, we meet our goals to teach writing daily, using programs called Write Tools 
and Writing by Design; teach reading and language arts daily, making sure students meet benchmark proficiency several 
times a 
year; improve our math skills, both conceptual and computational; teach social studies and science with state
-
adopted texts.  In addition to academic subjects our students are taught music and art weekly at each grade level with the 
help of several talente
d music and art teachers and an art program called Arts Attack. Our students participate weekly in 
learning 21st Century Skills in our Computer Lab and in
-
class devices such as ChromeBooks (1:1 in second through sixth 
grade), iPADs, and more. Because of th
e enormous support of our very active PTA, LCAP Advisory Council, and classified 
personnel, the teachers can excel at teaching the aforementioned subjects. These groups assist teachers either in the 
classroom or library, or fund supplies, our charter focus
, and technology which all make the students more successful.
 
 
We assess student academic success with a variety of state or district assessments several times a year. To ensure that 
students are on track in their reading development we use the DIBELS and 
STAR Reading assessments. To ensure our 
students are writing at grade level, we administer a district writing assessment three times a year for three various text 
types.  In order to measure math growth and proficiency, we administer the STAR Math assessme
nt three times a year. 
We also administer two state
-
mandated tests yearly, the SBAC (grades three through six) and the ELPAC (given to English 
Language Learners).
 
 
Finally, our charter focus is exceptional. Art is integrated into all subject areas, and we 
host an Artist in Residence who 
teaches our students about various mediums, styles, and artists. Our music instructor teaches singing and basic 
instruments to students in grades TK
-
2, recorders and song flutes to students in grades 3
-
4, and instrumental ba
nd to our 
students in grades 5
-
6. In addition, our focus includes a movement/dance component featuring an Artist in Residence who 
creates a rich, cultural experience for our students.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school. Their help is essential to keeping our school running
 
smoothly and to help ensure our students's academic, social and emotional success. We have a very active PTA and LCAP 
Advisory Cou
ncil. The PTA sponsors
 
student and family activities and organizes fundraisers to support school programs.
 
 
Our LCAP Advisory Council works with administration to help make financial decisions for the school based upon funding 
provided by the state.
 
 
We al
so have a group of Room Parents who meet regularly together and also work with the classroom teachers to help 
with
 
special classroom projects and trips.
 
 
Relationships are established before the first day of school at our Meet the Teacher and Lemonade Part
ies.  Each class 
opens their doors to students and parents 
-
 
everybody prepares for a great school year.  In addition, four evening SoMo 
University evenings are scheduled throughout the school year.  SoMo U is for all of our parents and caregivers.  Teache
rs 
and support staff offer informational sessions based on grade level learning scope, curriculum, and needs.  Parents can 
select sessions to attend based on what more you want to know and understand to better help your child in his/her 
learning journey.
 
 
Making a commitment to meet with your child's teacher at our twice yearly Parent
-
Teacher Conferences is
 
another way 
to stay connected to the school.  Parents are also welcome to attend many student performances, showcases of learning 
including Open House, 
and field trips.  Finally, we have parent helpers in many of the classrooms who help run centers or 
provide clerical support to teachers. There are always opportunities for involvement!

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Staff members and parents are visible and available on the school grounds before and after school. During the
 
morning/snack recess, teachers monitor the playground. At lunchtime the principal and several campus supervisors 
monitor students, and
 
during lunch recess campus supervisors monitor the students. Teachers regularly review the rules 
for safe, responsible
 
be
havior in school and on the playground. Several times a year the students meet with the principal 
grade level by grade
 
level to review safety rules and to address specific safety concerns which may have arisen during the 
school year. Signs are
 
posted at th
e parking lots and at the entrances directing all visitors to sign in at the school office, 
where they receive a badge
 
to wear throughout their stay. This helps ensure that we know who is on campus at all times.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan regularly.
 
The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of
 
emergency supplies. In addition we practice fire drills on a monthly basis and combine this four times a year to practice 
our earthquake procedures.  We also practice soft and h
ard lock down protocol.  Parents are aware of our School Safety 
Plan and understand their role in emergency procedures.
