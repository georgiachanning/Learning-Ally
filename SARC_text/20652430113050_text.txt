About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within t
he district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbo
oks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a
 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
mater
ials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
John J. Pershing is located on 17 acres of land in North East Madera. The school was built in 2007 with the remaining funds f
rom a 2002 bond measure. 
The campus consists of five building structures. Th
ree buildings house student classrooms which total 30. The administrative building houses the schools 

feteria houses the kitchen as
 
well as a stage area where our performing arts classes meet. In 2008, four portable classrooms were added to the campus to de
al with student growth. 
One additional portable classroom was added in 2013. Two additional portable classrooms were added in 2014
.
 
 
The campus has one soccer field and three baseball diamonds. It also includes six basketball courts, two four
-
square courts, and a large play structure. 
The kindergarten wing also has its own playground and shaded age appropriate play 
structure.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
 
The school is in excellent condition and the custodial staff does a great job of keeping rooms clean and things in good worki
ng condition. We have three 
full
-
time custodians who work on different shifts throughout the day. Thi
s ensures that we have a custodian on campus from 6:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. on 
every school day.
 
 
The campus is very secure. All gates are locked during the school hours with the exception of the front gate next to the offi
ce. This allows our office staff 
to
 
observe anyone coming onto or leaving campus. All visitors check in to the office before visiting any part of the campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

Committee and passed by the School Site Council in March, 2019. All revisions were communicated to both the classified and ce
rtificated staff. The 

 
drills are conducted on a 
monthly basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held three times per year. Students are su
pervised before and after school by certificated 
staff and administration. Administration and certificated staff supervise morning recess. Administration and classified noon
