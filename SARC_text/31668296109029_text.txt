About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

-
19)
 
All core curriculum materials have been reviewed for alignment with the California Content Standards (Common Core State Stand
ards) and Next 
Generation Science Standards, adopted by the State Board of Education 
(SBE).  These materials have been evaluated, piloted, and selected by a 
committee of teachers, and subsequently adopted by our governing board.  All students receive the appropriate and necessary c
urriculum and 
supplementary materials.  Permanent books are
 
loaned to students each year and collected at the end of the year.  Consumable materials are provided 
to each and every student to support classroom instruction.  For digital curriculum components, students without devices are 
allowed to loan a device 
for
 
access at home.
 
 
Teachers may, according to need, augment these materials with activities, materials, web
-
based resources and utilize instructional strategies they have 
learned in workshops or curriculum classes.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Types of Services Funded
 
Eureka Union School District is guided by its mission of "Working Together for Excellence 
-
 
Every Student, Every School, Every Day" and hence, its 
budget 
in focused on supporting high
-
quality instruction in the classroom.  The classroom is protected from funding cuts as much as possible to maintain EUSDs 
high academic performance. In a study conducted, the Eureka Union School District was found to ha
ve the highest percentage of budget dollars 
concentrated in the classroom (teachers, aides, materials, equipment) relative to other districts in the region.  EUSD also b
elieves in the education of the 
whole child, and its budget reflects this commitment.  
Several programs exist to support and promote socioemotional development and positive 
behavioral outcomes.  EUSD has the highest counselor to student ratio in the region.
 
 
For struggling and at
-
risk students, academic intervention support is available at a
ll sites.  Students and teaching staff also have access to technology to 
help make teaching and learning more effective.  There are instructional aides available for  providing direct support, wheth
er push
-
in or pull
-
out, to 
struggling students.  The distr
ict coordinates and provides support to programs that serve students representing different populations: SpEd, GATE, and 
EL. Each school site provides unique programs and resources based on identified needs.

g English learners).
