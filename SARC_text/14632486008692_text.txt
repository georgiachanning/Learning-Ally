School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Big Pine Elementary School offers an excellent program for all
 
of its students. Small class sizes and a sense of community 
provide a nurturing environment along with a powerful learning opportunity. Our ongoing improvement process continues 
each year. Student Led Conferences are a key opportunity for parent involveme
nt and for students to track their own 
academic progress.
 
 
We are in our seventh (7) year with EL Education and are implementing the core practices of the model. All teachers  
participate in EL Education training with the goal of transforming the learning 
experience to one of appropriate rigor, 
hands
-
on learning experiences and the collaborative skills needed for the 21st Century workplace.
 
 
Middle school students also experience a sense of community in small group settings, where teachers can develop posit
ive 
relationships with all students. Middle school students may participate in volleyball, basketball, and flag football. Student
s 
also have the opportunity to learn through fieldwork experiences, where students are able to take advantage of the 
geology, h
istory, and adventure opportunities of the area. During the ski season, students may participate in the Learn to 
Ski program.

Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The School Safety Plan is reviewed and updated yearly. Staff is provided a copy and training each year. The 
plan covers 
medical emergencies, natural disasters, bomb threats, active shooter response, earthquakes, fire, and chemical 
spills/accidents. The plan is complete, and coordinated with local emergency personnel and agencies. Teachers have first 
aid and emer
gency backpacks and buckets in their classrooms. The District requires school visitors to check in at the main 
office and wear identification badges. The campus is fully fenced preventing strangers from easily accessing student areas 
during school sessions
. The District has and enforces all current State policy in regard to student safety issues. The 
Emergency Preparedness Plan was last reviewed by faculty in August, 2019 and approved by the Board on September 3, 
2019.

EL Education and implementation of the Common Core State Standards are the common themes to staff development 
activities. Annual review of student achievement data 
drives our goals and strategies, and professional development is 
designed to support those. Annually there is a full review of external factors. In 2010
-
11 analysis of factors such as declining 
enrollment and economic uncertainty resulted in a full staff c
onsensus to pursue EL Education as our transformative model 
of education. Teachers have several paid noninstructional days during the school year that are used for full staff 
workshops. We also contract with a school designer who provides mentoring and spe
cialized, just
-
in
-
time workshops 
which teachers attend using substitute release time. Teachers are also sent to institutes, conferences and site visits to 
further our knowledge of expeditionary learning. Two countywide professional development days each ye
ar are provided 
by the County and keep the staff in touch with topics such as Common Core, new State Assessments, and Positive 
Behavioral Support. Teachers who return from conferences or training share their information with appropriate staff 
during staff 
meetings. All staff meetings are designed to provide professional development. Teachers are encouraged and 
supported in their efforts to pursue advanced degrees and specialized credentials. Our Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP), tied to our Western 
Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) accreditation, focuses our teacher training on 
student achievement through assessment, quality instructional methodology, and meeting the needs of a diverse student 
population. Each Monday is an early release day 
to provide time for staff to engage in student achievement data discussion 
and collaboration.
 
 
Teachers are asked to provide evidence of implementation in support of our workplan. Student Led Conference Portfolios 
for each student, including achievement da
ta, are available for review by administration and use at team meetings, and 
walk through observations are targeted to specific areas of focus that demonstrate implementation of learned strategies.
