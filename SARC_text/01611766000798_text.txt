School Description
 
Welcome to 
beautiful Parkmont Elementary School, a California Distinguished School in 2000, 2006 
and 2012!  Parkmont is an outstanding school because of the excellent teachers and staff, the 
wonderful parent support, and hard
-
working students.
 
 
Many students at 
Parkmont participate in numerous afterschool activities offered, which include 
art, writing classes, science enrichment, hip hop dance, and chess as well as Parkmont University 
where we offer enrichment classes for our students at low to no cost.  There ar
e also many sports 
activities offered including, tennis, frisbee, and basketball and soccer teams by tryouts for girls and 
boys in grades 4
-
6th.   We are also fortunate to have FAME, Music for Minors and Monart Art 
instruction in many classes.
 
 
The active 
PTA, with over 500 members, supports the school through our annual Panther Prowl (a 
fund
-
raising event), Red Ribbon Week, Teacher Appreciation, Reflections, arts in the classroom.  
The school is fortunate to have parent volunteers who provide music and art
 
activities, read with 
students in the morning, and assist teachers in the classroom as well as coordinates many family 
nights such as: Reading Night, Science Night, Math Night and Family Movie Nights.
 
 
The mission of Parkmont Elementary School:
 
In collabo
ration with our teachers, students and parents, we are committed to providing an 
education of excellence to meet the needs and interests of our students through an innovative, 
well
-
rounded curriculum that is relevant to the real world.
 
 
We continue to enco
urage a Growth Mindset with our students and staff at Parkmont.  In a growth 
mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and 
hard work

brains and talent are just the starting point.  This view creates a love 
of learning and a 
resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.  Virtually all great people have had these 
qualities.  We foster these growth mindset traits with Caught Working Hard wristbands.  When staff 
see students who exhibit these traits, a 
student earns a ticket.  These tickets can be turned in to 
the office for a Caught Working Hard wristband.  We are also focusing on being mindful this year.  
Teachers are implementing different mindfulness activities in their classrooms to allow students 
t
he time and space to calm down, be still and focus so that they can better learn and interact with 
others.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislat
ion calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of
 
our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our main building was built in 1964, and we have ten additional portables 
ranging from three to 13 years old.  Three 25
-
year
-
old portables were 
demolished in the summer of 2009.  Floors in the Science Lab and in room P10 were recently replaced.  We have one full
-
time day custodian, and two 
full
-
time night custodians who keep our
 
facilities clean.  Kindergarten classrooms are cleaned every day and all other classrooms are cleaned every other 
day. All restrooms are cleaned every day.  District maintenance removes graffiti and maintains landscaping on a regular weekl
y schedule.  The
 
Boy Scouts 
cleaned up the pedway from Peralta to the back entrance of Parkmont on Make a Difference Day and our Garden Club will maintai
n the garden regularly.    
In the lunch area, our students know how to sort their trash by compost, recyclable and non 
recyclable items and we have students help from each class 
to keep the area clean for our students.
 
 
We recently installed a new electronic marquis so that messages can be easily updated and visible.  This was funded by the PT
A.
 
 
To determine the condition
 
of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Faci
lities 

stions you see on this report.  
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report.  Since that time, thos
e conditions may have changed.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement is vital to our students' success.  We have many ways for parents to parti
cipate in our school, and we depend on parents to keep our 
programs running smoothly.  Parents can join our School Site Council (SSC), which works with administration to help make fina
ncial decisions.  Parents 
of English Learners are vital to our English L
anguage Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families.  Parents volunteer 
regularly to help in the classroom, on field trips and to organize celebrations throughout the year.
 
 
We buy new books for the library through PTA f
und
-
raisers.  The PTA also supports many different family nights on campus which include, Science, Math 
and Family Reading Nights, Family Movie Night as well as Family Movie Nights.  Parents coordinate our monthly Walk & Roll to 
school events to reduce 
tra
ffic and encourage a healthy lifestyle.  Parents are the docents of the visual and performing arts programs: FAME and Music f
or Minors and keep these 
opportunities running and available for our students.   We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night 
in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences in November.
 
 
We always need new volunteers!  No amount of help is too small.  To find out how you can volunteer at our school, please cont
act the school office.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the fol
lowing information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

School Safety Plan
 
Our Junior Safety Patrol helps students out of their c
ars, which ensures students get to school safely and on time.  Teachers supervise the playgrounds 
at recess time, and five lunch
-

nd
 
of the day at both parking loops to help with traffic flow and student safety.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan each February, with the last revision in February,
 
2019, which includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and 
inventories of emergency supplies.  We have copies of the plan in the office for parents and share it with all staff during a
 
school wide staff meeting.  We 
practice fire drills every month
 
and earthquake drills three times a year as well as a lockdown drill at least once annually.   Every year we conduct a small 
scale disaster drill where teachers work in assigned teams to search and rescue, mock first aid, and parent release triangle.
   
Th
e staff continually look 
for ways to make our school and  classrooms safe by taking items off the top of high cabinets and securing computers and prin
ters. We practice a variety 
of drills each month and will have a mock disaster drill in the spring. The st
aff has been trained on Run, Hide, Fight and some staff have been Trauma 
trained in the event of a mass casualty incident.
 
 
We are fortunate to have a school Safety Committee who works on keeping our Safety Storage compliant and up to date.   From 
rebates received from 
American Express via our Risk Management Department, we have most recently received ice packs and a portable cooler to transp
ort insulin in the event 
of a disaster.  We also have a newly installed AED located in the MUR and a Trauma K
it for Mass Casualty Incidents.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take 
some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the 
amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 day
s
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
