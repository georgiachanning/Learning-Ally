School Description
 
 
Originally a one
-
room schoolhouse, Sunnyside Elementary School is a historic school located in 
Bonita, within the boundary of the 49 schools of the Chula Vista 
Elementary School District. The 
school serves students in transitional kindergarten through sixth grade as well as several special 
day classes for students with special needs. The current building structure was built in 1959 and is 
scheduled to be extensiv
ely modernized during the summer of 2019. The school follows a modified, 
year
-
round calendar but will follow a traditional calendar during its upcoming summer of 

el. 
 
 
Sunnyside Elementary has 21 classrooms, a computer lab, a library, a child care room (YMCA), an 
auditorium and an administration building. The school serves a population of approximately 450 
students and maintains a variety of 
backgrounds, languages, and ethnicities with respect to the 
students and families it serves. Sunnyside students promote to Bonita Vista Middle School in the 
Sweetwater Union High School District. 
 
 
Sunnyside Elementary continues to fully implement Common C
ore State Standards (also known as 
the New California Standards), with a focus on improving reading ability, implementing speaking 
and listening standards, and aligning mathematics instruction with research
-
based practices. In 
alignment with the District's
 
mission to close the achievement gap through high impact language 
development strategies, the teaching staff is committed to improving self
-
efficacy for all students 
by enhancing instructional routines using success criteria and feedback. General educatio
n 
classrooms and special day class classrooms alike receive weekly professional development and bi
-
weekly collaboration time.
 
 
Sunnyside Elementary is fortunate to have a very supportive and active Parent Teacher 
Organization, also known as "Parents' Club"
. Each year, this group of parents continues to make a 
significant contribution to our school and it's mission. Besides supporting technology, the PTO also 
supports experiences, events and assemblies for students in all grade levels. This year, the PTO 
tec
hnology grant will go toward the purchase of new computers in our computer lab. This has 
enabled the school to purchase school
-
issued laptops for each teacher and replace outdated 
technology in classrooms around the school. 
 
 
Sunnyside Elementary is a "Cal
-
Well" school and has placed a great emphasis on improving the 
social
-
emotional situations of its students. The school has adopted the Pillars of Character and 
hosts monthly lessons, activities, and recognition ceremonies concerning each character pillar. 
The 
school utilizes the Sanford Harmony curriculum and Harmony Circles are implemented throughout 
the school. It has an active Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) / School Culture 
team that drives the implementation of proactive structures 
like "Restorative Practices" and 
"Trauma
-
Informed Care". The school partners with the San Diego County Office of Education to 
house a Mental Health Intern through the Cal
-
Well Program on our campus which provides support 
to up to 40 
-
 
50 students by foster
ing healthy self
-
concepts, social skills, and problem
-
solving skills 
for school and life success.
 
 
Before
-
and
-
after school clubs and programs at Sunnyside include the Sunnyside Bulldog Band, 
FitKids America, Robotics, Coding Club, Garden Club, Mathletes, E
xtended Day, Jumpstart Reading, 
Student Council, YMCA Licensed Childcare, and DASH.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (
SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

School Safety Plan
 
Sunnyside School is situated in a safe neighborhood on the edge of a rural community,
 
surrounded by former horse ranches.  Sunnyside has secure 
perimeter fences that are locked to ensure student safety during the school day.  The fences provide a single entry and exit 
point for the school during 
the school day allowing us to account for al
l who come (and leave) the school.  The School Site Council approved the Sunnyside's School Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness Plan in October of 2018.  Student safety and well
-
being is promoted by activities including emergency and earthquake 
preparedness 
drills, bus evacuation drills, lock
-
down drills, playground supervision, drug and alcohol abuse prevention education programs, and a School 
Safety Patrol. The school parking lot is exceptionally busy and parent volunteers are helpful in allowing the traffi
c to flow smoothly and efficiently. The 
parking lot was also improved last year by additional safety measures designed to have safer pick
-
up and drop
-
off of all students while also positively 
affecting the flow of traffic. Additional traffic signage and fl
ags have been introduced to catch the attention of motorists and increase parking lot safety. 
We have several character trait assemblies throughout the school year. Staff recognize students who demonstrate these traits 
through these recognition 
assemblies.
 
Rewards for appropriate student behavior, and consistent and fair consequences for inappropriate behavior are being applied b
y staff and 
administration.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The improvement of teaching and learning on campus is of vital importance to strengthening the Sunnyside educational communit
y.  Professional 
development takes place in the form of staff presentations, teacher collaboration around inquiry projects, demonst
ration lessons performed by the 
Resource Teacher, peer observations, and collaborative time for teams to implement learning.  This learning occurs within our
 
school and within our 
district cohort of schools.
 
 
Sunnyside has an on
-
site District Resource Teac
her who works with the principal and staff to plan and provide professional development during staff 
meetings and during weekly grade level collaboration.
 
 
The academic focus for English Language Arts is that all students will show measurable growth in gra
de level text with purpose, understanding, and 
comprehension through the use of high impact reading strategies.
 
 
Mathematics professional development has focused on having students represent concepts in a variety of ways, and also to be a
ble to explain the
ir 
thinking orally and in writing. Teachers are using a protocol called Professional Noticings to analyze student work, identify
 
common misconceptions, and 
plan next steps for instruction. Teachers are working closely with the District Math Resource Teache
r and cohort as they engage in this work.
 
 
Sunnyside Staff have also been receiving additional training in the teaching of English Learners.  Staff have been trained in
 
a variety of techniques that 
will help English Learners to become fully English profici
ent as quickly as possible. Sunnyside continues to participate with Project GLAD, and are working 
on both designated and integrated supports for students.
 
 
Sunnyside staff is also receiving ongoing training on Achieve 3000 for grades 2
