By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a
 
School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Lo
cal Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with
 
data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more
 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community member
s should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enr
ollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to L.U.C.H.A. where we are Learning in an Urban Community with High Achievement!  L.U.C.H.A. is a small school 
of choice. There
 
are four core values that are non
-
negotiable. The core values are: RESPECT, RESPONSIBILITY, 
COMPASSION and HARD WORK.
 
Students at L.U.C.H.A. are expected to excel. HIGH EXPECTATIONS are built into the school culture. We are preparing 
students with the nec
essary skills for them to be successful in top quality high schools, colleges and the competitive world 
beyond. However, we also know that this cannot be done in isolation. Each student, parent, family and staff member must 
work collaboratively to ensure t
his success. At L.U.C.H.A., parent participation is not an afterthought, it is an expectation. 
If you want the very best for your child and want to learn more about L.U.C.H.A., please feel free to contact me or any of 
our staff members.
 
I look forward to s
haring the enthusiasm and love of learning that has come to characterize L.U.C.H.A.  Please feel free to 
contact the principal or any staff member.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the dis
trict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the S
tate of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
The building in which L.U.C.H.A. resides was built in 1966. School facilities were constructed and are being 
renovated 
according to the Field Act requirements of the State Building Code that is heavily focused on earthquake safety. In the 
event that asbestos and lead containing building materials are found, they are managed and removed according to EPA 
and State 
and local requirements. Deferred maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate district 
buildings.  Needed repairs and maintenance projected are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
School facilities are upgraded whenever possible to support
 
and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 

 
the instructional program. The Alum Rock Union Elementary School Distric
t maintenance staff, in conjunction with day 
and night custodians, ensures the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial 
schedules ensure that classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices,
 
and playgrounds are clean for both 
student and staff use.
 
 
Regular oversight by district maintenance crews ensures that grass and landscaped areas are well maintained and that the 

 
 
All visitors 
are required to check
-
in at the school office. Fire drills and disaster procedures are specifically outlined and 
regularly updated and practiced. Safety programs include drug awareness, personal safety, and personal growth. To 
ensure a safe environment, th
e district provides yard duty supervisors, and all yard duty supervisors and school staff 
maintain a welcoming but controlled campus environment. The school grounds and playground are safe because they 
well
-
supervised by staff before, during, and after sch
ool.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
L.U.C.H.A. operates under the premise that the teachers, parents, and students must work together as partners to create 
a quality education. Parents are a vital part of this partnership and will have many opportunities to participate in their 

tion. L.U.C.H.A. involves parents as key stakeholders in the school. Parents have been an integral part of the 
school community from its inception.  Parents are a critical component of L.U.C.H.A. because they ensure that the school 
is not invested solely i
n educators or teachers. Rather, the school is invested in parents, families, and directly with the 
community. Parents participate in the leadership and governance of the school and make various other commitments to 
L.U.C.H.A. The commitments for parental 
support include reading with their child each night, ensuring that homework is 
completed every night, assisting their child in contacting the teacher regarding any problem or question on an assignment, 
providing a quiet place with light for their child to 
study at home, and being available to meet with the teachers at home 
or at school if the need arises.
 
 
In addition, volunteer hours are required from parents. Parents and families are required to fulfill 30 volunteer hours per 
year. These volunteer hours m
ay be fulfilled through volunteering at the school, attending community meetings, 
participating in activities at school, attending school events on weeknights or weekends, and helping in other ways as 
needs arise. Parents are encouraged to participate in o
ur biannual Exhibition Nights where the students showcase the 
projects they have created.  Other opportunities for parent involvement include participation in the Parent Leader Group, 
School Site Council, Los Dichos reading program, attendance at principal

and chaperoning of local field trips.
 
 

individuals and organizations in the communit
y that are dedicated to helping students obtain their academic goals.  The 

program is composed of community members, the business communit
y, college students, high school students, and 
parents. Volunteers perform duties that include reading with students, small group tutorials, office assistance, and serving 
as guest presenters during life skills classes. Additionally, members from various c
ommunity organizations may be invited 
to teach after school classes. The school partners with various community organizations for community service projects. 
Community members also have an opportunity to participate in the governance of the school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
L.U.C.H.A. Elementary School has a very detailed, comprehensive safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and 
procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains the yearly saf
ety goals as determined by the 
students, staff, and parents. The safety plan is developed by the L.U.C.H.A. Safety Committee before it is annually 
presented to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District Board of Trustees for approval. The revised plan 
was last 
approved in December 2017. The Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety alerts 
are shared with all staff as needed throughout the school year. In addition, all required drills are calendared and 
complete
d, and the results are shared with the staff. The L.U.C.H.A. Safety Plan has a comprehensive, enforceable, and 
continuous: Behavior Policy, Rules and Regulations, Dress Code Policy, Protocols for Safety/Emergency Drills, Tardy Policy, 
Attendance Policy, Re
ferral Policy, and Nondiscriminatory Policy on Student Rights and Responsibilities.
 
 
Our comprehensive approach to creating safe and effective schools includes four components that interact and affect the 
safety of the whole campus. The four components are
 
the personal characteristics of students, school, community and 

 
 
It is difficult, if not impossible, to create a safe school plan without a clear knowledg
e of the students, families, and staff 
who will present themselves at the school on a daily basis. Personal characteristics that are considered include the ethnic 
and cultural backgrounds and expectations, health concerns, life experiences, and unique qual
ities that students and staff 
bring to the school.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff development supports the schools mission and 
basic values by fostering a positive campus culture, sharing the best 
instructional practices, and encouraging individual teacher growth. Teachers are provided time to collaborate with their 
colleagues to engage in curricular mapping and backwards planning
 
to ensure instruction is most effective.
 
 
LUCHA teachers are driven by our belief that our students are today's readers, tomorrow's leaders.  Our professional 
development has been focused on building a strong balance literacy program that emphasizes meeti
ng students' varied 
reading needs through regular guided reading instruction.  Staff regularly engage in results oriented cycles of inquiry to 
determine how to best meet student needs. This work is driven by the site's Instructional Leadership team and car
ried out 
at both whole group staff meetings and ongoing grade level collaboration meetings.
 
 
The principal provides instructional feedback to teachers during her walkthroughs and during regular one to one check 
ins.
