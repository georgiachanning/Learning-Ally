By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Tierra Buena School is to promote a lifelong love of learning that is reflected in student performance, self
-
esteem and citizenship.
 
 
Tierra Buena School, home of the Eagles, continues in its commitment to inspire students to 
academic excellence within 
a community that nurtures mindfulness, empathy, honesty, tenacity, wisdom, and courage, all with a positive attitude. 
Our goal is to prepare students for life in the 21st century with skills that enhance creativity, critical thin
king/problem 
solving, collaboration, communication and curiosity.
 
 
The staff at Tierra Buena is fully engaged in collaborating to develop lessons and align all instruction to meet the rigor an
d 
depth of knowledge expected by the California Common Core Stan
dards, CCCS.  We are a team of educators who use both 
formative and summative data across all subject areas to drive instruction and make the curriculum accessible to all of 
our students. Our district believes in professional development for our teachers t
hat match district and site goals.
 
 
Our goal is that all students will achieve grade
-
level proficiency, or above, in reading, writing, math and science in a safe, 
supportive, and enriching school environment. Our Character Development curriculum focuses on
 
the importance of 
positive peer relationships, the value of honesty, empathy and self
-
discipline to be better equipped to make the right 
choices.  Our Expanded Learning Program provides our students a safe and nurturing after school program that promotes 
growth in the social, cognitive and physical development.
 
 
As principal of Tierra Buena School, I am privileged to be a part of this community where together we can strengthen the 
positive learning experience of all our students. When the school and famili
es work together with common goals and 
aspirations, we form a powerful alliance on behalf of our children, who in turn, achieve a higher degree of success.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
During the summer of the 2019, TB school underwent a small scale construction project. We moved and remolded two 
modular 
classroom, which now house the Sutter County Deaf and Hard of Hearing, (DHH) program located near on the 
South/East side of our campus; P
-
6B and P
-
6C.  We were on target for the completion of the two modulars and ready to 
receive the students and staff of 
the DHH program on the first day of school due to the hard work and dedication of the 
YCUSD Maintenance Department. Our track and field received a complete overhaul. It was scraped and reseeded. We also 
completed the installation of the iron gates in the f
ront of our campus. The landscape in the front of the school was planted 
by volunteers from a local church so that the landscape on the east side of campus matches the landscape on the north 
end of campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may
 
participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and the community are very supportive of the education program at Tierra Buena School. Teachers invite 
parents 
into their classrooms to serve as volunteer aides and to help with classroom projects, special events, and to accompany 
the students on field trips. Parents may also serve as library aides. They oftentimes bring their own expertise as guest 
speaker
s into the classrooms.
 
 
At Tierra Buena School we have a School Site Council (SSC), an English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and the Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA), which are great organizations to get involved with that positively impact our entire
 
school 
community.  PTA meets the first Tuesday of every month at 6:00 p.m. in the School Library. SSC meets the third Wednesday 
of every month at 5:00 p.m. in our School Library.  ELAC meets four times each year.

Tierra Buena School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district installed fencing 
to enclose the front of the school so a
ll foot traffic must travel in front of the office to enter campus. Students are 
supervised by classified staff, teachers, and administrators before, during and after school. During morning recess, during 
class time, passing periods and lunch recess, yard 
duty personnel and administrators supervise students. Crossing guards 
assist with supervision before and after school. There is a designated student drop off and pickup area at the main 
entrance of the school. YCUSD busses drop and pick up students at the 
north side of campus. All visitors must sign in at 
the office, where they receive a badge that must be displayed at all times.
