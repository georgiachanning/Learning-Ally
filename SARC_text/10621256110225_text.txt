About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

All of our professional development is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, survey
s, disaggregation of 
CAASPP data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers at Dawson participate in professional training cour
ses designed to support educational 
priorities and objectives. Staff Professional Development Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for 
administrators, teachers 
and classified personnel. The major areas of focus are in literacy, ma
thematics, and English Language Development for all content areas.
 
 
Dawson teachers improve teaching skills and learn concepts by participating in professional conferences and workshops through
out the school year. At 
these conferences and workshops they di
scuss instruction, classroom practices, and innovations in education. We determine the areas of focus for staff 
development through analysis of student achievement data and collaboration with teachers.  Dawson has participated in staff d
evelopment for the 
SEAL 
model, Reader's and Writer's Workshops, Guided Reading, Math Number Talks, Data Team process, and Kagan Structures to enhance
 
instructional 
practices.  Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) and Time To Teach classroom management trainings have
 
been offered and taken by staff to 
create positive learning climates and improve student behavior on our campus.  We also have coaching for Instructional Techno
logy with our district 
coach and offer after
-
school technology trainings.  Dawson also particip
ates in SEAL module training and unit development day support training.  
Additionally, during weekly Professional Learning Community (PLC) meetings, teachers share their best practices with one anot
her addressing the 
students' varied achievement levels. Da
wson is currently implementing their second year in the Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) model, which 
is a research
-
based PreK
-
3rd grade model designed to develop the language and literacy skills of Dual Language Learners (DLLs) and to close the 
achi
evement gap between language learners and their native
-
English speaking peers by 4th grade.

profession teachers are also supported through a Teacher Induction Program and with new teacher support. A teacher that is te
aching under 
a PIP or STSP,
 
or is an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect s
upport for 
his/her individualized professional growth. In addition, the teachers attend required professional development provided
 
by the district and school site. 
New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal Induction Program via Fresno County Superintendent 
of Schools(FCSS). Teachers 
participating in this program receive support from a trained support p
rovider for two years.  New teachers, along with their mentors (support providers) 
attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, the program may offer additional professional development o
fferings based on 
participant request. Support P
roviders (SP) attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are required 
to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings each year to work on their mentoring skills.
 
 
At school sites, teachers a
re supported during implementation by their grade

level or content colleagues through Professional Learning Communities as 
well.
