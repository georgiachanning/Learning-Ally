About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Conten
t Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school is on its last stage of completing a major technology update under Measure E. We now have increased internet acces
s and an updated phone 
and public address system.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facili
ties, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 

ions you see
 
on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents/guardians at Durham have many opportunities to be involved. Parents/guardians can joi
n our School Site Council (SSC) and work with 
administration and staff to help make programmatic and financial decisions. The parents/guardians of English Learners are enc
ouraged to be part of the 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) to provide input
 
and feedback to ensure a powerful program for our English Learners. Parents/guardians 
of students identified as high achievers or part of the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Program are invited to join the 
GATE Advisory Committee 
and consult with sta
ff on improving enrichment offerings. Our Safety Committee is another group that parents/guardians are welcome to join. Our P
arent 
Teacher Association (PTA) is always looking for volunteers to help organize fundraisers and extracurricular activities for fa
milies and students. We invite 
our parents/guardians to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the Fall to meet our staff and come to Open House each Spring to see the accomplishments of 
our students. Other school events are the Fun Run, Olympics, Holi Color Celeb
ration, Talent Show, and several family nights per year to help families 
learn about ways to support their children. Parents/guardians are also welcome to assist in the classrooms as volunteers or c
ome as speakers on Career 
Day. With a strong family and sc
hool connection, we know that our students will grow and succeed!

School Safety Plan
 
Our School Safety Plan was last revised in March 2019 and a committee is in place to ensure that the plan is updated annually
. The plan includes 
procedures for emergencies and disasters. Emer
gency supplies are replenished as needed with sufficient items inside every classroom. Our emergency 
shed located in our playground area is also equipped with needed materials in case students and staff need to evacuate and re
main outdoors. We hold 
fire dr
ills monthly and various disaster drills four times per year. Campus visitors are required to sign in and out of the office a

passes while on campus. Staff members wear employee badges that include their names and photographs. Teacher
s and classified staff assist the principal 
in maintaining safety in the parking lot before and after school. Over 90% of our staff are CPR certified, and many are train
ed in administering the epi
-
pen. We also recently acquired trauma kits for our school o
ffice.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to 
improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
201
8
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
