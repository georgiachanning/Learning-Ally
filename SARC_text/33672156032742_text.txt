By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

The parental involvement contact at this school is Erica Square, Principal, and Vinh Tran, Assistant Principal.  Both can be 
contacted at 951
-
788
-
7355.
 
 
There are a number of ways parents can be involved at Pachappa Elementary to support the school and the
ir child's 
education.  We have three parent groups that parents can select to be involved with, School Site Council, English Language 
Advisory Committee, and the Parent Teacher Association. The School Site Council consists of parents and staff who work 
tog
ether to plan and evaluate Pachappa programs that receive special funding. Members on the council and committee 
are elected. However, the meetings are open and all parents are encouraged to attend and participate. The second type 
of parent group is the Eng
lish Language Advisory Committee.  The English Learner Advisory Committee is an advisory group 
consisting of parents and staff members who meet to discuss the planning and implementation of the programs for English 
Language Learners. The committee advises 
the principal and staff on community concerns and learns about instructional 
programs and school procedures. The third group is the Parent Teacher Association.  The PTA is a service organization that 
provides hundreds of hours of volunteer work, supports t
he curriculum on an annual basis, and strives to build a positive 
school culture.
 
 
In addition to the above groups, Pachappa holds events throughout the school year to involve parents in building a positive 
school climate and parent education.  The last Mo
nday of every month we host Lunch on the Lawn.  This is an opportunity 
for parents and loved ones to come and eat lunch with their children.  PTA also sponsors numerous parent events such as 
Book Fair, Coffee with the Principal, and Association Meetings.  
PTA also works with various foundations to provide other 
parental training.  Each year the school hosts a minimum of two AVID information events.  The AVID events give the school 
an opportunity to share the strategies the students are learning with their p
arents.  Classes have also been offered in 
English Language acquisition for parents.  Parents are also encouraged to volunteer in the child's classroom.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council in collaboration with the Site Safety Committee are responsible for the development and updating 
of the school's Comprehensive Safety Plan. A Site 
Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the Pupil Services 
Department to give guidance on what should be included in the School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with 
staff, evaluated, amended/reviewed/updated by March 1 of each year. 
The school's safety committee makes monthly 
safety inspections. A school Disaster Preparedness Plan that deals with a wide variety of emergency situations is 
incorporated into the School Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, lockdown, and active shooter/intrude
r drills are conducted 
as required. The key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include an assessment of current status of school 
crime; provisions of any schoolwide dress code including the definition of "gang related apparel"; safe movement 
of pupils, 
parents and school employees to and from school; strategies in maintaining a safe and orderly school environment; visitors 
on campus; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to 
suspensions, 
expulsion or mandatory expulsion and other school designated serious acts which would lead to suspension 
or expulsion, notification to teachers, anti
-
bullying policy, discrimination/harassment, and school discipline rules and 
procedures pursuant to EC 3529
1 and EC 35291.5. The school also has an assigned School Resource Officer (SRO).

Staff development needs are determined by analyzing annual standards assessments for areas of strength and weakness 
by grade and teacher in the areas of language arts, mathematics, English language development and 
science. Monthly 
staff meetings include training in identified areas of need. In addition, the staff attends a variety of professional 
development and other activities sponsored by the school, district, or through Special Projects that are appropriate for 
their individual needs. The principal regularly monitors teaching and learning to ensure that teachers are implementing 
what they have learned during their training through the use of classroom visits, in
-
class coaching, and achievement 
conferences. Teache
rs in grades K
-

level expectations. During 2017
-
2018 and 2018
-
2019, the site worked with an early literacy consultant to support our site 
goal of all students reading by 
third grade. The consultant provided training, in class coaching, and support with data
