About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requir
ed by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an L
CAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Professional growth activities are planned annually based on current need and input received from staff.  For each of the las

work calendar has included professional development days.  Weekly and monthly collaborative instructi
onal planning (CIP) time is provided for teachers 
to plan lessons and activities, review assessment data, and research instructional practices and resources.  This year profes
sional development for our 
school centers around early literacy, the California S
tate Standards for Math, and social
-
emotional learning.
 
Standards
-
based lessons are the foundation for what is taught and assessed in our district and therefore at our school.  Teachers use a
 
positive growth 
mindset while planning and delivering instructio
n for students and encourage them to use the same when working and playing with classmates.  Rio 
Vista teachers have received specific training and professional development on Direct Instruction, Systematic English Languag
e Development, and 
Positive Behavi
oral Interventions and Supports.  We are implementing Professional Learning Communities.
