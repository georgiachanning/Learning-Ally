School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

first year of Safe School Ambassadors. Evergreen currently houses four Special Education Special Day Classes for CRPUSD, 
which contribute to our inclusive school environment for students of all abilities. Staff members work in partnership wi
th 
families to successfully meet the needs of all our students. Our teachers frequently review data to make informed 


cess. Our PTA works tirelessly to raise funds through our annual Evergreen Walk

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Evergreen was built in 1978. In the past 19 years, Deferred Maintenance program funds have been used to upgrade and 
modernize various building systems. Improvement projects have included upgrades to 4 roofs, paving, painting, as well as 
HVAC and technology systems. Five portable buildings were acquired in 1989
-
1991 to accommodate the increased student 
population. These portables, along with the six classroom building pods, the administration office, and the multi
-
purpose 
building that pri
ncipally serves as the cafeteria building, became part of the permanent structures that house students. 
As with all District facilities, yearly evaluations are conducted to assess and address ongoing Maintenance needs and 
Deferred Maintenance projects to u
phold the preservation of building systems. In the summers of 2005 and 2006, 
improvements were made to roofing and exterior finish systems. In the summer of 2008, six (6) portable classrooms and 
one (1) portable toilet room were added to form an additional
 
classroom wing to accommodate an increase in enrollment 
due to the closure of Gold Ridge Elementary. In the Spring of 2018, the school office was extensively remodeled. In the 
Winter of 2019, an additional play structure was added to the grass area of the
 
school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Evergreen is known for its strong community support. As a school and a family we continually strive to improve our 
relationships, recognizing that the effort of the whole team is needed to help every child be successful. Parents are viewed 
as partners and 
encouraged to take active roles in our school program. Every school day, parents are on campus 
participating in our morning walk, creating bulletin boards, hanging posters, tutoring children, attending field trips, 
organizing fundraisers, participating in 
committees, and meeting formally and informally with the Principal and Assistant 
Principal. Our close proximity to Sonoma State University offers an opportunity to benefit from a university supported 
after school homework program called Study Buddies.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

The Evergreen Comprehensive School Safety Plan is reviewed, evaluated and amended each year. The plan covers such 
topics as: assessment of the current status of school crime, child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, 
suspension policies, schoo
l
-
wide discipline plan, and other topics required by education code. The school staff and parent 
group work together to implement and practice our disaster plan, and provide supplies for emergency kits. All staff 
members have a Walkie
-
Talkie that can be ut
ilized during the school day for routine procedures, as well as in the event of 
an emergency. Additionally, we are in our second year of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and our 
first year of Safe School Ambassadors to ensure that stud
ents feel like school is a safe and welcoming place. We post Seth's 
Law for Non
-
Discrimination and Harassment (Board Policy 5145.3), Bullying (Board Policy 5131.2) and offer a Uniform 
Complaint Procedure process (Board Policy 1312.3). The Evergreen School 
Site Council met on September 30, 2019 to 
review and approve the 2019
-
2020 Comprehensive School Safety Plan.
