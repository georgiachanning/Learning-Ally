Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

office. Components of the plan include school site safety and 
security, disaster and emergency preparedness, Mandated 
Reporter requirements for suspected child abuse and neglect, suspension and expulsion policies, due process procedures, 
staff notification of dangerous pupils, due process policy, sexual harassment po
licy, dress code requirements, and rules

which was last done in August 2019.  The CSSP was reviewed and approved by the School Site Council
 
in February 2019.   
An approved copy of the school site safety plan may be obtained in Arroyo's office or at the Ontario

The Ontario

Montclair School District offers ongoing research
-
based professional development for certificated, classified 

-
term goals outlined in the LCAP plan which has been created 
based on feedbac
k from all  stakeholders. Professional development is designed to  help employees enhance their 
knowledge and develop needed skills to provide quality services in order to maximize student learning and achievement. 
Professional development courses and prog
rams are developed and coordinated through the district's Learning and 
Teaching Department as well as at the school site. The focus of all professional development is based on the instructional 
priorities outlined in the goals and objectives of our School 
Plan for Student Achievement. In addition, paraprofessionals 
such as instructional aides are offered training through the Learning and Teaching Department and Special Education 
Department. Clerical and Custodial staff training also occurs through the Maint
enance and Operations Department and 
by District Education personnel.
 
 
To ensure continuous improvement, district level professional development for our certificated staff includes training in 
the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, Common Core 
State Standards, Eureka math program, Next Generation 
Science Standards (NGSS), writing development, English language learner development, workshop sessions and classroom 
support for beginning teachers (BTSA), support for veteran teachers through the Peer 
Assistance and Review program 
(PAR), technology training and classroom support, leadership development for administrators, and a variety of job
-
specific 
and mandated training for classified employees.
 
 
The site
-
level professional development at Arroyo focu
ses on areas such as grade level student data analysis, formative 
and summative assessment analysis and creation, close reading, ELA strategies, ELD, writing, conceptual understanding, 
Eureka Math, and International Baccalaureate inquiry
-
based instructiona
l strategies. Teachers are given opportunities to 
observe colleagues through the Instructional Rounds process and are provided release time to plan for instructional 
implementation and integration of Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and Next Generation S
cience Standards (NGSS) 
within IB units of study.
 
 
The annual number of days provided for Professional Development varies by teacher and grade
-
level, but on average is 4
-
6 days per school year. Student achievement data is used to determine the need for pro
fessional development, which is 
delivered after school and/or during full day conferences both inside and outside the district. Grade levels have two to 
three half
-
day releases to analyze student data and plan for upcoming instruction and assessments. Coac
hing is provided 
to teachers by the TOA Magnet Academy Coordinator and site administrators.
