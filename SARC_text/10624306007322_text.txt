By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Terry Elementary is one of eleven schools in the Selma Unified School District. Currently we have a total of 201 students 
enrolled in grades Kindergarten through sixth grade. Terry Elementary is a rural school with a diverse population. The
 

expectation; Impact our community; and Lead positively with great character; "SAIL" 

 
weather the storms in life. Equally 
important to bui
lding strong character in our students our academic program facilitates the development of foundational 
skills and the application of higher order thinking skills. Through the integration of academics, values, leadership 
opportunities, and social interacti
on, students are provided with the opportunities to reach their potential as w ell as 
acquire the necessary skills to compete in the 21st century and become contributing members of society. Our team of 
teachers and support staff are dedicated to provide ex
emplary programs, services and activities consistent with the 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Teachers adhere to teaching the grade level standards and use frequent formative 
assessments to monitor student growth towards mastering the necessary skills 
at that grade level.
 
 
Technology is also an integral part of instruction. Teachers have been able to integrate technology in several ways to 
improve student learning through the use of web
-
based programs which assist with reading, writing, math and science
. 
The most important aspect is that technology integration has become a standard in reinforcing concepts and skills, as well 
as assessing student learning. Our current Chromebook ratio is 1:1.  Our priortiy has been to make sure every student has 
access to
 
a chromebook daily.
 
 
Based on the 2019
-
20 data, 53% of our students are classified as English Language Learners (EL's). In order to ensure our 
EL's are making academic gains, as w ell as advancing towards proficiency in English, students are deployed base
d on their 
English Proficiency Level for English Language Development 30 minutes daily. Teachers build their lessons using the CA 
ELD standards, incorporate content and language objectives, as well as use various strategies to support student learning 
for 
our EL's across all content areas. Student progress is monitored through the ELPAC (English Language Proficiency 
Assessment for California).

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Effective family school 
partnerships are crucial to the success of the school as well as students. We know that when parents 
are involved in their child's education, it has a significant impact on student achievement, as well as a child's social and 
emotional growth. In order to 
establish effective and strong partnerships, it is important for our families to feel valued 
and respected, as well as connected to our school. As a site, we accomplish this through offering our parents various 
opportunities to be involved with our school.
 
In addition to parent involvement opportunities, we also offer various 
trainings and workshops throughout the year to empower our parents. We will continue to offer parents the opportunity 
to participate in the PIQE Program (Parent Institute for Quality E
ducation). The goal of this program is to engage, empower, 
and transform parents to actively engage in their children's education as well as to strengthen parent
-
school collaboration. 
This is a nine
-
week program in which parents attend on a weekly basis fo
r 1.5 hrs. 
-
 
2hrs. We have also partnered with the 
Selma Neighborhood Resource Center to share the type of resources they offer as well as present to parents.  Some of 
the topics they will cover this year include: Vaping Awareness, Fatherhood, and Anger Ma
nagement.
 
 
Parents involved in our school site committees also have the opportunity to attend the California Association of Bilingual 
Educators (CABE) as well as local workshops sponsored by colleges as w ell as Fresno County Superintendent of Schools.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of having a Safe School Plan is to have a plan in place which helps 
prevent, protect, and respond to 
emergencies that may arise on campus. A Safe School Plan also requires having many preventative measures in place for 
children's mental and emotional issues as well as a comprehensive approach to early identification of all
 
warning signs 
that may lead to violence toward self or others. All staff, parents, and members of the community must be part of revising 
and updating this plan annually. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff
 
safety during a disaster, including a comprehensive crisis plan. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake drills are 
conducted quarterly, and lock down/intruder drills are conducted twice per semester. In addition, we have annual 
inspections conducte
d by the Fresno Fire County Fire Department and also work with the Sheriff's Department to review 
lock down drills. The Raptor Visitor Management System is used throughout the district to ensure staff and student safety. 
This is a web
-
based visitor managem
ent system designed to screen visitors against sex offender registries in every state 
and against each school's database for custody issues and other customized alerts.
 
At Terry school we strive to promote a safe and healthy learning environment. We minimi
ze all threats and hazards to 
staff and student safety through vigilance, training, practice, and systems that we have in place.
 
 
Each SUSD facility and the administrative site will have a Safe School Leadership Team (SSLT) to take charge of 
emergencies, r
espond effectively and efficiently, protect the occupants of the facility and reduce the risk of physical injury, 
property damage and business interruption. The team consist of the Principal and/or designee, administrative assistant, 
school nurse, SRO (if 
applicable), certificated and classified employee. Each person has an alternate should they not be on 
campus.
 
 
Our school site safety plan will be reviewed with our SSC in January of 2020. Areas to be addressed include: review of 
disaster procedures as wel
l as discuss the new laws in regards to discipline.  The following stakeholders will have the 
opportunity to provide input on the site plan: certificated and classified staff, School Site Council, parents as well as 
students.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

Terry Elementary School provides a variety of programs and supplemental services for students at the Tier II and Tier III 
level. During the 2018
-
19 school year identified students were able to receive additional support in the area of reading, 
writing as w
ell as behavioral support. These additional services were funded through LCFF (Local Control Funding Formula) 
as well as Title I funding. With these funds we were able to continue to fund a 1.0 FTE (Full Time Equivalent) teacher to 
provide Tier II reading 
support, and an 80% retired teacher to support students at the Tier III level for needs in basic 
reading skills as well as comprehension. Our support staff utilizes various programs which help the specific needs of our 
students.  Those programs include: Re
ad Naturally, Reading Recovery, SNAP, Lindamood
-
Bell programs that help address 
phonemic awareness, reading comprehension, as well as fluency. Additionally, Terry receives ASES (After School Education 
and Safety Program) grant money which has enabled us to
 
offer our parents an after school program. Approximately 45% 
of our students participate in our after school program. Through this program students have access to music lessons, art 
lessons, homework support, tutoring, running a produce market, as well as
 
participating in special projects. During the 
2018
-
19 school year interested students designed and sewed blankets. These blankets were donated to the residents of 
the Selma Convalescent Home.

Selma Unified School District supports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through a Site Based Coaching 
model.  This model allows for job embedded Professional learning by implementing the tenets of the Professional Learning 
Community framewor
k. The district maintains a ELA/ELD, Math and Science coaching team that in turn support and 
provide instructional support for our site level coaching team. In collaboration with both teams, professional learning for 
teachers is provided to assist all stud
ents in achieving the State academic standards, with an emphasis on addressing and 
supporting student groups requiring additional resources; groups such as Foster Youth, English Learners, and 
Students 
with Disabilities.
 
 
The District also provides all teac
hers with three professional learning days throughout the year.  These are non
-
student 
days that are planned and facilitated by site leaders and site coaches.  For the last couple of years, these days focus on 
allowing teachers time for instructional plann
ing as they apply to the California Standards for the Teacher Profession 
(CSTPs 3, 4, & 5).
 
 
The primary focus at Terry Elementary has been to ensure our students have strong reading foundation skills, strong 
reading comprehension, as well as a solid conce
ptual understanding, skills and fluency in math.  Equally important is the 
social and well
-
being of every student. These targeted areas have been selected based on the various assessments 
administered throughout the years.  At Terry we use the Basic Phonic
s Skills Test (BPST), district and curriculum benchmark 
assessments for both reading and math, fluency assessments, Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA), common 
formative assessments, the CA Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) and the
 
English Language 
Proficiency Assessments for CA (ELPAC) and observational notes.  These assessments/notes are used to monitor student 
progress as well as help us determine specific areas of need for students who may be struggling academically.  A big 
emph
asis has been early literacy development in which teachers have received support with guided reading groups as 
well as small reading groups.  Teachers have had the opportunity to attend full day trainings as well as half day trainings 
in our district and o
n our site.  This past summer four of our teachers had the opportunity to attend the San Joaquin Valley 
Math Project.  The emphasis of this institute was to help teachers build skills to effectively lead PLC's , examine the 
research behind the powerful ins
tructional approaches such as Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), problem
-
based 
learning, lesson study, as well as learn effective ways to link the CA CCSS
-
Mathematics standards with instruction and 
assessment.

Each of our grade levels have also partic
ipated in the New Science Standards Generation (NGSS) trainings offered by 
Fresno County Superintendent of Schools. These trainings have helped teachers become better versed with the new 
science standards and the best instructional practices for teaching s
cience.  After teachers participate in trainings, they 
have the opportunity to present their new learning to the staff, they follow up with district coaches, and use the 
information to drive the PLC meetings that are held weekly.  Several our teachers also
 
completed six S.E.A.L (Social, 
Emotional, and Academic Learning) modules during the course of the year.
