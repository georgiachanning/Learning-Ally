By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
I would like to welcome you to Carmel Elemen
tary's Annual School Accountability Report Card (SARC). In accordance with 
Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual SARC that fulfills state and federal disclosure 
requirements. Parents will find valuable information about 
our academic achievement, professional staff, curricular 
programs, instructional materials, safety procedures, classroom environment, and condition of facilities.
 
 
Carmel Elementary teaches students how to become real leaders by teaching them the 7 Habits 
for Highly Effective People.  
This process is an "inside/out approach" that provides our students a stimulating environment where they are actively 
involved in learning academics, as well as habits to help them succeed in life. Students receive a standards
-
based, 
challenging curriculum by dedicated professional staff and based on the individual needs of the students. Ongoing 
evaluation of student progress and achievement helps us refine the instructional program so students can achieve 
academic proficiency.
 
Our school functions as a Professional Learning Community, where we are constantly seeking the 
best research
-
based strategies to support our students.  In our PLC, we focus on data
-
driven instruction to ensure that our 
students' instruction is differentia
ted for each of them. Together through our hard work, our students will be challenged 
to reach their maximum potential and to "find their voice (Habit 8).
 
 
Carmel Elementary School has received funding to continue as a Lighthouse Leader in Me School where 
we teach 
leadership skills to each of our students based on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as taught by Dr. Steven Covey.  
As a Lighthouse School, we have been distinguished as one of the strongest Leader in Me Schools across the country.  Each 
ye
ar we train our students to be leaders by teaching them to be proactive (I'm in charge of my words, actions, and choices), 
begin with the end in mind (have a plan for their life), put first things first (work first then play), think win
-
win (develop 
relati
onships where everyone can win), seek first to understand, then to be understood (listen with your head, your heart, 
and your ears), synergize (together is better), and sharpen the saw (balance feels best).
 
 
SCHOOL MISSION STATEMENT: Carmel Elementary Scho
ol mission is:
 
 
LEADing our students toward greatness with:
 
L  lifelong learning
 
E  expectations of excellence
 
A  countability
 
D  etermination
 
 
SCHOOL VISION STATEMENT:
 
By sharing and discovering our own voice we will inspire others to find 
theirs.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES AND SAFETY
 
Carmel Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through 
proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. Original facilities were built in 1994; ongoing maintenance and modernization ensure the campus provides 
adequate space for students and staff. Two portable classrooms and a new student restroom were ad
ded to the campus 
during the 2005
-
06 school year to accommodate growth in enrollment. The campus is comprised of the following:
 
 
Acreage = 10
 
Square footage = 60,806
 
Number of permanent classrooms = 21
 
Number of portable classrooms = 15
 
Number of 
restrooms (student use) = 2 sets (2
-
boy; 2
-
girl)
 
S.T.E.A.M. Lab = 1
 
Cafeteria = 1
 
Library = 1
 
Parent Teacher Room/Music room = 1 (one of the current existing portable classrooms)
 
Outside quad area = 1
 
Staff workroom/lounge = 1
 
Health office = 1
 
 
CAMPUS SUP
ERVISION As students arrive on campus in the morning, proctors supervise students in the bus and student 
drop off areas. During recess, teachers are on the playground to monitor behavior and playground activities. At the end 
of the day, teachers escort stu
dents to after
-
school/on
-
campus programs, the bus area, and the student pickup area. 
Teachers and administrators remain in the departure areas to ensure all students have left campus in a safe and orderly 
manner.

CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The custodial staff and
 
district's maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. One full
-
time day custodian, 
one full
-
time evening custodian, and on
e part
-
time evening custodian are assigned to Carmel Elementary and work closely 
with the principal and assistant principal for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events. The principal
 
and custodians communicate daily and follow weekl
y and monthly schedules for cleaning, maintenance, and special 
projects/events preparation. The Day Lead Custodian meets with the principal every Monday morning in a regularly 
scheduled office meeting.  Every morning before school begins the day custodian 
inspects facilities for safety hazards or 
other conditions that need attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism 
are removed prior to students arriving to school. The evening custodians clean classrooms
, desks, and restrooms, and are 
responsible for set up and take down of equipment and/or furniture for afternoon and evening events, and other projects 
as needed.
 
 
Carmel Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance and Operations (M & O) for l
arger projects, routine 
facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. Maintenance and Operations employs a work order process that 
enables Carmel Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. 
Emerg
ency situations are regularly resolved in one hour or less.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Ty
pically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

s calculated by taking the total 
number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The 
number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, t
he number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level 
percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around the California State Content 
Standards and Frameworks and are research
-
based.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and 
concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the district 
and school site. Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities based upon individual 
student needs, school site plans, and the districts designa
ted focus areas. Supplemental training involving curriculum, 
teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of reading/language arts and math were provided at site 
request via Coordinator of Staff Development and Academic Coaches.
 
 
Supplementa
l training topics were selected by the principal, assistant principal, and Staff Council. Training programs and 
topics were chosen based upon the school focus and student needs. Results for the California Standardized Tests and 
district single assessments,
 
teacher feedback, and findings from classroom observations help identify areas for 
improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based 
education fostering student success and proficiency.
 
 
The 
district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supplemental professional development is offered throughout 
the school year on ear
ly student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff development topics and 
focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the district's Professional Development Committee, 
Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey resul
ts. The Professional Development Committee meets four times a year to 
review student test results from state and district assessments and review teacher survey needs. The Principals' 
Roundtable provides opportunities for school principals to discuss and sh
are training needs based upon data analysis and 
classroom observations from each school site.
 
 
New teachers receive intensive support and training through the district's Induction Program and New Teachers Academy. 
For beginning and out
-
of
-
state teachers, t
he district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Beginning 
Teacher Support and Assessment), a statewide and state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing support and skill 
building through formative assessment and individualized suppor
t based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to support year
-
round hiring practices; the orientation is a 
comprehensive overview of the district's policies, school law, English language learners support,
 
curriculum, instruction, 
and grade
-
level and content area specialties.
