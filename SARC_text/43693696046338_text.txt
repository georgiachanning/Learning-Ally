By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, 
safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the district office.
 
 
Sheppard School was 
built in 1962. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field Act requirements of the 
State Building Code with a focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead containing building materials 
are found, they are removed accordi
ng to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, and Local requirements. 

and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
School facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient classroom, office, library
, 

program. The 
Alum Rock Union Elementary School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night 
custodians, ensure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules 
ensure that classrooms, lavatories, 
serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and 
staff use. Regular oversight by district maintenance crews ensures that grass and landscaped areas are well maintained, 

y areas are safe for use.

In June of 2012, through the collaborative work between the District and City of San Jose, Sheppard was the first school 
in the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District to have an all
-
weather track, football, and soccer field that the school 
and community have been actively using to promote health, exercise, and school and community events. Most recently, 
Nvidia's Project Inspire make

international landm
arks are just a few ways our school reflects our students bright futures!
 
 
Our ELAC team is busy renovating our library and a proposal for our College and Career Research Center is underway!

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sheppard Middle School has a very detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and 
procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains the 
yearly safety goals determined by the students, 
staff, and parents. The School Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the year with all staff. Safety alerts ar
e 
shared with all staff as needed throughout the school year.
 
 
The Sheppard School 
Safety Committee updates the plan before it is presented to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School 
District Board of Trustees for annual approval. The revised plan was last approved in February 2014. The School Safety 
Plan has a comprehensive, enforceable, 
and continuous behavior policy, set of rules and regulations, dress code policy, 
set of protocols for safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral policy, non
-
discriminatory policy on 
student rights and responsibilities, campus securi
ty policy, harassment policy, conflict management policy, Internet safety 
policy, and an intervention policy.
 
 
The Safety Plan is revised and approved annually. In addition, there is before and after school supervision as well as 
coverage during brunch and
 
lunch time. A school resource officer is on campus Monday through Friday. All visitors must 
report to the main office upon arrival in order to maintain the safety of our campus.
