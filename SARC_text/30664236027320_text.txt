By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
James Guinn School opened in 1962 and serves students in grades pre
-
K through 6. About
 
fifty
-
five percent of our students 
walk to school from neighboring houses and apartments while the remainder of
 
our students are transported several 
miles to school from central Anaheim. Almost three
-
quarters of our students receive free/reduced lunches.
 
Approximately 
sixty
 
percent of our students are English learners (EL).
 
 
Guinn is a welcoming and supportive scho

all learning and growing. Our diverse population includes children from homes where over a dozen different languages 
are spoken. Thus, students represent a wide range of cultural
 
and ethnic backgrounds. Students are quite varied 
academically and physically, too. It is common to see special education students playing alongside general education 
students. In some classrooms, general education students with special needs and with one
-
to
-
one instructional assistants 
work in groups with their general education classmates. The diversity at Guinn allows us to learn from each other.
 
 
Guinn provides a rigorous and challenging instructional program that reflects high expectations for all stu
dents. We are 
focused on students meeting and exceeding mastery of state standards and helping all students become proficient in their 
grade level expectations. Instructional practices are well
-
planned and include engaging and interactive activities 
approp
riate to students' developmental levels that support the achievement of every student in our school. Coordinated 
support services are provided to students who are not yet proficient, including intervention during the school day and/or 
after school. Assessm
ent is a natural and ongoing part of the instructional process as it facilitates improvement in teaching 
and learning. A variety of supplementary programs and services ensure student success. Library/computer lab programs, 
health services, breakfast and lu
nch programs, and an after
-
school program, Anaheim Achieves, are available at Guinn. 
Additional student activities include 6th Grade Outdoor Science Education and Student Council.
 
 
The mission of James Guinn School, in partnership with the home and our com
munity, is to support the personal and 
intellectual success of every student. Our vision is to ensure that each student learns, achieving high levels of proficiency
 
and beyond.

General
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that a
ll schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the District 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient service. Emerge
ncy 
repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus once every week. No 
emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
 
The District has standard cleaning procedures and guide
lines used at each school site. Cleaning schedules are developed 
jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since January of 2006, the District has 

, once every 10 months all schools are being deep 
cleaned on a rotation schedule.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State 
University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
