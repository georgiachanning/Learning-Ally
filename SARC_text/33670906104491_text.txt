By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sky Country continues to be a part of the AVID network of schools. As a member of the network, Sky Country believes that 
every student deserves the chance to be educated in a way that prepare
s them for college and/or career. Our teachers 
and staff encourage every child to set goals that will allow them to reach their dreams and work toward their future as 
they prepare for college and career. In 2019, we will expand on the philosophy of AVID el
ementary school with an even 
stronger focus on college and career readiness and 21st
-
century learning by extending trainings to more teachers.

Chromebook device. Devices are a part of daily instruction and are checked out to students for in
-
school and at
-
home use. 
Chromebooks are an integral part of daily instruction and curriculum and support the current Units of study. Teachers and 
selected c
lassified staff have begun attending staff development opportunities to learn how to implement effective 
instructional programs including Office 365, Google Apps for Education and other relevant programs. Parents will be 
provided with information on techno
logy and learning opportunity classes throughout the year as well.
 
 
Our district and school initiatives are closely related. As a school, we are working toward full implementation of the 

-
created units specifically c
over the California standards for ELA,  Mathematics, and 
NGSS for each grade level. Daily English Language Development (ELD) continues to be a key area of focus this school year. 
Every classroom provides integrated and designated ELD using the new ELD stan
dards. In 2016, teachers began using the 
new ELA textbook (McGraw Hill 

 
Wonders) to support the Units of Study. The Units continue to serve as our curriculum 
but teachers are given the freedom to use appropriate resources at their discretion.
 
 
 
Vision
 
All
 
Sky Country School students will be academically successful and master the challenging common core state standards.  
Students will develop their individual potential and self
-
worth to become successful, contributing citizens who take full 
responsibilities
 
for their actions.  Students will be respectful, responsible and safe.
 
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
The Sky Country staff is committed to creating a school that knows no limits to the academic success of each student. 
Teachers provide challenging 
lessons reflecting current research, best practices, and high expectations. Sky Country 
Elementary is an AVID School which takes pride in maintaining a student
-
focus for all activities and programs. Teachers 
help to develop connections between life experie
nces and the curriculum. Staff and parents work together to develop the 
academic, social, emotional, and physical well
-
being of all students.

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The r
eview process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, t
he adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is wi
th the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the cor
e curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students rece
ive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of schoo
l have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of our school facilities are a priority for the District. Overall, school grounds and 
facilities are in good repair. The Districts Deferred Maintenance Plan is a
ssessed and updated every year.  Work generated 
by the Deferred Maintenance Plan is generally completed during the summer months. Fire inspections are conducted on 
an annual basis. The District also has an internal inspection team conducting annual safety 
inspections of all sites.
 
 
There have been a few improvements and maintenance projects completed this year.  This summer fences wer put up so 
that we would be separated fro the P.I.CO offices as well as gating was put up to separate the restrooms from the 
campus. 
Room 12 had a wall replaced and treated for water damage.  Rooms 28 and 29 were converted to one room and a restroom 
and water fountain were installed to accommodate our New Preschool Program.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sky Country has three certificated School Site Safety Committee members. The safety plan focuses on daily safety 
measures, emergency safety 
procedures, evacuation instructions and risk management. An active committee is crucial to 
ensuring a relevant and consistent safety education and emergency readiness training program on a campus. The job of 
the committee is to ensure that all staff member
s are informed and that emergency preparedness and school site safety 
does not slip through the cracks amid the everyday urgencies that arise daily on a school campus. The plan is revisited 
every March and approved during a school site council meeting. The
 
school site council is responsible for developing the 
school site safety plan or for delegating the responsibility to a School Safety Committee. The committee most recently 
reviewed procedures with the staff in March 2019  after the Great ShakeOut drill. 
Monthly drills also occur on campus 
including fire drills, lockdown and earthquake drills.

Based on SBAC assessment data, mathematics continues to be a professional development focus. Students are continually 
showing lack of knowledge in basic math facts/fluency. To address this concern, all TK
-
6 teachers attended  Balanced Math 
training with an
 
emphasis on math fluency (Math FUN). Fluency using numbers (FUN) is incorporated into daily math 
instruction by providing students with a conceptual understanding using games and periodic fact checks in order to help 
them with their overall math applicati
on.
 
 
Primary intervention is also a focus for students in grades kindergarten through third. DIBELS data is used to identify 
students who need intensive intervention for foundation reading skills. Primary intervention teachers and k
-
3 teachers 
receive PD o
n effective instructional strategies to help all students read at grade level by third grade. PD is offered by a 
district teacher on special assignment and a county consultant. Training is offered during the day with subs provided. 
Some training are specif

meeting in September of last year.
 
 
The Next Generation Science Standards are being implemented. During the first trimester, all teachers attended an al
l
-
day PD to get an overview of the plan and to see where the new units could be accessed. Teachers are required to 
implement units throughout the year.
 
 
Technology professional development is offered multiple times throughout the year on various topics pro
vided by our 
technology staff and district teachers and coaches. Teachers can sign up on the days of their choice and subs are provided. 
Topics such as Haiku and Google are options. Trainings are hands
-
on and provide information on technology integration 
i

During the 16
-
17 and 17
-
18 school year, nine district coaches are available for teachers to contact for topics of their choice. 
Teachers can meet with
 
them during the day, with subs provided, or after school at their discretion. Coaches can provide 
professional development to groups of teachers, whole staffs or individual teachers.
 
 
The site principal, coaches(16

teachers in the implementation of all district 
initiatives. Coaching, reflection and discussion are part of the process to help staff members refine their skills and provid
e
