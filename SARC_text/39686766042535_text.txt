Quest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and
 
the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet 
access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first

served basis. Other use res
trictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding For
mula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and loc
al priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, p
arents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those boo
ks are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbook
s used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Our school places a strong emphasis o

close of school
, either during 
the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and 
district personnel to resolve 
the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and dis
trict emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was recently reviewed by the School Site Council in October 2018, helps to provide 
a secure
, peaceful and 

ergencies and natural 
disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure 
students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Campus Security Assistants, yard duty supervisors, 
teachers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is s
afe for all st
udents. Security 
cameras were installed last year and assist with safety and security of students and staff.  All visitors must sign in at the
 
office and receive proper 
authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all times.
