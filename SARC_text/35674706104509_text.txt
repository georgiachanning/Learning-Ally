School Description
 
The Calaveras School community is located in
 
the city of Hollister on Buena Vista Road, sitting in 
the middle of orchard land on one side and the school neighborhood on the other. Hollister sits in 
northern San Benito County where it is only 47 miles from the San Jose metropolitan area, 39 miles 
eas
t of the Monterey Peninsula, and 90 miles south of San Francisco. The region still retains the 
agricultural and cattle ranching ambiance of its heritage.  The campus is shared with the 
Accelerated Achievement Academy, a separate magnet school for gifted an
d high achieving 4th
-
8th grade students in the county.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year Calaveras Elementary School served over 500 students from 
transitional kindergarten through eighth grade. Demographics report that 63% of the students are 
English langua
ge learners and that 85% of the students come from low income families.
 
 
Our mission statement became a living document where the staff dedicated itself to "enlighten, 
engage and educate all learners in a safe and nurturing environment so they will be succ
essful 
thinkers and contributors to society.  This will be accomplished through research
-
based instruction, 
family participation and a partnership with the community."  We know that all children can learn 
at high levels. At Calaveras School we know our stu
dents by name and by need.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a pri
mary concern at Calaveras School. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations, including those 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for 
ensuring stude
nt and staff 
safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held every other month, and secure
 
campus drills are conducted 
annually. Teachers and staff receive information at monthly safety meetings. The School S
afety Committee is a part of the School Leadership Team, and 
the school has representation on the District Safety Committee.
 
 
The School Site Council updates the Comprehensive Safety Plan annually. This year it was approved in June of 2019. Copies of 
the s
afety plan are shared 
by law with the district office, local officials, law enforcement, and are available for review. The school campus is complet
ely secured by fencing, and all 
visitors to the campus are required to sign in at the office and display a vi
sitors badge at all times. Supervision is provided for students throughout the 
school day. The responsibility is shared between the administration, school staff and yard supervisors.
