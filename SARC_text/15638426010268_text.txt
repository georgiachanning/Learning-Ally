About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sc
hool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Thomas Jefferson Middle School (TJMS) provides
 
a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and parents. The school provides an appropriate 
learning environment for students and staff. There are approximately 40 classrooms. Additionally, there's a site library and 
gymnasium for other learning 
opp
ortunities.  There are yard supervisors on campus before the first bus arrives to ensure student safety. Only students are al
lowed to enter the campus. 

 
while on campus. The badge is created only after a 
visitor is registered into the school's Raptor System which essentially serves as a digital scanner that is tied to the natio
nal database of sex offenders. 
(This system will notify us to deny entry.)
 
 
Bre
akfast is served to all students who desire to eat before school/classes begin.  A total of nine part
-
time yard supervisors as well as one full
-
time 
campus monitor meet with administration on a regular basis to discuss any pending issues related to student
 
safety. The school facility provides ample 
classroom and playground space, office space, and multiple well
-
equipped staff resource rooms. TJMS has implemented the Safe Schools Ambassador 
Program on campus to support students and staff on the prevention of
 
bullying to create a safer school environment. Our playground includes eight 
outside basketball courts, six volleyball courts, a soccer field, and four baseball/softball fields. A team of three full
-
time custodians and three part
-
time 
custodians work on a
 
daily basis to ensure classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe.
 
 
The table below shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection. All facilities are inspected regularly to 
ensure that they are well
-
maintained and
 
in good repair. Work orders are processed promptly to ensure efficient service, and urgent repairs are given the highest prio
rity. At the 
time this report was compiled, 87.65% percent of campus facilities were in proper working order.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement 
(Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Thomas Jefferson Middle School (TJMS) takes great pride in
 
developing a partnership between school and community. We value parent input and 
encourage communication between school and home. All parents are welcome to attend meetings with the administration at any ti
me to discuss 
concerns and/or topics of interest.
 
Two committees by which information is shared with parents is the School Site Council (SSC) and English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC). During these monthly meetings, school administration trains all members on current data from local
 
and state assess
ments. 
Information regarding teacher professional development (PD), funding sources, and support services for students is also share
d.
 
 
In addition, the administration disseminates information on a regular basis via web page, monthly newsletter/calendar, m
arquee, and phone calls/texts.  
Information includes; school's instructional focus, expectations for staff & students, overview of student programs & service
s, and parent 
involvement/training opportunities.
 
 
Administration shares and seeks input from stake
holders with regards to the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA goals include 
extended learning focused on intervention and enrichment classes for all students.  All PD for teachers and administration is
 
based on needs assessments 
and data
 
results with an overall focus on research based learning strategies and best practices. Administration also meets with parent
s on SSC and ELAC 
to review and evaluate the SPSA.  In addition, administration solicits input from the parents on these committee
s. Copies of annual School Accountability 
Report Cards (SARC) are made available to parents promptly after its publication (in English & Spanish). Teachers update ABI 
(Parent Portal) regularly to 

 
academic grades, attendance, and test results.
 
 
Emphasis is placed on increasing parent involvement through Parent University Nights with topics of interest and need.  Schoo
l also communicates with 
parent/home via; daily use of student planners, 
teacher
-
to
-
parent communication, mailing of progress grade reports, community outreach liaison 
communication, and/or AERIES communication.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The 
School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in December 2019. California Education C
ode requires the 
preparation of comprehensive safe school plans dealing with violence prevention, emergency preparedness, crisis in
tervention, and student and staff 
safety.
 
 
The following Education Code sections detail some of the requirements for a Comprehensive School Safety Plan, specifically se
ction 35294.11 (b)(1) 
indicating that the school site council will write and develop a c
omprehensive school safety plan relevant to the needs and resources of that particular 
school. California Education Code section 35294.11 (2) provides that the school site council may delegate this responsibility
 
to a school safety planning 
committee. The 
administration at Thomas Jefferson forms a Safe School Committee to revise the plan annually. Members of the committee includ
ed 
parents, classified and certificated staff, students, and law enforcement. The committee is required to include the following
 
in
 
the development of the 
School Safety Plan:
 
 

 
assessing the current status of school crime
 

 
identifying appropriate strategies & programs to promote school safety and address the school

s procedures for complying with existing laws 
related to school saf
ety, such as:
 
o

The district and site PD is selected and/or developed based on needs/deficiencies and focused on addressing CCSS and closing 
the achievement gap. 
Some specific needs WUESD has identified include Direct 
Instruction, English Language Development, ELD strategies, writing across the curriculum, and 
direct vocabulary instruction. All professional development is researched based. One staff meeting per month has been given a
s teacher time to analyze 
student dat
a. From the data team meetings, teachers have the opportunity to analyze data, plan for reteaching, and discuss best practice
s. To better 
support at
-
risk students in the Response to Interventions (RTI) process, PD is provided to assist /support teachers on
 
effective and research based 
interventions. Our implementation of the California Common Core State Standards has also given us the opportunity to provide 
extensive training to 
teachers on CCSS.
 
 
Prior to the start of each school year and throughout eh yea
r, WUESD provides 2
-
5 days of professional development (PD). These full days of professional 
development include the following topics: Data Teams (PLCs), Classroom Management, Integrated AVID Strategies (i.e., WICOR), 
Interim Block 
assessments, etc.
