About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

t included the wiring of all permanent classrooms and offices for Internet 
access, new telephones, new fire alarms, new video/data, the installation of air conditioners, new electrical drops, new ligh

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students

The district provides professional learning opportunities to meet the needs of administrators, teachers, and support staff at
 
all levels of the organization: 
Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment (BTSA); Peer 
Assistance Review (PAR) for veteran teachers; District and site administrators; Teachers and 
support staff; and Digital Learning Coaches.
 
 
Four full days and approximately 20 half days of professional learning are being offered at our school site in the 20
19
-
20 school year. The topics addressed 

-
wide action plans. Our intern teachers are 
supported by university supervisors and Master teachers. Professio
nal development at individual school sites is determined by in
-
depth data analysis 
and aligned to the instructional focus areas. English learners and special population training are offered on
-
site as needed. In addition, teachers and 
support staff also at
tend off
-
site workshops or conferences.
 
 
2018
-
19 Analysis of data led to the identification of professional learning priorities. Whole group instruction, small group diffe
rentiated instruction, and 
designated English language development supported strength
ening language arts instruction at the elementary level. Professional learning in 
mathematics focused on the Standards for Mathematics Practice, in conjunction with problem
-
solving and modeling and data analysis at the middle 
school level. At the high scho
ol, professional learning was prioritized for the Expository Reading and Writing Course which develops students' academic 
literacy in rhetorical and analytical reading, writing, and thinking. All schools participated in professional learning oppor
tunities 
centered on data literacy. 
Professional development is provided during modified day schedules, pupil
-
free days, release days, and conferences/workshops outside the district. 
Professional learning is supported through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal me
etings, observations, and demonstration lessons.
