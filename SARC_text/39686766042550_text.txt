About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Mater
ials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California conten
t standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and th
eir dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planne
d Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Elmwood School has 38 classrooms, a multipurpose room, an auditorium, a library and an administration center. The Main Buildi
ng consists of 17 
classrooms. There are also 21 portable classrooms to round out the campus.
 
 
Dis
trict maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed 
in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest prior
ity.
 
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are 
well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensur
e a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is a
vailable upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site an
d district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which was revised and approved by the School Site Council in September, 2018, helps to pr

nd 
school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for all students. All visitors
