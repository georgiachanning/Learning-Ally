About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card
 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Pla
n (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For 
more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 
web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and
 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school was built in the early 1960s and underwent a renovation in 2014 to ensure the safety of our young students and exp
and our site parking.  
Buildings and restrooms are clean, well
-
equipped, and in good worki
ng order.  We have a KaBoom playground and a fairly new multipurpose room with 
a cafeteria and student bathrooms.  Our site is currently looking into adding additional shading space and exchanging one of 
our old bungalows for one 
where we can consult and p
rovide support services for students.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public S
chool Construction.

date on safety protocol. Our first Safety Meeting this year was held in October, 2019.
 
 
The key elements to our comprehensive safety plan in
clude classrooms that are up to fire
-
department code, emergency & disaster plans, and clear 
communication protocols for staff and office. Information regarding safety is presented yearly at staff meetings and througho
ut the year. All classrooms 
and student
 
areas are equipped with appropriate communication devices as well as an emergency disaster plan and materials located above f
ire 
extinguishers. Appropriate amounts of food, water, and first
-
aid supplies are stored in a cargo container near evacuation rout
es. A map is displayed in 
all classrooms indicating where students and staff are to meet in case of an emergency. Monthly, school
-
wide drills are conducted to ensure that all are 
best prepared in case of a real emergency.

Understanding that quality teachers play a key role in student achievement, our language immersion site is taking active step
s to provide enriching 
professional development opportunities this year that help enrich the language instruction provided to our s
tudents.  As an immersion site, our staff has 
participated in the following PD: Maravillas Curriculum roll
-
out, Common Core Math Training sessions, and Spanish Common Core Standards (SDCOE).  
Teachers are also developing their professional skills by sharin
g their expertise with other professionals in multiple settings including: CUE Technology 
Conference, Learning Headquarters, and WRITE Institute.
 
 
Through our joint district
-
union Teacher Evaluation, staff is provided a teacher
-
growth model to reflect and 
build on their teaching. Through this process, 
instructional leaders support teachers through formal and informal observations, instructional walk
-
throughs, teacher/admin reflections, and PD support 
is provided in various layers to meet individual teacher 
needs.
 
 
Additionally, our district is committed to weekly PLCs, providing teachers the opportunity to collaborate, analyze data, and 
plan instruction according to 
CCSS and student needs.  Our professional learning and collaborations are driven by various f
ormative & summative assessments and teacher 
observations.
 
 
Across the District:
 
 
SCIENCE 

 
 
The primary areas of focus for staff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation S
cience Standards (NGSS) 
and moving tea
chers and administrators into implementation.  Focus areas include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling up Profession
al Learning 
and Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards,
 
4) Collaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5) Addressing supplemental instructional materials.
 
 
Professional development needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Scien
ce Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedback data collected via prior professional learning events in the distr
ict.
 
 
Professional Learning for the 2019
-
2020 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the dis
trict through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and content training.  This will occur primarily through science lesson study for all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, 
and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
Core Leadership Team and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training in the areas of Leadership, Facilitati
on of Professional Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS 
innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation Initiative Program.  

Teacher Leader peers through 
the establi
shed lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district PD days.
 
Other opportunities for science professional learning include supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional 
Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnershi
p, and instructional material evaluation.
 
 
Administrator professional learning will address NGSS innovations, strategies to identify and support high quality science in
struction (observations and 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both 
on site and through district management meetings via the Early Implementer Initiative.

MATH 

 
 
LUSD focused on mathematics as a professional development goal in response to low performance scores on the CAASPP and to sup
port teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.
 
 
Profe
ssional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways:  1) Workshops (after school, on professional growth da
ys, and during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and small group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
T
eachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and use of curriculum materials through: 1) Workshops focused
 
on the content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math content they teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content 
and practice standards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on unit and lesson design with their curriculum materials (within school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
both in one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups
.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning activities 
and receive additional training from a leadership perspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
Social
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus a
reas in the 19
-
20 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselors continue the work of supporting the social and emotional needs of stude
nts.   Two Behavior Specialists 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support st
udents with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Two MTSS Teachers on Special 
Assignment (TOSAs) were added to support the development of social/emotional/behavioral intervention systems at four of our E
lementary sites.

Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School District continues to support principal growth through Professional Development and has deepened our su
pport of teacher leaders 
in the 2018
-
2019 school year. Teacher leaders (Fac
ilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as content support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Learning. The Facilitators, in turn, provide on
-
site coaching to their respective staffs.

focused education that develops mastery of the Common Core State Standards, Next Generation 
Science standards, target language (Spanish or Mandarin instruction, and 3r
d language enrichment).  In addition, our immersion language program 
provides students the primary target language instruction with 3rd language exposure, thanks to Chinese Interns and Spanish T
eachers who provide an 
average of 30 minutes every week.
 
 
Unde
rstanding the importance of providing our language immersion teachers with the best practices, Unrestricted funding is utiliz
ed to provide 
professional development, and Spanish/Mandarins support resources. In addition, our Unrestricted funding supports art
s integration, and the 7 Keys of 
Excellence Habits program.
 
 
Supplemental funding is utilized to support student interventions for English Learner, and Socio
-
economically disadvantaged students.
 
 
Major contribution to our quality instructional program also
 
comes from family & community donations and fundraisers.  The annual district
-
wide Run 
for the Arts fundraiser provides funding to support the arts in all schools.  Through our site 's annual Jog

Thon, Multicultural Fair, Festival de Otoño, 
and other fu
ndraisers, our PTSA supplements our educational opportunities by paying for high
-
quality assemblies, field trip opportunities, arts 
integration, 7 Keys of Excellence school
-
wide PBIS recognition program, online support intervention programs, target languag
e teaching materials, and 
other classroom/site needs.
 
 
Bond allocations have allowed us to provide the school with technology including: MacBook Pro computers for every teacher, SM
ART Boards, docu
-
cams, 
and wireless access in every classroom, with an added
 
10 iPads for each teacher.
 
 
Aligned with Riverview International Academy (2nd

-
achieving 
trajectory, which has placed our site at or above district, county, and state 
average.  We are a 21st Century school making it happen today!
