About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in goo
d repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every s
tudent, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of 
class sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a 
commitment of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are select
ed and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Ed
ucational Services.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Pathway Elementary sits on 1.5 acres.  There are no current construction projects. The table below shows the results of the s
chool's most recent 
inspection using the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT).  Th
is inspection determines the school facility's good repair status. District maintenance staff ensures 
that repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner.  For all items ins
pected that were found to 
not
 
be in 'good repair', work orders have been created and maintenance will be done before the end of the 2019

des the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. O
nly eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities
); and

parents may contact the teacher or the counselor at any time to check on their child's progress or to discuss needs. The scho
ol holds events for students 
and parents such as Pages with Parents, Veterans Recognition, and the Pathway Car S
how, to enhance parental involvement. Parents may also volunteer 
in the class and on field trips. Translation services are available for parents attending meetings.

School Safety Plan
 
The Site Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually by Pathway staff and the review date for this year took place during Au
gust of 2019.  Necessary 
revisions are made to reflect current iss
ues regarding student and school safety. Pershing School staff is well versed in how to respond to various crisis 
situations that may arise. The School Site Council approved the Plan on October 3, 2019.
 
 
Key Elements of the Site Emergency Response Plan for
 
Pathway include taking a proactive position in school safety by fostering positive relationships 
with students. Our goal is for every student to have a positive relationship with at least 1 adult on campus. Students and st
aff take part in monthly fire 
dri
lls and scheduled earthquake and lockdown drills. Staff is on proactive duty during student breaks and the school grounds are
 
kept clean and attractive.
