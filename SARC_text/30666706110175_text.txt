School Description
 
George Washington Carver Elementary School (Carver Elementary) is located at the corner of West 
Santa Ana Boulevard and North Pacific Avenue. Carver 
Elementary opened in 1991 as a K
-
5 
elementary school. In 1998, the school became a K
-
2 school and in July 1999, it was expanded an 
additional grade level to a TK
-
3 elementary school. This year, Carver Elementary School added a 
grade level and is TK
-
4th gra
de with plans of adding 5th grade for the 2020
-
2021 school year.
 
 
The school's instructional program is structured around Common Core state standards and district 
approved curriculum. Teachers use Benchmark Advance for English language arts and Math 
Expres
sions for mathematics. All English learners participate in a 60
-
minute period of instruction in 
English Language Development (ELD) 
-
 
30 minutes of which are directly interwoven within the 
language arts teaching block and 30 minutes at their designated ELD 
level. To assist with the 
individual growth of our students, Carver is one of the first elementary schools to implement 1:1 
technology in every classroom.  These devices assist teachers with blended learning and aid in 
personalized learning and small group
 
instruction. As a school, we continue to focus on the 
individual growth of each student; taking every student at their own level and growing from there. 
Students who are not proficient in English Language Arts, Math, or English Language Development 
receiv
e support during the school day, as well as before and after school. In addition, we believe 
that extracurricular activities in Visual and Performing arts are an essential component of teaching 
the whole child and developing a love for school.  Every stude
nt on our campus receives weekly 
music instruction from a credentialed music teacher, as well as art instruction, and opportunities 
for on and off site music, theater and drama.
 
 
Carver Elementary is a welcoming and committed learning environment where all
 
students are 
motivated to continue growing and learning. Our core values of respect, responsibility and safety 
are embedded into every school day.  Teachers work collaboratively and have necessary resources 
to offer a clean and safe environment. Competent
 
and caring staff welcome parent involvement. 
There is evidence of mutual trust and respect between district, community and school that all 
stakeholders' input is valued as an integral part of decision making. We offer our students and 
community a kinderga
rten readiness pre
-
school, after
-
school program, parenting classes, Zumba, 
onsite counseling and community worker, as well as  before and after school tutoring services to 
assist in the overall development of their well
-
being. Carver has a licensed nurse o
ne day a week 
that works collaboratively with our school team.
 
 
The mission of Carver Elementary School is to successfully educate all students through high 
expectations, a commitment to excellence, and equal access to a comprehensive program, 
emphasizing 
the belief that all students will learn and become responsible, literate, thinking and 
contributing members of society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan

the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closel
y as a team and with the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins,
 
the custodian and principal inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

use of 
chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards 
and prioritization procedures 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of clas
srooms, office areas, and restrooms. Groundskeepers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which i
ncludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleve
n. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabili
ties); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study
