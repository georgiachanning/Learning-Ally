By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our impressiv
e media center hosts Rancho students, who visit the library once a week. The library media specialist 
provides library and research skills as well as the opportunity for all students to check out books. In a typical month, 
students and staff check out more
 
than 3,000 books from our collection of more than 14,000 titles. Students and the 
community may also access the library before and after school. 
 
 
Rancho has fifteen Chromebook carts, which contain 450 Chromebooks that are shared among the students. Our m

, and document cameras. Every classrooms has audio amplification systems. 
 
 
Physical fitness has become a main focus throughout our campus, including our quarter
-
mile long, 6 foot wide grit covered 
track that supports our Rancho Running Club and our Projec
t Fit America fitness equipment, which challenges our students 
with fitness throughout the day.
 
 
 
We received this state

padding. Our multipurpose room is equipped 
with a climbing wall that classes are able to use. Rancho received 3 beautiful 

School of the Year in 2009. All students receive a minimum of 200
 
minutes of PE every 10 days.
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore have passed three major funding measures targeting school facilit
y needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous and supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond. Measure J funds will be used to:
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs and educational technol
ogy for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, includ
ing security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to school facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities

Thr
ough these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan. Facilities are maintained through the diligent efforts of the site custodial cr
ews 
and the district
 
maintenance staff. The LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
LVJUSD. The principal works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to maintain clean and safe schools. 
District maintenance staff perfor
ms the repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely manner. 
A work

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Livermore Valley 
Joint Unified School District (LVJUSD) values active parent engagement and believes that parent 

recognizes that parents/guardians are their
 

involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school 
environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with staff and 
parents/guardians to develop meaningful 
opportunities at all grade levels for parents/guardians to be involved in district and school activities; advisory, decision
-
making, and advocacy roles; and activities to support learning at home. Educational researc
h suggests that highly effective 
schools have a number of features in common, including high levels of parent and community involvement. When parents 

-
roun
ded educational 
experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school community. There are a range of opportunities for 
parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports 
and ac
tivity booster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly basis, the superintendent of schools meets with a 

gathering provides an oppo
rtunity for parent groups to collaborate with each other and representatives of the district 
regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families. This is also a time district representatives share
 
new initiatives and current informati
on with parent leaders. In addition, parents have the opportunity to share general 
concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also has formal advisory groups including School 
Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Com
mittees (ELACs) who represent other parents at the site and are 
critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each 
SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Adv
isory Committee, and a member of each ELAC serves 
on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory 
Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and engagement, parents,district, 
and school staff have 
open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Parents play an integral role in decisions made at Rancho. We have a very active Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and 
our parents 
support the school with fundraisers, family nights, schoolwide assemblies and celebrations. The PTA supports 
Rancho with more than $20,000 in direct donations in addition to supporting field trips and classroom donations.
 
 
Parents serve on our School Site 
Council (SSC), helping to make program and budget decisions for our school. Parent 
volunteers help in the classrooms by providing additional assistance with reading and math. Each week on Tuesday, 
Wednesday and Thursday, parents are at the track assisting 
with our Running Club. In addition, parents, grandparents, 
and retired teachers provide support with our literacy program, helping students learn to read. Parents also support our 
(GATE) gifted and talented education activities.Following our monthly Family
 
Fitness Day, the PTA hosts a Coffee Corner 
for parents to meet and discuss school issues informally with each other and the principal. For information on how to be 
involved in the school, contact PTA President Kristin Lendzion at rlppresident@gmail.com.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Rancho, in conjunction with our District and PTA, provides our students with a
 
welcoming campus that is clean and in 
great condition. Staff, students and parent volunteers pride themselves on the gardening projects and maintenance of 
decorative planters and informational bulletin boards throughout the campus. With the help of the Ra
ncho community, 
we have resurfaced and painted the blacktop areas, constructed a quarter
-
mile running track, added backpack hooks 
outside each classroom, and painted murals on several outside walls. A visual survey of the grounds at Rancho shows a 
sense of
 
community and a great deal of pride in  our school. Rancho maintains an ongoing commitment to safety, health, 
and environmental  programs. Rancho staff reviews the school safety plan annually to ensure all classrooms are up
-
to
-
date on procedures. All teac
hers have emergency backpacks located in the classroom. It was most recently reviewed, 
updated, and discussed with the school faculty in August 2019. Visitors are required to check in at the  office and wear 
identification stickers. Adults supervise the pl
ayground and field at all recesses and the multipurpose room at lunchtime. 
A student safety patrol (valet) assists with the safe unloading of students before school. Fire, earthquake, and intruder 
drills are conducted on a regular basis, as mandated by our
 
District and State. Certificated and classified staff have 
completed CPR training. We stock emergency tubs for each class and house them in our emergency container with other 
emergency safety tools. Student recycling assistants, cafeteria helpers and rain
y
-
day lunch monitors, combined with the 
above programs, create a clean and safe environment at Rancho.

influences the opportunities for 
students to achieve at the highest levels. In line with our District Professional Development Plan, we offer and support 
ongoing growth opportunities that allow every teacher, administrator, and 
staff member to further develop the 
appropriate knowledge, skills, and practices required to create learning environments that allow all students to 
demonstrate high levels of achievement. Our Board of Education and our district administration recognize th
at all staff 
members of the LVJUSD must be provided time and support to acquire, improve, and enhance professional knowledge, 
practices, and skills.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, relevant and timely professional development will be available and deliv
ered to 
employees. In addition, two designated professional development days and the flexible professional development day for 
certificated staff provide the option of individualized professional growth for teachers. Professional development will 
primarily
 
focus on effective tier one instruction; Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), student and staff 
safety; customer service; meeting the needs of students with Individual Education Plans (IEP); effective usage of 
technology as an instructiona
l tool; effective instructional practices for English learners; and implementation of specialized 
programs such as Dual Immersion, Project Lead the Way, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced Placement programs.
