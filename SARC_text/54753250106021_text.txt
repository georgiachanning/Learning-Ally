As
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
growth
 
process,
 
opportunities
 
for
 
training
 
and

development
 
are
 
provided
 
at
 
both
 
the
 
district
 
level
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
individual
 
school
 
site
 
for
 
administrators,
 
teachers,
 
and
 
classified
 
staff.
 
The
 
district
 
offers
 
three
 
staff
 
development
 
days
 
annually
 
where
 
staff
 
members
 
are
 
offered
 
professional
 
growth
 
opportunities
 
in
 
curriculum,
 
teaching
 
strategies,
 
and
 
methodologies.
 
Our
 
focus
 
this
 
year
 
has
 
been
 
literacy
 
and
 
math.
 
We
 
are
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
Tulare
 
County
 
Office
 
of
 
Education
 
(TCOE)
 
to
 
provide
 
ongoing
 
coaching
 
and
 
mentoring
 
opportunities
 
in
 
Literacy,
 
ELD,
 
Math
 
and
 
NGSS.
  
We
 
have
 
also
 
hired
 
an
 
Academic
 
Coach
 
last
 
year
 
to
 
provide
 
additional
 
coaching
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
Our
 
instructional
 
coaches
 
have
 
provided
 
demo
 
lessons
 
in
 
the
 
classrooms
 
and
 
have
 
attended
 
PLC
 
meetings
 
to
 
support
 
instructional
 
practices.
 
In
 
an
 
effort
 
to
 
support
 
technology
 
in
 
the
 
classroom
 
and
 
enhance
 
student
 
engagement
 
strategies
 
in
 
the
 
classroom,
 
certificated
 
and
 
classified
 
staff
 
have
 
received
 
training
 
in
 
Google
 
and
 
Kagan
 
engagement
 
strategies.
 
All
 
of
 
our
 
teachers
 
have
 
a
 
Chrome
 
Cart
 
in
 
their

are

(i.e.
