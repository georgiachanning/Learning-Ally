About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The 
District provides or coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for Califo
rnia, District 
iReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding specific needs. Professional development is aligned with the Dis
trict Strategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators partici
pate in workshops, and conferences that allow them to 
grow professionally and provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathema
tics, reading intervention 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching suppo
rt full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as
 
the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignm
ent and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learn
ing, 21st Century 
Classroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal D
esign for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day works
hops, after
-
school workshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers i
n the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the District calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
