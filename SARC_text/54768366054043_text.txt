About the SARC
 
By Februar
y 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding
 
Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and
 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the schoo
l, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our school and district transitioned to the Common Core State Standards during the 2013
-
14 school ye
ar. We have not officially adopted new core 
curriculum since our previous adoptions listed below, with the exception of Grades TK
-
5 in English
-
language arts. We have contracted with our local 
Tulare County Office of Education and developed Units of Study i
n English
-
language Arts (ELA) and Math. Many grade levels utilize materials from our 
current ELA adoption, and both our previous ELA and History
-
Social Science adoptions for these ELA units. For our math units, we have used materials 
from EngageNY, Georgia
 
Units from the Georgia Department of Education, Illustrative Mathematics, North Carolina Mathematics, and YouCubed. In 
2016, we piloted and adopted Wonders (McGraw Hill Education) ELA curriculum for Kindergarten and Transitional Kindergarten. A
dditionally
, we 
purchased two supplemental programs from Voyager Sopris Learning in August 2016 for reading intervention: Read Well (Grades K
-
3) and Language! 
Live (Grades 4
-
5). In 2017, we adopted Wonders (McGraw Hill Education) ELA curriculum for Second Grade. In 2
018, we adopted Wonders (McGraw Hill 
Education) ELA curriculum for grades 1, 3, 4, and 5.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
