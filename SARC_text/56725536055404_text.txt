20120 school year, Dos Caminos has enrolled approximately 350 students in our 
Preschool through Fifth grade classrooms, including Special Day classrooms in grades Kindergarten 
through 2nd grade.
 
 
Dos Caminos continues to benefit from Title 
I funds which provide for instructional assistants and 
credentialed teachers to assist in the classroom with added small group instruction and ELD support 
for our second language learners. Our Title 1 Teachers and Title 1 funded Instructional Assistants 
wo
rk to create one

on
-
one and small group environments for our students.  Teachers work closely 
with our Title 1 Teachers to design lessons specifically targeted to meet the needs of our students.  
Furthermore, our 3rd 
-
5th grade students have started the AV
ID program this year at Dos Caminos.
 
 
Dos Caminos continues to focus on engaging, standards aligned lessons that utilize the latest in 
educational technology.  Dos Caminos offers its students a Makerspace classroom plus a fully 
functioning library.  Additi
onally, every Kindergarten through 2nd grade classroom is provided with 
at least 6 student iPads.  Furthermore, we have a 1:1 ratio in 1st through 5th grade of Chromebooks 
to students.  Students at Dos Caminos are creating, collaborating, communicating, an
d thinking 
critically using technology.
 
 
Dos Caminos has continued its efforts to teach about wellness to our students. Each classroom has 
been furnished a planter box to teach students about the educational and personal rewards of 
gardening of plants rang
ing from vegetables to drought tolerant California native plants. We also 
have a recycling program and an outdoor classroom to enable students to learn and create in 
outdoor environment.
 
 
DCS Vision Statement: Excellence for all.
 
DCS Mission Statement: Dos

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information 
about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they inte
nd to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirement
s, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Instructional Materials (School Year 2019

The school district held a public hearing on 
October 17, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
E
nglish learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed b
y the California Department of Education, making the textbooks 
used in the school the most current available.  Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a re
commendation is made to 
the School Board by a selection committee co
mposed of teachers and administrators.  All recommended materials are available for parent examination 
at the district office prior to adoption.

Parent Involvement
 
 
Dos Caminos offers a variety of opportunities for parent involvement. First and foremost, we have a thriving PTA that facilit
ates a number of activities 
for our stude
nts and families. Our PTA has approximately 150 members who help the school by raising funds to support programs, fund field 
trips, and 
provide supplemental resources. This year, we have invited parents to such events as Movie Nights, Game Nights, monthly 
PTA meetings and more. 
Parents are also invited to attend a variety of parent education events, Back
-
to
-
School Night, and Open House. In addition, our School Site Council and 
ELAC (English Language Advisory Committee) provide parent support and ongoing dec
ision making regarding important items that affect our campus. 
Furthermore, we have family fundraiser nights that bring families together at local restaurants. Parents attend field trips, 
volunteer regularly on site, and 
are an important part of our Dos Ca
minos community. An on
-
site translator assists with conferences or other communication needs for our Spanish 
speaking families. And, with the rise of social media, we are also reaching out to our parents though a PTA Facebook page, In
stagram, and Twitter, 
as 
well as our Dos Caminos Web Site.
