By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-

School Vision and Mission:
 
The vision of Natoma Station Elementary School is to encourage lifelong learning, to help students reach their full 
potential, and to teach students to make positive contributions to their 
community. A focus on building positive 
relationships amongst staff and students to promote lifelong self
-
efficacy through an emphasis on culture, climate, 
coherence and maximizing student engagement will help build a school where students and staff grow a
nd learn together.
 
 
Natoma Station embraces the Folsom Cordova Unified District's vision statement which states:
 
Guided by the highest expectations, Natoma Station and the Folsom Cordova Unified School District provides our students 
with a broad range of r
igorous educational opportunities. Staff enables students to reach their full potential and 
successfully meet the demands and opportunities of a highly technological 21st Century.
 
 
By focusing on the foundational school years through grades kindergarten th
rough fifth, Natoma Station Elementary will 
start students on the path so that they can eventually graduate with a core of knowledge and skills that become the 
building blocks for lifelong learning. They graduate with a positive attitude and the leadership
, character, and academic 
skills necessary to excel in a global arena. Families are an integral part of the educational process. In recognition of this
 
important role, at Natoma Station family involvement is actively sought, encouraged, and welcomed.
 
 
Busi
ness and community partnerships greatly enhance students' learning experiences and educational opportunities. 
Partnerships offer students opportunities to apply their learning to real
-
world situations. At Natoma Station, the 
administration and staff active
ly seek community partnerships in order to enhance and amplify students' educational 
experiences.
 
 
Schools serve as community hubs, places where the community gathers to celebrate and improve learning and to enjoy 
art, music, sports, public speaking, drama, and other school
-
related activities. The use of school facilities by the community 
at Natoma Stat
ion is encouraged. School facilities are a reflection of the entire community. We provide students with the 
educational tools to meet the technological demands of the future and the social skills to function in a culturally diverse 
society.

-
2020 school 
year, just over 500 students were enrolled in grades preschool through fifth. The school's gender distribut
ion is roughly 
equal, with boys and girls. The school's largest ethnic group is White, with 49% of the school population describing 
themselves as White. In terms of racial subgroups, significant numbers include Asian at 26%, and Hispanic at 13%. Natoma 
Sta
tion Elementary School has approximately 30 students enrolled in our special education self
-
contained programs which 
provide additional support for our students with disabilities. Natoma Station has been recognized by the California State 
Department of Edu
cation as a California Distinguished School. In May, 2001, the U.S. Department of Education named 
Natoma Station a 2000
-
2001 National Blue Ribbon School. While it has been many years since Natoma Station was 
awarded these titles, our staff has not deviated
 
from a vision that continues to strive for excellence in school leadership, 
teaching practices, student learning outcomes, and parental and community involvement.
 
 
Natoma Station has a spacious and beautifully manicured campus with a highlight being an in
viting and magnificent rose 
garden. It is a true neighborhood school, with a majority of students living within walking distance. The primary goal of 
Natoma Station Elementary is to provide a high
-
quality, standards
-
based education and to support the socia
l
-
emotional 
development of all students. Natoma Station is committed to inspiring students to achieve the highest standards of 
intellectual and personal development through an engaging and comprehensive program. Within a caring, respectful, and 
culturally 
responsive environment, the school is committed to instilling in each student a desire to learn, to take 
appropriate risks, and to accept challenges. The school community is committed to developing students who are resilient 
and adaptable, equipped with th
e knowledge, skills, and disposition to continue their education and become responsible, 
successful adults. The staff at Natoma Station successfully provide a caring atmosphere where students can learn from 
outstanding professionals who are well
-
trained an
d highly
-
qualified educators. We use a Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC) model to continually build teacher efficacy and improve learner outcomes. We are continually building 
teacher leadership and capacity by creating teacher
-
led guiding coalitions 
that support our efforts to reflect upon and 
improve our practice.
 
 
Natoma Station boasts a robust Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) system including several programs 
that contribute to our positive school culture and climate. We teach t
he Second Step curriculum to all students in grades 
K
-
5 to develop their social
-
emotional skills and our teachers and staff use mindfulness activities to support students with 
self
-
regulation. We focus on three school
-
wide behavior standards (Solve Problem
s, Make Good Decisions, and Show 
Respect) to explicitly support positive behavior choices.  Our Cheetah Champ incentive program and our Character Counts 
Upstander Awards Assemblies at the end of each trimester consistently recognize students who make posit
ive choices. 
We develop and support student leadership through our Student Council and include their voice and input as stakeholders 
in decisions affecting our school community. We have developed a new peer mentorship program and this year we will 
offer an
 
alternative recess option for students. We take a progressive approach to discipline and include restorative 
practices such as counseling and reflections, while providing additional supports and interventions, such as participation 
in our Special Friends 
program, to students who are in need of them.
 
 
Natoma Station Elementary families consistently and repeatedly express the desire to be partners in their children's 
education. Natoma Station encourages a productive and responsive partnership between home an
d school. Our 
community partnerships encompass connections with local businesses, city government, and law enforcement agencies 
that add dimension, mentorship, and direction to our school. Our PTO is extremely active, providing many activities and 
events f
or the students and families of Natoma Station. The school expends considerable time and resources establishing 
strong connections to our families and community through School Site Council, (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee 
(ELAC), parent engagemen
t activities,Coffee and Conversation with the Principal, as well as multiple volunteer 
opportunities. Our Blackboard Connect messages (voice, email, and text), school marquee, informational flyers, and 
Schoolwires webpage keep families informed about sched
ules, events and activities happening at school. Teachers 
maintain their own webpages on our website which also allows for two
-
way communication between teachers and 
families and includes the ability for families to check grades. Frequent communication, re
gular conferences, and parent 
involvement in the classroom all help to build a positive learning environment.  We value and intentionally access the 
technology capital in our community. Intel helps to enhance our collective vision through volunteer incenti
ves and 

business community.

supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available
. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the 
district office prior to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Natoma Station Elementary was originally constructed in 1995 and is comprised of 27 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, library,  staff lounge, computer l
ab, and three playgrounds.  Playgrounds contain multiple play areas that 
are located inside a secure, fenced location. Classrooms, work areas, and play areas provide adequate space for teaching 
and learning.  Natoma Station was repainted in 2009. All facil
ity areas are in excellent operating condition, and yards and 
playgrounds are well maintained. The facility provides appropriate classroom space for our students in well
-
heated and 
air
-
conditioned environments. Natoma Station has wireless connectivity thro
ughout the campus.  Natoma Station is a 
safe, well
-
managed site with few safety or facility malfunction reports. Our head custodian performs a daily walk
-
through 
of the school campus to ensure the school is free from litter, graffiti and safety hazards. Ou
r campus is easily accessible 
by students with wheelchairs, crutches, or any other physical challenge. A communication log for facility concerns is 
provided for staff input and addresses areas of safety, supplies, and maintenance issues. This log is checke
d daily by both 
morning and evening custodians. Custodial staff provides consistent efforts to ensure a clean and productive learning 
environment. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to
 
provide for a clean and safe school.

Daily cleaning schedules and routine checks on all facility equipment are performed. As a result of preventative 
maintenance, reports of incidents related to safety, malfunctions, or facility concerns are very few.  D
istrict maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely 
manner. The online work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority are given to emergency 
r
epairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. 
The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation. The district participates in the State
 
School Defe
rred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, e
lectrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Natoma Station 
Elementary parents are valued as partners in their child's education. There are many opportunities 
where parents partner with staff to create a more enriching learning environment for students both inside the classroom 
and on campus. Parents are invited to
 
run for positions on School Site Council (SSC), where they share their ideas and 
work with staff to set policy and appropriate categorical funds. Parents and community members are involved in decision
-
making and are key to the success of our students. At 
Natoma Station, we emphasize the old adage, "It takes a whole 
village to raise a child."
 
 
Teachers and students welcome parental help. All parents are encouraged to attend field trips whenever possible and to 
participate in classroom activities. Parents ca
n work one
-
on
-
one or in small groups with students who may need help in a 
particular subject. This participation is extremely helpful when it comes to students who need additional support from a 
caring adult. Parents are a wonderful source of ideas and cre
ativity. They are encouraged to share special interests with 
students both in the classroom and through after
-
school Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) clubs. By maintaining an 
active role at school, parents reinforce for their students the importance of ed
ucation.
 
 
We consider parents valuable assets to our campus and we are proud to have so many of them working with us to make 
Natoma Station Elementary a place where students learn and grow. Our PTO is very active and provides numerous benefits 
to our schoo
l, including community building events such as our Pancake Breakfast, Trunk or Treat, and Coffee with the 
Principal. Our PTO also helps raise funds so that we can bring science and author assemblies to our students. This year, 
we will continue to provide t
raining to parents and equip them with tools to support their children's learning at home. 
Our PBIS Guiding Coalition will facilitate a parent engagement workshop to support parent understanding of our 
approaches to PBIS, social
-
emotional learning and scho
ol discipline. We will continue to offer a Family Math Night where 
teachers will demonstrate how they use games and manipulatives in their math program to help students gain a deeper 
understanding of math concepts. Both parents and students will be guided 
through the highly engaging math games and 
activities with the support of classroom teachers. This year, we have also planned a family Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) event. Our teachers will provide a variety of engaging STEAM acti
vities for parents 
and students to work on together. Parents are encouraged to attend Back to School Night to understand the curricular 
and behavioral expectations for the year. Open House allows us to showcase student work for parents and our Veterans 
Day
 
Assembly brings our larger community together and allows our students to honor our veterans by presenting an 
engaging program highlighting our gratitude for their service.
 
 
Our school website is updated regularly and our home
-
school communication system (
Blackboard Connect) keeps parents 
informed about important information and upcoming events. All Natoma Station families are encouraged to participate 
in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the  
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) plan. W
e provide 
online access codes to families for our curriculum such as Envision (Math) and Benchmark Advance English Learner 
Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) in addition to supplemental programs such as i
-
Ready. Teachers and the 
Principal provide 
ongoing communication with parents through monthly newsletters, direct contact, and parent
-
teacher 
conferences. Our parent coordinator works closely with our PTO leadership to provide many opportunities for our parent 
community to strengthen partnerships w
ith our school.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school is safe and clean. There were seventeen (17) student accidents reported at our school in the 2018
-
19 school 
year. Restrooms and eating facilities are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned every third day. Any safety hazard that is 
reported is re
viewed immediately and resolved. Safety plans are reviewed each fall and spring. Emergency plans have 
been developed in case a threatening situation should arise.
 
 
Natoma Station Elementary School's approach to maintaining a safe, well ordered, drug free s
chool is to be proactive. A 
partnership between teachers, the school district, parents, and the community supports this approach. The school rules 
are published in the School Handbook and sent home every year in the fall. Our physical education teacher pre
sents 
guidelines for safely using playground equipment and rules for games. Natoma Station has implemented a comprehensive 
Crisis and Safety Plan. Each classroom has a crisis folder with evacuation procedures, evacuation maps, and crisis protocol. 
Teachers
 
and students review crisis protocol and have scheduled crisis drills throughout the year. Safety accommodations 
for physically challenged students are implemented. Campus supervisors are provided with a manual containing 
information on campus rules and st
udents receive grade level instruction on drug and alcohol awareness. Additionally, 
Natoma Station is a "Bully Free Zone." Natoma Station Elementary is implementing the Second Step curriculum for all 
students to promote social/emotional health.  We continu
ally promote a positive and inclusive school culture through a 
comprehensive implementation of PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Program). Our PBIS committee, which is comprised 
of a variety of stakeholders including teachers, the principal, instruction
al assistants, and parents continually works on 
building a positive school culture and examining our data to respond to student needs. In addition, this year our site is 
funding the PIP program (Primary Intervention Program) which allows us to provide addi
tional support to our at
-
risk 
students.
