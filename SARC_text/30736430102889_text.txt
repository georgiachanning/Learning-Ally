By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students and student subgroups in academic achievement.  The Tustin Public Schools 
Foundation and site PTO/PTA also 
supports the school with donations and financial support throughout the year to support school

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) identifies student needs and add

specifically how these categorical funds will support student learning and achievement through a Multi

Tiered System of 
Supports.  The base and supplemental funds are used to provide tiered and targeted supports or interventions for at

risk 
students
 
in the areas of academics, behavior and social

emotional learning, and absenteeism, professional development, 
instructional materials, additional personnel to support all students in accessing academic standards, and technology

Much of the 201

-
19 fiscal funding was used for 21st century teaching and learning by having every grade level become a 
1:1 iPad school. In addition to the 21st century focus, HCE top priority was to ensure learning for ALL students.  Funding 
was also used to hire extra 
support staff to oversee our intervention program for identified At
-
Risk and EL students.  With 
21st century teaching and learning at the forefront and intense interventions as the school's priorities, that is why HCE is 
recognized as a high academic achie
ving school.

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides inte
nsive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year. 
 
Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effect
ive instruction.For the 2017

dedicated teachers engage in collaborative planning two Wednesdays each month. The principal provides staff 
professional development meetings that focus on the processes of Balanced Lit
eracy, English Language Development, 
Cognitively Guided Instruction in Math (CGI), differentiating instruction, data interpretation and analysis and best first 
21st century instruction. We continue to meet in weekly Professional Learning Communities (PLC) 
to plan and target 
instructional practices. The school leadership team meets to discuss school
-
wide timelines, data, and systems to support 
student learning.  Teachers are also supported by district provided instructional coaches.  The coach plans and work
s with 
teachers to improve instruction in Writing Workshop and English Language Development integrated with technology 
practices to ensure success for all students.  We look forward to refining our literacy instruction with our high quality 
professional de

In 2017

-
19 school year our site chose to focus on Balanced Literacy, specifically Writing Workshop.  We 
contracted with Momentum consultants to provide professional development in the area of Writer's Workshop. Due to 
the excess cost of consultant fees, we have relied on our district coaches to continue with instructional support for the 
2019
-
2020 school year.
