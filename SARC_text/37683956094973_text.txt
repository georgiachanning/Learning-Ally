By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP
, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princip
al or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pence's enrollment is at student capacity. Security is bolstered by the presence of a security resident who lives on the 
property and inspects the property dur
ing nights and weekends to prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, surveillance 
cameras are located throughout the campus.
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff takes great care in ensuring that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns
 
are 
mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning schedules are developed by the 
Principal and the Facilities Director to guarantee daily cleaning of campus. Restroom facilities are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Cus
todian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs are addressed 
in a timely manner. Copies of inspections are available at the school and facilities offices.
 
 
The Head Custodian also performs a safety inspection on a mon
thly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities 
office. Regular and preventative maintenance is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work order system 
for efficiency and better record keeping.
 
 
As per Education Code, the distri
ct is required to include in this document, a description of any needed maintenance to 
ensure good repair as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is maintained in a
 
manner that assures that it is clean, safe, and functional as determined 
pursuant to a Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the conditions at a 
school site with ratings of "good," "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overa
ll summary of the conditions at each 
school on a scale of "exemplary," "good," "fair," or "poor." The instrument shall not require capital enhancements beyond 
the standards to which the facility was designed and constructed.
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES GOOD REPAIR 
STATUS
 
Pence Elementary was built in 1975. The following table displays the results of the most recently completed school site 
inspection to determine the school facility's good repair status.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
At the t
ime of the above inspection on August 9, 2019, the average ranking for Pence Elementary was 95.93%, giving the 
school a rating of "Good." The rating is determined by the average of the 15 categories addressed above. Below are the 
percentages, descriptions,
 
and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified in the August FIT report have been completed and/or

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (P
riority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate 
Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the U
niversity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
South Bay Union School District has developed a Crisis Response Box for each of its school sites. Each box contains a 
Comprehensive Emergency Procedural Guidelines binder specific to each site. The 
binder includes state required disaster 
procedures such as, but not limited to, bomb threat, earthquake, fire, medical emergency, missing student, and shootings. 
Evacuation maps, evacuation sites, key phone numbers and district/site communication plan, are
 
just a few of the 
elements included within the plan. School staff reviewed plan on July 19, 2019. School sites conduct various types of drills 
on a regular basis throughout the year and record the exercise on the Emergency Drills Record form, which is sub
mitted 
to the district office.

The South Bay Union School District academic calendar includes four full days and 51 
minimum days (early release 
Wednesdays and other calendared dates) dedicated to staff development. Of the four full days at the beginning of the 
year, two of those days are dedicated to Professional Development while the other two are used for Professional
 
Planning 
Time and Professional Learning Communities. Throughout the school year, 51 Minimum Day Wednesdays and other 
calendared dates, are dedicated to specific teacher tasks. The breakdown of the 51 minimum days is as follows: 26 
Professional Learning Co
mmunities (PLC), 11 Staff Meetings for Professional Development, 3 District Professional 
Development Days, 8 Parent/Teacher Conference Days, and 3 Prepping and Planning Times (PPT). This school year is the 
third year of Teachers College Reading and Writing
 
Project (TCRWP) being fully implemented in grades Transitional 
Kindergarten through Sixth Grade. Through the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop, we are continuing our 
goal of creating a community of readers and writers by providing students nu
merous opportunities to extend their 
understanding of challenging text through a variety of strategies and skills. Teachers plan collaboratively by reviewing 
student work and consulting with the Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA). Detailed planning consi
sts of reviewing and 
sharing strategies and details of the TCRWP Units of Study to ensure that the components of a balanced literacy model 
are fully implemented. Included in this plan, students are given ample opportunities to read and write during class t
ime.  
Teachers utilize the product of these reading and writing periods to measure student efficiency and to tailor the instruction
 
based on formal and informal assessments.  The analyzing of student assessments and work is needed for the planning of 
next 
steps of instruction to help supports students in improving their reading and writing levels and working towards 
student efficacy.
