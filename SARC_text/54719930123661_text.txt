Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

additional information regarding maintaining a safe environment and preparing for emergencies. The plan is revised and 
approved by the s

December 2019.

Professional development at Reagan Learning Community is focused on providing learning facilitators, coaches, and 
administrators with the necessary training to ensure quality learning environments, 
curricula, instruction, and assessment 
at all content levels. Specific topics are identified through a review of student academic achievement data, observation 
records, and self
-
identification of needs. Professional development also addresses issues specif
ic to the performance
-
based system (PBS). Professional development opportunities include: district
-
wide in
-
services; site specific in
-
services; 
observations and training by site or district coaches; grade
-
level or department meetings; and more. The Beginni
ng 
Teachers Support and Assessment (BTSA) and Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) programs also provide assistance to 
beginning and veteran teachers, as necessary. In 2016
-
17 and 2017
-

Development meeting
