Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Safety of the students and staff is of utmost concern of the Pomona Unified School District. Our comprehensive school 
safety plan was reviewed and updated by our site safety team on October 10, 2019.  Revisions included updates to policies 
on disaster prep
aredness, Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) components for a safe and orderly school 
environment, student discipline, suspension/expulsion procedures, child abuse reporting protocols, student dress codes, 
student/staff harassment, and evacu
ation map.
 
Washington is a Positive Behavioral Intervention Support (PBIS) school in year four of implementation. Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is an evidence
-
based, data
-
driven framework proven to reduce disciplinary incidents, 
inc

-
tiered 
approach to prevention, using disciplinary data and principles of behavior analysis to develop school
-
wide, targeted and 
individualized intervent
ions and supports to improve school climate for all students.
