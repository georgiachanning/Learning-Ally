School Description
 
Nestled in the foothills of beautiful South San Francisco, 
California, Sunshine Gardens School offers 
an ambitious and rigorous academic program to all students. Students feel respected and 
connected to their teachers and other staff members. Instruction is personalized and small learning 
environments increase stu
dent contact with teachers. There is a sense at Sunshine Gardens that 
we all have a responsibility to educate our students. Families, businesses, social service agencies, 
and local universities all play a vital role in this effort.
 
 
Our academic program ac
knowledges the needs of our English language learners and provides each 
student with the support he or she needs to be successful. The Leveled Literacy Intervention 
Program, Migrant Education, Speech and Language program, Extended Academic Center, Academic
 
Support program, are important parts of the educational program. There is strong teamwork 
among teachers across all grade levels and we have vigorous collaboration across all our school 
groups, such as School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA), Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), and Teacher 
Leadership Team (TLT).  Our curriculum and instruction are all aligned with the California content 
standards. Research
-
based teaching strat
egies and state
-
adopted materials and texts are used. At 
Sunshine Gardens, we understand and appreciate the role that technology can play in supporting 
student achievement. Sunshine Gardens is now integrating the use of  class sets of iPads and HP 
Streams.
 
Every classroom has a large screen TV, document cameras, and Apple TV devices, in 
addition to our Computer Lab. Ongoing student assessments identify students who need additional 
academic support.  Our Student Success Team (SST) meets frequently to discuss
 
ways that we can 
best meet the academic, behavioral, and social/emotional needs of our students here at Sunshine 
Gardens. We have a commitment to ongoing professional development and have prioritized 
trainings in both academic areas as well as in ways tha
t we can promote student engagement and 
positive behaviors. This year, we are very lucky to have the support of two Reading and one English 
Language Development Specialists. With the experience, guidance, and support, we will offer more 
professional growth
 
opportunities to our staff, and more opportunities for small group and 
differentiated instruction.
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT:
 
The mission of Sunshine Gardens is to prepare all students with 21st century skills and the 
foundation to become Global Citizens. The st
aff, families and community work together to create 
a safe and engaging environment for the whole child that ensures student success, builds character, 
and celebrates diversity. We encourage our students to be their best selves, and to reach their 
goals.

About the SAR
C
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Con
trol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to addre
ss 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.
