School Description
 
The mission of Big Lagoon School is to educate, empower, and 
prepare students in an 
environmentally connected and culturally responsive learning community.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Big Lagoon School offers a broad course of study 
in elementary academic areas. In the multi
-

classroom, instruction is targeted for students' individual needs. The school also provides additional 
academic support through the Indian Education consortium. Native language instruction is 
provided  for 
all grade levels. Kindergarten students are afforded the opportunity to remain on 
campus for the full school day through the Kinder Bridge extended day program.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and 
comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic 
system that provides
 
reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are pu
blicly accessible (e.g., 
the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally 
provided on a first
-

operation, the length of time that a
 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types 
of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
