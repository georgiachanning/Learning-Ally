By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were 
collected:
 
12/30/20
 
 
Pacific Union textbooks and instructional materials are aligned to the academic content standards consistent with the 
cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks. Every student, including English learners, has a textbook, instructi
onal 
materials or both to use in class and to take home. Additional classroom instructional materials, supplies and equipment 
support our quality programs. The school board holds a public hearing on approval for state instructional materials every 
Septembe
r. We have an abundance of instructional materials including supplemental resources, English Learner materials, 
leveled readers, math manipulatives, a well stocked library, and technology throughout the district for student use and 
instruction.
 
 
For 2019
-
2
0, we will continue with implementation of math and English language arts/English language development 
curriculum aligned to Common Core State Standards. Representatives from the staff are also reviewing various science 
curricula in preparation for the Nex
t Generation Science Standards textbook adoption.
 
 
In addition to the curriculum areas, Pacific Union School District provides all students the opportunity to participate in 
visual and performing arts activities. These dance, music, drama and visual arts a
ctivities have certificated instructors and 
materials aligned with the content standards. Activities also include partnerships with community visual and performing 
arts groups in conjunction with our classroom teachers. In 2019
-
20, students will participat
e in workshops provided by 
Arcata Playhouse and Humboldt Light Opera KidCo, local groups who place teaching actors and artists in schools.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pacific Union Elementary School provides a safe, clean and well
-
maintained environment for students and staff. We have 
a full
-
time maintenance supervisor, a full
-
time transportation supervisor, a full
-
time maintenance/transportation assistant 
and a school 
janitor to clean our facility daily. We take great pride in keeping our campus clean and safe. Student safety is 
a priority, and that is reflected in the school safety plan. We work with the City of Arcata to develop safe routes to school
 
and participate a
nnually in the Walk to School Day in October. We have crossing guards on campus and at the main 
intersection adjacent to school for student arrivals, all dismissal times and special events. During summer 2018, the school 
installed a security fence in front
 
of the school leaving only one entrance into the school. Our campus is closed during 
school hours with the one clearly marked entrance directing guests to the front office.
 
 
Our school was built in 1958 with a multipurpose room and cafeteria, four 
primary and four intermediate rooms, one 
kindergarten classroom and school office. We have since added additional classrooms in 1989, 1994, 1997, 2003 and 2004. 
We provide excellent facilities for childcare before and after school. During the summer of 201
5, we replaced the carpeting 
in the day
-
care rooms with high
-
quality Nora tile flooring using deferred maintenance funding.
 
 
In 2003
-
04, we built eight new classrooms, a multimedia library, support services offices, a room for small group work, a 
conferenc
e room and a full
-
sized gymnasium

all of which are accessible for persons with disabilities. Internet access is 
available campus
-
wide.
 
 
Our modernization plan updated the wiring for internet access and included Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
complia
nce for all restrooms, ramps and classrooms.  In 2011, we upgraded from a fractional T1 line to a 10
-
megabit fiber
-
optic line connecting us to the Humboldt County Office of Education for nearly 10 times the internet speed on campus. 
We have a refresh plan 
to replace teacher laptops, student computers, Chromebooks and iPads as part of a five
-
year plan 
to improve student access to technology.
 
 
Our maintenance supervisor checks our facility daily, staff reports needed repairs, and our evening school janitor 
co
mmunicates immediately when a repair needs to be made. Our skilled maintenance staff makes repairs promptly. We 
submit quarterly reports for Williams case settlement compliance to the Humboldt County Office of Education.
 
 
We have play apparatuses for both 
the transitional kindergarten/kindergarten and primary
-
intermediate play areas. Our 
separate kindergarten play area helps maintain the safety of our youngest students. We have four outdoor basketball 
courts, two indoor courts, a softball field, and additio
nal play areas.
 
 
During the summer of 2014, the primary swing set was entirely replaced, and the kindergarten swing set received new 
chains and seats. During the summer of 2017, we replaced the two slides. Additionally, PTO volunteers beautified the 
playgr
ound areas, purchased some new equipment, and put in new, engineered wood fiber in all playgrounds. During the 
summer of 2009, we completed our new fenced garden area adjacent to the arboretum, with raised beds and water lines. 
In 2014, a previous Pacific 
Union Elementary School graduate completed an educational area with benches as part of an 
Eagle Scout project. The scouts also added birdhouses and additional planters and beautified the garden and arboretum. 
Parent volunteers added a small greenhouse area
. In 2017, a grant through Grace USA Foundation provided funding to 
create a garden coordinator position and infrastructure improvements.  Students in all grades benefit from the hands
-
on 
experience of planting, tending, and consuming their own fruits and 
vegetables. Also in 2017, the native plant arboretum 
was beautified with paths, a walkover bridge and signage as part of a Girl Scout Gold Award.
 
 
We also completed a kitchen remodel with new flooring, warming trays, new paint and energy
-
efficient fullspec
trum 
lighting. In 2012
-
13, we implemented a point
-
of
-
service system to decrease the amount of time for recordkeeping for the 
kitchen staff. During the 2014
-
15 school year, the steamer/warmer oven and mixer were both replaced with ones that 
have greater cap
acity and are more energy efficient. A National School Lunch Program Equipment Assistance grant funded 
these. In 2017, we replaced the refrigerator with a more energy
-
efficient model using Proposition 39 funding. We also 
installed new tables and benches in
 
the cafeteria, supported by the cafeteria fund. During the 2018 summer, the freezer 
was replaced using Proposition 39 funding and the warming trays were replaced with cafeteria funds.

Pacific Union has a long history of installing and maintaining energy
-
efficient lighting. In 2007
-
08, we upgraded hallway 
lighting for energy
-
efficient full
-
spectrum lighting. These projects were funded through deferred and routine maintenance 
accounts. In 2008
-
09, we continued our energy
-
efficiency full
-
spectrum lighting pl
an. In 2010, we installed motion sensors 
in classrooms and common areas and installed energyefficient lighting fixtures, as well as replacing bulbs with long
-
life 
energy
-
efficient bulbs. In 2017, we replaced all outside and gymnasium lights with energy
-
eff
icient fixtures using 
Proposition 39 funding. The district also used Proposition 39 funds to replace five aging heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning systems.

[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Pacific Union has
 
many opportunities for parent involvement. As a school wide Title I school, we encourage parent 

Organization (PTO), serve on the School Si
te Council (SSC), District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC), and are 
also a valuable resource for school activities. Parents are an integral part of our school family and are encouraged to 
volunteer in the classrooms to help all students, serve a
s a resource to classes, present at assemblies and make 
presentations for classes.
 
 
Pacific Union is fortunate to have partnerships created by our parents with many local businesses and community groups 
to share resources, activities and career opportuniti
es. PTO sponsors weekly banking opportunities for Umpqua Bank 
account holders through the Learn to Earn in
-
school savings program, while A to Z Eye Care provides monthly eyeglass 
maintenance. Pacific Union Elementary School was one of the first schools to 
implement these unique programs.
 
 
Other volunteer opportunities include the garden, arboretum, classrooms, the library, special programs, field trips, school 
events, athletic events, fundraisers, Artist
-
in
-
Residence, Arts Committee, Arts Month and special 
projects. Parents raise 
funds for our garden, technology purchases, the arts and playground equipment. They also organize and run the school 
carnival, support school and community programs, serve on district committees, and hold school board positions.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Procedures for monthly fire, earthquake and lockdown drills are covered at the beginning of each year and periodically 
throughout the school year. Pacific Union works closely with 
Humboldt County Office of Education (HCOE), Arcata police 
and fire departments, neighboring Mad River Community Hospital, and other local agencies for planning and revising 
procedures to maintain a safe environment for our students and to be a community re
source in times of need. We attend 
community and HCOE scheduled meetings for all our safe school and transportation plans. In addition, Pacific Union 
Elementary School participates in the annual Great California ShakeOut and offers information and training
 
for families 
regarding emergency preparedness. In conjunction with nearby Humboldt State University, Pacific Union has hosted 
several Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) trainings, and numerous Pacific Union staff and parents are CERT 
trained.
 
 
Durin
g the 2019
-
20 school year, Pacific Union Elementary School will benefit from the services of a shared school resource 
officer and diversion counselors. These individuals are employed by the Arcata Police Department and funded through a 
Measure Z grant. Mea
sure Z is a half
-
cent tax increase passed in Humboldt County in November 2014 to maintain and 
enhance safety services. They will not only support individual students, but will also visit the school, read to students, an
d 
attend school events to develop pro
active, positive relationships with staff and students.
 
 
Our School Wellness Plan is part of our safety plan and includes PATHS and Second Step for teaching social skills, problem
-
solving strategies and bullying prevention, health, wellness and nutrition e
ducation. In addition, our suspension and 
expulsion policies are frequently reviewed.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in August 2018.  The school safety 
plan will be reviewed and updated annually.

istrict, in conjunction with another local elementary school, received funding through 
the U.S. Department of Education Elementary and Secondary School Counseling grant for three years to provide additional 
counseling and social work services beginning in 
the 2012
-
13 school year. These professionals provide group and individual 
support to students, administer the California Healthy Kids Survey, and implement various social
-
emotional and anti
-
bullying programs. They support students and families in the area 
of attendance and connect them with community 
resources as needed. They maintain and use data on attendance, discipline and school climate to track progress. Staff also 
received training through the grant.
 
 
Along with providing state
-
adopted materials and 
English Learner (EL) appropriate instruction for our English Learners, we 
provide all important school notices in Spanish. Our EL teacher, with other staff members, hosts events, which bring all 
the Spanish

through differentiated instruction, speakers, specialized classes, music and performing arts, and individual GATE 
opportunities within and outside the classroom. These opportunit
ies include activities in student interest areas, advanced 
mathematics, clubs, such as Writers in the Mist, Science and History Days, social
-
skill building, and mentoring and 
leadership opportunities. Students also attend events such as the GATE Academy ho
sted annually at nearby Humboldt 
State University.
 
 
Our Safe and Drug
-
Free School Program has many components, including our Paths program that teaches social 
interaction skills and bullying prevention. As part of our school
-
wide discipline plan and Safe S
chool Plan, we developed 


ior 
expectations at various campus locations, are posted throughout the school and reinforced by all staff. Our school 
counselors support our students, teachers and families. Our counselors or other support staff can make home visits and 
are a link between
 
the school and the community, providing additional support for families in transition.
 
 
Pacific Union Elementary School received a new bus in July 2012 funded by the California Department of Education Small 
School District and County Office of Education R
eplacement, Reconditioning and Fleet Expansion Program. Since that time,
