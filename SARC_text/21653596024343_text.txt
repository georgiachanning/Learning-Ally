By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

which textbooks and instructional materials have been provi
ded to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 
#2020
-
07 which certifies as required by Education Code ยง60119 that (1) textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or 
instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, 2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content st
andards and consistent 
with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks in the following subjects: mathematics, science, history
-
social 
science, English/language arts, including the English language development component of an adopted program.
 
 
In 
addition to the core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instruction material
s 
used for health, foreign language, and visual/performing arts curricula. During the 2019
-
20 school year, health lessons 
were a co
mponent of the current science curriculum, therefore, the provision of additional classroom materials for health 
lessons was not needed. Students participating in visual and performing arts course work have been provided with a 
textbook and supplemental ma

standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities
 
San Geronimo Valley Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities 
maintenance and 
campus supervision.
 
 
Campus Maintenance
 
San Geronimo Valley Elementary School staff is proud of their beautiful campus and is devoted to maintaining high 
standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices.  The Lagunitas Elementary 

custodial staff is qualified and equipped to handle routine cleaning needs, general maintenance, and minor repairs. 
Following a standard cleaning schedule, two full
-
time day custodians and one maintenance worker are responsible for the 
up
keep of both; Lagunitas & San Geronimo Schools.  The maintenance worker is responsible for general grounds keeping 
and minor repairs; larger projects are typically outsourced to third party contractors. One day custodian is responsible for 
daily cleaning o
f the multi
-
purpose room, classrooms, and restrooms. Teachers communicate unscheduled maintenance 
needs and special projects requests to the secretary who prepares a work order and forwards it to the Chief Business 
Official (CBO) for review and approval.  
The CBO assigns the work order to the custodian/maintenance worker or makes 
arrangements for a third party contractor to fulfill the request.  Emergency situations are given high priority and resolved 
immediately by either the custodial staff or maintenanc
e worker.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, maintenance inspects school facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues that 
require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed immediately. 
R
estrooms are checked periodically as a proactive measure in keeping facilities safe, sanitary, and stocked.
 
 
The principal and school staff continually monitor the campus and its surrounding areas as a proactive measure in keeping 
facilities safe and clean
. Schools are required on an annual basis to conduct a formal inspection of designated areas and 

recent inspection took place on Janu
ary 29, 2018; the School Facility Good Repair Status is table illustrated.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Lagunitas School District allocates funding to assist with maintenance repairs or replacement of existing school building 
components.  These components include
 
but are not limited to, roofing, plumbing, electrical systems, playground 
structures, and exterior painting.  The District's Board of Trustees and Administration understand the need to fund the 
District's Deferred Maintenance program; therefore, funds fro
m the general fund are transferred into the Deferred 
Maintenance fund to cover the cost of repairs and other general maintenance.  In fiscal year 2019
-
20, the Deferred 
Maintenance fund budgeted $130,000 and to date has expended $74,443 of these funds for p
ainting, repairs to fencing 
and gates, repairs to HVAC systems, general maintenance, and gymnasium projects, for both schools; Lagunitas & San 
Geronimo.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
