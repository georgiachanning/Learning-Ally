Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent
 
Year)
 
 
Each school has a separate staff room with adult restrooms and kitchenette facilities.  Common areas for students to enjoy 
at break and lunch have been improved.
 
 
Fammatre School is well maintained by a staff of custodians who are assigned to the 
school. They maintain cleanliness 
and support the facility in many ways. They are supplemented by district staff who regularly assist in building maintenance. 
Custodians assure jobs are completed in a timely manner through an automated work order system. L
earning is enhanced 
by improved lighting output at lower consumption rates. Fire alarm systems are regularly maintained at strict state 
standards. Heating and cooling systems are being added or upgraded in the summer of 2003. Fammatre School is well 
mainta
ined by a staff of custodians who are assigned to the school. They provide cleanliness and support of the facility in 
many ways. They are supplemented by district staff who regularly assist in building maintenance. They assure jobs are 
completed in a timel
y manner through an automated work order system.  In 2015, new perimeter fencing was installed.  
Solar arrays were added in 2015 to meet 85% of the schools electrical needs. The primary play ground was upgraded in 
2015 to enhance the play experience.
 
 
Camb
rian is extremely proud of our technology infrastructure. Our present ratio of students to computers is 3:1 IPads in 
TK
-
2 and 2:1 Chromebooks in grades 3
-
5. Students have computers available in their classroom. Computers are networked 
and linked to the int
ernet. We are currently utilizing digital portfolios for all students to share daily work with their families 
as well as archive work throughout the students years at Fammatre. In 2016, all classrooms had flat screen televisions 
installed to replace the fa
iling Smart Boards.  There is a district wide technology specialist available to the schools and 
additional support from teacher representatives at each site who assist fellow teachers with any problems or questions 
that might occur. There is a districtwid
e technology plan to guide decisions.
 
 
Additional work during the summer of 2006 was completed on the infrastructure, including electrical and plumbing.  All 
classrooms were renovated and a new office was completed in January, 2007.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Asse
ssment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] 
and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standar
ds [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University,

Cambrian is a small school district with a long history of creating a safe learning environment. Absenteeism is less than 4% 
a year; suspensions are less than 1% for the school. Students are aware of safety plans should 
emergencies arise and they 
complete practice drills often. Students and staff practice fire drills once a month, an earthquake drill twice a year as wel
l 
as a lockdown drill once a year. Cambrian works with other agencies to provide a safe environment, whi
ch promotes 
learning.  In addition, the school is sensitive and proactive about medically sensitive issues, such as peanut allergies and 
students with diabetes, and trains staff on how to manage such situations.  For more details, please see our

wide staff professional development are reflective of students, staff, school and district's goals and needs. 
Professional learning activities are designed to engage teachers in learning and implementing best practices that benefit 
student learnin
g in alignment with district goals. These opportunities for professional learning include the following:
 

 
Instructional Rounds

Staff development is designed in our primary areas of focus: Common Core shift, English Learner instruction, questioning 
for critical thinking, and mathematical understanding. Using CCSS assessments, professional developme
nt is aligned with 
district, school, and/or individual professional needs to ensure teachers have the adequate background, skills, and 
materials they need to support student learning. When new programs are introduced (e.g. math, science or language arts), 
a specific time is dedicated to staff development to ensure the even and effective implementation of the program.
