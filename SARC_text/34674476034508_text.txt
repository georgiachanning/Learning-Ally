By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

long learner, reaching their highest level of personal achievement through an innovative, rigorous academic 
curriculum that integrates the visual and performing
 
arts.
 
 
School Profile:
 
Mary A. Deterding Elementary is one of 41 elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District. The curriculum 
provided is aligned to the California Content Standards, while transitioning to the Common Core State Standards. 
Co
mprehensive Balance Literacy is a focus throughout all classes, with teachers integrating Interactive Read Alouds, 
Shared Reading, Writer's Workshop, and Critical Literacy. Our 6th grade classes are focused on Disciplinary Literacy. Our 
teachers strive to 
develop students to become independent workers. All kindergarten through 5th grade teachers are 
participating in Critical Literacy Training this year, which will allow teachers to develop their students' critical thinking
 
dispositions. We will also continu
e to focus on Balanced Literacy, with an emphasis on Writer's Workshop, as we prepare 
to be Common Core ready. Math instruction is of high interest to our teachers, with several teachers participating in 
Sacramento State University's Math Project, and shar
ing their knowledge with staff members. Field trips continue to be 
an important part of the school experience with teachers integrating the experience with the curriculum and grade level 
standards. 
 
 
The school supports cultural awareness on a daily basis 
through its diverse literature selections and other school activities, 
such as the International Food Festival. 
 
 
By integrating the visual and performing arts within the curriculum, the Deterding learning community educates students 
to become critical thi
nkers and effective communicators, growing into leaders who approach new situations with 
confidence and compassion. Kindergarten
-
grade 3 students participate in dance each week. Students in grades 1 
-
 
6 
receive music instruction weekly from our full time m
usic specialist. Grades 4 
-
 
6 students have instrumental instruction 
each week which is embedded during the school day. Students in grades 1 
-
 
6 receive art instruction each week with a full 
time art specialist. Students in 3rd through 6th grades have the 
opportunity to participate in choir each week before or 
after school. 
 
 
The staff at Deterding Elementary believes it is their responsibility to nurture the natural curiosities of students through 
arts, humanities, and sciences, inspiring students to 
become compassionate and confident lifelong learners. By integrating 
visual and performing arts with curriculum, the Deterding learning community educates students to become critical 
thinkers and effective communicators, growing into leaders who approach n
ew situations with confidence and 
compassion. We believe that parent involvement is an important part of each student's success.
 
 
We currently have three kindergarten classes, three first grade classes, three second grade classes, three third grade 
classes
, three fourth grade classes, three fifth grade classes, one fifth/sixth combo, and two sixth grade classes. Included 
in these classes is one Rapid Learner class at each grade level from the 2nd through the 6th grades.

Our site f
ocus continues to be centered around improving student data through the use of Professional Learning 
Communities (PLCs). In PLC meetings each week, teachers look at data and how best to support their students in order for 
them to show growth. Our current s
chool focus is on math, but we continue to work on writing through Writer's 
Workshop, developing critical thinking skills through Critical Literacy, and reading through guided reading practices.

Dear Deterding Families,
 
 
I am ecsta

Deterding is one of three schools in San Juan that is privileged to be home to the Rapid Learner program. Though the Rapid 
Learner program, classes are often working at a different pace than the other classes, it is important for every student at 
Deterding
 
to understand that we are all part of the same community while we meet the individual needs of each student 
in the classroom. We have worked hard to create a community where everyone is welcome.
 
 
Our staff is working diligently to continue with the implem
entation of the Common Core State Standards (or CCSS). We 

Literacy Language Arts program. We have the privilege of working with Rick Wes
t, a professor from UC Davis, to constantly 
improve our math instructional practices and engage our students in problem solving. One of the major shifts with 
Common Core is writing across all subject areas and the integration of technology. We are continui
ng our use of a typing 
program to support students as they prepare for CAASPP (California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, 
the standardized Common Core test created by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) and also the use of 
Int
erim Assessments provided by Smarter Balanced. Our fabulous team of teachers is working hard to collaborate and 
ensure that we have a continuum K

are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Deterding Elementary School, constructed in 1953, was modernized during 1997.  Currently, enrollment slightly exceeds 
existing capacity. Site custodial staff clean the buildings, along with district support for major/minor repairs. The distric
t 
pro
vides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills are held, and badges are 
required for all visitors and personnel. Field repair, driveway resurfacing, and insufficient parking for staff and visitors 
continues to b
e a concern. Utilizing Measure J bond funds the site received both hard court and parking lot resurfacing 
and a major landscape and irrigation project was completed in 2008. During the summer of 2011 all student restrooms 
were renovated and updated, with a
n additional girl's bathroom added.  Recently, a portable was added to the campus to 

 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are pr
ovided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
cla
ssrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessa
ry to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. Th
e Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use o
f cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with fundin
g allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $
2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical and custodial staff that inc
ludes both 
operational and instructional topics.
