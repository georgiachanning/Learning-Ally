Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The mission of Marks Staff is to ensure a safe, nurturing, environment in which every 
child will have the opportunity to 
achieve their essential, grade
-

perform to their greatest ability.
 
 
As educators at Marks Elementary, we will pledge to be dedica

student academic improvement by employing professional teaching strategies such as extended guided reading, inquiry

providing intervention and always performing to our greatest ability.
 
 
We will determine students' academic success by using frequent formal and informal assessments, such as benchmark 
assessments, common formative assess
ments, authentic assessments, informal observations, classroom projects, student 
journals, and student confidence. We use the assessment results to guide instruction; thereby creating a cycle of 
continuous improvement.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to

Marks Elementary School 
strives on building a strong relationship with parents by including them in the decision making 
process on a regular basis. The site provides School Site Council and English Advisory Council meetings so that parents 
have the opportunity to learn of the edu
cational program and the funding sources of the site. Parents are active 
participants when making decisions on the expenditures of the categorical monies and of the educational programs at 
Marks Elementary School. The site is also encouraged by the need to
 
provide educational workshops that involve parents 
and their children. Parents are also invited to all school activities such as Back to School Night, Open House, Academic 
Awards, safety programs, Parent
-
Teacher Conferences and all other site activities. 
In the Spring 2019 the district will be 
holding PIQE workshops for parents to participate in.

Marks Elementary has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan that is reviewed and updated annually. The plan is reviewed 
with staff annually at the beginning of each school year. Our Marks Elementary School Site Council (SSC) approves our 
Safe School

emergency. We strive to create and maintain a safe, clean, respectful and orderly school campus that encourages positive 
attitudes in students and sta
ff. Marks Elementary School's comprehensive safety plan was reviewed and updated in August 
of 2019 by the Marks faculty. The plan with any changes is approved by the Dos Palos Oro
-

best trained teachers for our 
students' academic success. We believe it is of great importance that all educators continue 
professional training throughout their careers. Our teachers and administrators participate in ongoing workshops, college 
classes, program training, and on site co
aching. The Dos Palos Oro Loma JUSD has contracted with Merced County Office

will have an opportunity to participate in training breaking
