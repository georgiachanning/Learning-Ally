 School Accountability Report Card
 Reported Using Data from the 2018
-19 School Year
 Published During 2019
-20   By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.  For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.  For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our vision at Independent Charter School is that all students can learn at high levels when instruction meets their needs.
 
 
Independent Charter School teachers, administrators and staff are committed to the continuous impr
ovement of 
classroom instruction, organizational practices and site leadership to improve student learning. We are committed to 
providing students with opportunities to exceed their potential and a learning environment that supports all learners.
 
 
In the s
pring of 2009, a committed group of teachers, parents, staff and community stakeholders met to create a Charter 
school which would offer an independent study, home
-
based learning program to meet the needs of students and families 
learning together.  One im
portant goal was to offer a program where children who may not have been successful in a 
traditional seat
-
based classroom environment could find success in a program tailored for their individual success.  The 
founding group also felt strongly that the pro
gram should prepare students to succeed in the 21st century and a global 
economy.  To achieve this goal three elements are highlighted in the program:  Rigorous academics through blended 
learning, community interaction and involvement, and family involveme
nt and participation in daily learning.
 
 
In the fall of 2014, ICS expanded to include a seat
-
based program beginning with grades K
-
2.  Beginning in the school year 
2016
-
2017 Perkins Elementary School joined Independence Charter. bringing site enrollment to
 
401 students. 
Independence Charter School enrollment total 80 students.  The two schools operate in tandem, sharing facilities, staff, 
and instructional programs. ICS provides a small school atmosphere where families and staff work together to educate 
eac
h child.  Emphasis is placed on preparing students for high school success, leading to college and career readiness.  
Highly qualified teachers teach to the heart and minds of the children and incorporate families in the learning process of 
their children.
 
 
Independence Charter Students participate in hands
-
on learning activities and field trips into the community.  In addition 
to participating in field trips, students also have access to the community through a career fair where community members 
share the
ir knowledge, skills and career opportunities with students in Transitional Kinder to 5th grade through a series 
of presentations.
 
 
Independence Charter School Students participate in full S.T.E.A.M (Science Technology Engineering Arts and 
Mathematics) days at  least one time per month.   Activities may include learning with technology, participating in Social 
Skills Lessons and highly structured physical fitness activities.  All students benefit from regular exposure to a variety of
 
program
s. Children also participate in Harvest of the Month nutrition education activities which emphasize healthy 
lifestyle habits like eating fruits and vegetables every day.  Staff, students and parents work together to select and find 
enrichment opportunities

e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Salida Union School District Safety committee reviews and updates the site Safety Plan.  The key elements of our 
School Safety Plan include:  Preparedness for emergency and natural 
disaster, awareness of the school's physical and 
social environments, and expected characteristics of a safe school and school culture.  These elements are reviewed 
annually in a staff meeting with school personnel.  Parent/Student and Teacher handbooks ar
e prepared and distributed 
to students and staff for their review on the first day of each school year.  The school handbook clearly outlines procedures
 
and academic and behavioral expectations for students and families.  To adequately prepare teachers for
 
emergencies, 
each classroom is equipped with an emergency folder including parent contact information. Teachers have also been 
issued packs containing first aid supplies to wear during yard duty and on school field trips.  Additionally, safety procedur
es 
such as proper yard duty techniques and enforcement of playground safety rules are reviewed during staff meetings 
throughout the school year.  Independence Charter is in the initial phase of developing the Positive Behavior Intervention 
and Support framewo
rk to address the social/emotional needs of students and to develop a community culture built on 

fire drill practice, earthquake prepared
ness drills and lock
-
down procedures. Each classroom is also supplied with a 

lock down on our school campus.  A copy of the Independence Ch
arter School Safety Plan is available at our District Office 
for public review and on the district website at https://www.salida.k12.ca.us/domain/1552.

good citizenship at assemblies and in their classrooms. Visitors to our campus follow specific check
