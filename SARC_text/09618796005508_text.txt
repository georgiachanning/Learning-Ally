By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The mission of Gold Oak Elementary School is to provide academically rigorous curriculum by promoting and challenging 
the intellectual, creative, physical, and social de
velopment of all students in an environment where students are respected 
and feel connected.  At Gold Oak, we foster positive behavior through PBIS, Positive Behavior, Intervention & Support 
model.  We utilize the BEARS acronym to represent our expectation
s: Be respectful, Expect success, Act responsibly, 
Remember safety, Support each other.
 
 
Gold Oak school serves approximately 319 students in Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade.  Gold Oak School  is 
situated in the community of Pleasant Valley i
n the Sierra foothills, ten miles southeast of Placerville.  The early grades are 
designed with a significant emphasis on literacy and math. Our TK/K program is a full day program which provides 
additional academic and social/emotional development time for
 
our youngest students.  Gold Oak Elementary School has 
a staff of dedicated, caring and well
-
trained personnel who provide equal access to the core curriculum in self
-
contained 
classrooms.  We are fortunate to have both a PE Specialist and Music Specialis
t on staff.  They provide our students with 
a standards
-
based PE program as well as music classes in grades TK
-
5th, choir and instrumental opportunities are available 
in the upper grades. The principal and staff have worked together to form a collaborative
 
environment in which 
understanding, listening, and constructive feedback are essential for the success of our students and staff.  Gold Oak 
Elementary has a sense of community with shared responsibility for all involved persons.  All stakeholders and thei
r 
opinions are valued and respected.
 
 
Great emphasis is placed on building a strong academic foundation in all grades for all children. Our philosophy is that all 
students receive a rigorous standards
-
based curriculum using research
-
based instructional pra
ctices.  The curriculum is 
adapted to meet the unique needs of all learners by making modifications in complexity, depth and pacing of lessons.  
Students are placed in appropriate intervention programs based on their specific needs with the expectation tha
t all 
students will achieve grade level standards.  The efforts of Gold Oak professionals are focused on providing the best

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our spacious campus meets the needs of the Gold Oak student b
ody as well as an El Dorado County Office of Education 
class situated on the Gold Oak campus. With the use of Bond monies, we were able to complete Phase 1 of our campus 
remodel in the summer of 2011.  This included the creation of a new, large central par
king area with designated student 
drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas.  Parking had been both a District and community concern for many years.  The new lot has 
alleviated many traffic safety concerns, as well as provided an efficient, monitored, and safe student ac
cess point.    We 
continue to maintain our playground area, the sports blacktop and our fields.  We are aware that these areas and 
equipment are beginning to age and have created a plan to allocate funding for these future investments.   Our school 
garden 
has been enlarged and continues to get upgrades through community donations and active parent involvement.  
Additionally we were able to create a beautiful courtyard for our students through parent and community support.   ADA 
access has been updated and d
esigned to meet current requirements.  The custodial and grounds staff work continually 
to inspect, maintain, and upgrade the facility. Particular attention is paid to those areas used by all the students. 
Bathrooms are clean, and parts are replaced as nee
ded. The plumbing facilities are in good condition as are the floors, 
walls, roof, and electrical system.  In September 2017 we replaced an aged water fountain outside our multi
-
purpose room 
and installed a water fountain with water bottle filling station.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The 
district has developed several policies that assist the staff and students with campus safety, fire drills, earthquake 
preparedness, lockdown drills, and cafeteria and playground supervision.  Our Comprehensive School Safety Plan 
addresses procedures for a
nticipated emergency situations, as well as chain of command and communication plans.  The 
plan is reviewed annually with both site staff, as well as our school site council.  We update classroom emergency supplies 
with help from the community, parents and
 
PTO.
 
 
Yard duty supervisors are employed to promote safety each day in the cafeteria and on the playground during all recesses. 
Fire drills are monitored each month and other disaster drills are conducted throughout the year. We also utilize radios as 
add
itional communication tools during school hours.  Additionally, bus evacuation procedures and safety drills are carried 
out each year. We have a RN twice a month assisting office personnel, staff, students, and parents with health concerns. 
We also have a 
LVN for 4 hours a day meeting individual needs of students in the district.  All efforts to ensure building 
safety, cleanliness, and adequacy have been successful in maintaining our school facilities.  Staff members are trained 
annually in Mandated Reporti
ng requirements and other health and safety issues. Multiple staff members are trained in 
how to shut off the various utilities in the event of an emergency. Administration works collaboratively with the County 
Office and local law enforcement on school sa
fety measures.
 
 
Each year, School Site Council reviews and provides input regarding the school safety plan. The plan is evaluated and 
updated based on the input from the council as well as other stakeholders.

In GOUSD, there is one full day dedicated to staff development before the school year begins. Gold Oak also has 
approximately eight minimum days per year where the afternoons are dedicated to staff 
development. Finally, staff 
development occurs at our monthly staff meetings as well as our grade level meetings.  Staff development is selected 
based on the needs determined through our state dashboard data and surveys of staff needs.  Staff development o
ccurs 
though in class peer coaching, professional workshops, conference attendance and mini staff led workshops during our 
early release collaboration time.  Lead teachers have been trained in UDL (Universal Design for Learning) to support all 
curricular a
reas and additional teachers will be trained this year. In addition to curricular areas, staff development will 
focus on ongoing culture and climate work including inservice on PBIS (Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports) and 
Love and Logic. The st
aff will also take part in training in MTSS
--
Multi
-
tiered System of Support which will focus on quality 
first instruction and levels of academic, behavioral and social
-
emotional support.  At grade level meetings we specifically 
focus on RTI and meeting stu
dent needs based on individual student data.  Staff is also encouraged to attend professional 
development hosted by the El Dorado County Office of Education that are aligned to our LCAP and SPSA goals as well as 
through other learning opportunities over th
e summer and during the school year.
