literate in both English 
and Spanish. Students in the program are provided with a high quality standards based curriculum 
that fosters 
a deeper understanding of concepts based on students mastering concepts/skills in 
two languages. In addition, students are equipped with the 21st century skills (Critical Thinking, 
Creativity, Collaboration, Communication) needed to be college and career r
eady. Finally, we 
understand that having a Growth Mindset allows our abilities to be developed and enhanced 
through effort, perseverance, and a diligent work

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district 
makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs in Porterville Unified Schoo
l District. The mission is to empower families 
with the knowledge and skills to partner with schools and communities to ensure their children achieve their full potential. 
Parents can participate and 
be elected to be on the School Site Council Committee (S
SC). The SSC plays an important role with the responsibilities of reviewing and analyzing student 
achievement data, gathering community input, helping develop the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, developing the school budget, and monitoring 
the impleme

visory Committee 
(ELAC). The role of ELAC is to advise the Principal and School Site Council on programs and services for English L
earners. Santa Fe Elementary also provides 
quarterly parent meetings to update parents on current events and initiatives taking place throughout the school year. Finall
y, Parent Institute for Quality 
Education (PIQE) classes for parents are also offered as
 
well as English Second Language (ESL) classes for parents to build their English language.
 
 
Santa Fe has an array of rich traditions for parents to be involved in. Some of the events include Día de Los Muertos celebra
tion, Christmas Program, 
Multicultural
 
Fair, Donuts with Dads, Muffins with Moms, Father
-
Daughter/Mother
-
Son dance, and an end of the year Parent BBQ. Santa Fe takes pride 
in students efforts, diligent work, and accomplishments resulting in consistent recognition throughout the year with award
 
assemblies, Patriot of the 
Month luncheons, and reading and math incentives throughout the year in where parents are invited to attend. Finally, parents
 
are encouraged to 
chaperone field trips and volunteer in the classroom throughout the year.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Santa Fe Elementary School. Students are supervised on campus before
 
and after school, and 
during all break times. Furthermore, there are
 
designated areas for student drop
-
off and pick
-
up. All visitors must sign in at the office and display their 
visitor badge at all times. Additionally for the safety of our students, all volunteers are fingerprinted and cleared through
 
the Department of Ju
stice. All 
fingerprinting appointments must be made through our school site secretary. Safety drills (fire, earthquake, lockout/lockdown
) are practiced 
monthly/quarterly. Finally, School Safety plans are reviewed annually. The School Site Safety Plan was m
ost recently reviewed in Fall 2019.
