School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent and Learning Coach involvemen
t is a vital part of Insight @ San Diego.  Parents are an extremely important part of 

 
 
Parents are involved from the start of the school year by researching our progra
m and choosing to enroll in our program. 
Parents who attend an orientation session agree to the enrollment requirements.  These show they are committed to 
being an active member of the education team for their student in our program. Parents during this ti
me are also trained 
on how the online instructional system works, attendance, and how to support their students. Parents also receive a 
survey after the orientation to ensure all of their needs or concerns are addressed.
 
 
Throughout the school year, parent
s are invited to participate in Learning Coach University.  Learning Coach University is 
a monthly opportunity for parents and Learning Coaches to learn skills to help support their student in being academically 
successful here at Insight @ San Diego.  Top
ics such as motivating students, where to start, OLS basics, and much more 
are covered during these sessions.  Parents also have the opportunity to attend monthly outings with their students. Each 
month, Insight @ San Diego offers students an opportunity t
o explore careers through tours of businesses or colleges. 
Insight also offers quarterly outings for students and parents to ensure the connection to the school is strong.
 
 
Parents also participate in our Family Academic Support Program. The Family Academi
c Support Team (FAST) provides 
academic assistance, encouragement, and support to students and Learning Coaches when such support/assistance is 
requested or deemed necessary to achieve academic success in the virtual school environment.  During this time p
arents 
work with the FAST team on a Back on Track plan. The mission is to help the student get on track to pass their courses.
 
 
Parents are actively encouraged to participate in Insight @ San Diego planning, organizational, Board of Directors, and 
other me
etings. They are also encouraged to offer ideas and planning assistance with field trips, social events, and other 
outings.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Insight @ San Diego takes staff and student health and safety very seriously. Due to the nature of the virtual environment, 
there will be no need for a school building where classes are held on a daily basis. The administrative office curre
ntly 
complies with all ADA, OSHA, and local health and safety requirements. The school has obtained all necessary permits for 
these offices including a building and fire marshal inspection and/or a certificate of occupancy.
 
 
Immunization forms and other pe
rtinent medical records will be kept (confidentially) on file by the school administration. 
Parents are expected to ensure that their children obtain proper immunizations prior to matriculating pursuant to Chapter 
1 (commencing with §120325) of Part 2 of D
ivision 105 of the Health and Safety Code. The school may exempt students 
from enrolling who are not properly immunized pursuant to §48216 (a
-
c) of the Education Code. Those parents who are 
having difficulty obtaining immunizations for their children will 
be provided information on where to get immunized in 
their community.
 
 
All pertinent and required health and safety documentation is collected at time of hire or enrollment as appropriate. 

ds held in security at the Simi Valley, CA office. Copies 
of employee records and student records can be made available at the request of the School District.
 
 
The school has drafted health and safety procedures that the school will follow to ensure the he
alth and safety of pupils 
which include compliance with the criminal background check requirements described in Sections 44237 and 45125.1 of 
the Education Code.
