By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 24, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, and determined that each 
school within the district had sufficient and g
ood quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their
 
own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instruction
al materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most 
current available. Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the school Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent ex
amination at the district 
office prior to adoption.
 
The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

Maintenance & Repair
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program, including regular facilities inspections, to ensure that all 
classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and 
in good repair. When necessary, the district takes appropriate actions 
to ensure campus facilities are in good working order and provide a clean and safe environment for all members of the 
school community. A work order process is used to ensure efficient 
service and highest priority to emergency repairs. At 
the time of publication, 100% of restrooms on campus were in good working order.  Safety walks by school
-
site personnel 
are conducted on a monthly basis to address safety
-
related concerns, again through
 
the work order process.
 
 
Cleaning Process & Schedule
 
A team of four full
-
time custodians as well as crew of gardeners ensure classrooms, restrooms, and
 
campus grounds are kept clean and safe everyday.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Myron D.Witter Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school complies 
with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Many people visit 
the campus to vo
lunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Volunteers must apply for and receive 
fingerprint and background clearance through our District Office. Volunteers and visitors are welcome, however the school 
is a closed campus and all volunteers
 
and visitors must check in at the front office and receive a visitor's sticker or volunteer 
badge.  Volunteers/Visitors are required to return to the school office upon departure..
 
 
To ensure a safe and orderly campus environment, school grounds are monit
ored before, during, and after school by 
assigned staff including administration, teachers,classified staff, duty supervisors and two part time security guards. 
Brawley Elementary School District has established a detailed disaster plan for each of its sch
ools in the event of a disaster. 
The plan clearly explains specific duties and responsibilities for all levels of staff and site personnel, including certific
ated, 
classified, and support staff.  The plan is designed to ensure student and staff safety duri
ng a disaster. The Comprehensive 
Safety Plan was developed by the district in consultation with local law enforcement and fire officials and is in compliance 
with Senate Bill 187 of 1997.
 
 
The Safety Plan was designed to assist in preparing for emergencies
, managing emergency response efforts, and 
maintaining a safe school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and 
intervention techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and
 
students. The plan provides 
students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive Safety 
Plan include current status of school crime, child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dange
rous pupil 
procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, the sexual harassment 
policy, the dress code, and procedures related to the compliance of existing laws as they affect school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are 
conducted monthly throughout the school year. Earthquake, intruder, bomb
-
threat, and disaster drills are 
conducted throughout the year. Safety procedures, including elements of the Comprehensive Safety Plan, are reviewed 
with school and District staff in t
he Fall, and approved by School Site Council by February each school year. An updated 
copy of the plan is available to the public at the District office. The plan was last updated, reviewed with staff and parent
s, 
and approved by the Governing Board on Feb
ruary 26, 2019.

During the 17
-
18 school year, the BESD plan for action was titled "Championing Student Learning".  This plan included 
intensive work with WestEd to provide English Learners with language instruction coupled with CCSS.  In addition, we have 
partnered with C
OEs to provide ELA Unit Development planning for our grade levels, as well as providing math support 
for the BESD Math Committee.  We will continue to provide time for collaboration to support our endeavor to become a 
professional learning community.  Our 
PD Plan for 18
-
19 included a strand for new teachers, as well as ongoing 
professional development in supporting our RtI supplemental programs. We had a large group of educators participate in 
a BeGLAD Pilot in 18
-
19; educators received 6 intensive days of 
professional development.  In addition, we are now in our 
third year of PBIS training, with the goal of supporting students not only academically, but also behaviorally.    Our focus 
for 19
-
20 is to create a sustainable model that includes ongoing training
 
in the following areas:  BeGLAD certification, PBIS, 
grade level math collaboration focused on content and mathematical practices, and new teacher instructional support.  
This year, we have also begun our journey with Professional Learning Communities.  F
inally, this is our first year to 
introduce Co
-
Teaching in two of our schools, with a goal of including all schools in the future. We continue to utilize the 
expertise of our Academic Coaches to provide differentiated teacher support at the site level.  Wh
ile our goal is to keep 
teachers in the classroom, we offer training scheduled during the school day, as well as after school.  Our site Educational 
Technology Mentors continue to offer hands
-
on support to their site teachers, including  training opportuni
ties scheduled 
at the end of the school day.
