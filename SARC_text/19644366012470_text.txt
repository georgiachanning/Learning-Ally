By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cypress Elementary School is located twenty
-
five miles east of 
Los Angeles in the East San Gabriel Valley and has an 
enrollment of 700 students in grades Transitional Kindergarten through fifth. The school is part of the Covina
-
Valley 
Unified School District which is composed of nine elementary schools serving K
-
5, th
ree middle schools serving grades 6
-
8, three comprehensive high schools, and one alternative high school. The campus hosts a Kids Korner Daycare.
 
 
On the 2017
-
2018 CAASPP, 56% of students at Cypress met or exceeded the standard in English Language Arts.  I
n 
Mathematics, 39% of students met or exceeded the standard. We continue to focus on our ELL population and our SED 
populations along with significant targeted interventions for all of our Kindergarten through fifth grade students who do 
not meet the stand
ard.
 
 
Cypress School is one of nine computer science magnet schools in the Covina
-
Valley Unified School District. Cypress is a 
one
-
to
-
one school where all students have their own Chromebook or Lenovo and are learning CODE as their second 
language.  This ye
ar Cypress is again partnering with Code to the Future. Students grades TK
-
5th use their 21st Century 
skills of collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and communication in an environment where computer science is taught 
as a normal discipline in the
 
classroom.
 
 
As part of our ongoing plan to sustain growth, our leadership team conducts a yearly needs assessment and evaluates our 
systematic intervention program to ensure that it continues to meet our students' needs.  We continue to offer an 
intervent
ion/extension rotation designed to provide dedicated leveled instruction for 45 minutes daily.  Students are 
tested to determine which intervention they will receive and are retested at each trimester using standards
-
based STAR 
and i
-
Ready reading and math
 
assessments to determine response to intervention. These findings are discussed within 
the grade level PLC meetings to make adjustments to the students' schedules and are documented in the yearly planning 
meetings with the principal.
 
 
Daily leveled ELD is
 
integrated into daily intervention for Kindergarten through 5th grade students.  Cypress teachers are 
trained in GLAD strategies to help students develop rich vocabulary and concept knowledge.
 
 
Currently, 15% of the students are categorized as English Lan
guage Learners (ELL) with the majority speaking Spanish.  
Cypress is a Schoolwide Title I school with 79% of the students on Free or Reduced lunch.   Other demographics include: 
3% African
-
American, 3% Asian, 3% Filipino, 83% Hispanic/Latino, 7% White, 3% 
African American, and 1% two or more 
races.
 
 
All of the 34 teachers are fully credentialed, meet the ESSA State Standards for highly qualified, and are CLAD certified.  
Our staff includes four Special Education teachers in our Specialized Academic Instruct
ion Program. In addition, we have 
2 Speech and Language Pathologists and a part time Adaptive PE teacher. Cypress also has a Title 1 Intervention Specialist 
who works with our socioeconomically disadvantaged population, coordinates, and teaches our interve
ntion program.
 
 
Cypress Elementary School was constructed in 1956 and had some upgrades in 1994 through a modernization process.

Cypress is proud to be a Gold Ribbon School and a Title I High Achieving School.  The cultures of Cypress students are 
celebrated and respected through a variety of events throughout the school year including our Read on the Green 
c
elebration in March.  Cypress has a very active PTA that works in conjunction with the staff to enhance learning 
opportunities for students through field trips and assemblies. Our Parent University has an active population that helps 
educate and link paren
ts to school activities and volunteer opportunities.  Through PTA, Cypress has developed many 
community partners that offer services to the Cypress School family.
 
 
CYPRESS VISION AND MISSION STATEMENT
 
At Cypress, we believe that our students will one day c
hange the world.  Cypress Elementary School is a caring and 
collaborative community where students are empowered to own their educational experience.  We are committed to 
providing a safe and nurturing environment and developing self
-
motivated thinkers who
 
are able to succeed in an ever
-
changing world. We aim to see learning through the eyes of our students and want students to actively be their own 
teachers. We want students to be visible learners.  To do so, they must continually ask themselves: "Where am
 
I going?", 
"How am I doing?", and "Where do I go next?".  We are committed to a growth mindset and the belief that everyone can 
get a little bit better every day.

Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at every school throughout the District. Each school complies with laws, 
rules, and 

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted regularly throughout the sc


West Covina and Covina Police Departments). The do

updates are completed if a school discipline policy is added or modified, changes are made to the campus map, additions 
and/or modifications are made to the telephone trees, etc. All visit
ors must check in at the school office and wear a visitor 
badge while on school grounds. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, staff members supervise students 
and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and
 
orderly environment. The 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by administrators, other school staff members, and Los Angeles County 
Office of Education staff members. It is reviewed, approved, and evaluated by the School Site Council in cooperat
ion with 
local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the 
following: child 
abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response 
procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policy, and suspension and expulsion 
policies. The plan is reviewed annually
 
with school staff. An updated copy is available to the public at the school and 
District Office.
