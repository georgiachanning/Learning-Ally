By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

Each year the school safety plan is reviewed and brought up to date by the staff, school site council 
committee, and the 
school board.  A weekly walk 
-
 
about of the school and its playground assures that items needing attention are repaired 
and/or replaced.  Monthly fire drills are held so that children and staff are aware of and understand emergency 
proce
dures.  Earthquake drills are practiced each semester.  Lock down and evacuation drills are practiced each year as 
well.  We have a safety committee that will be reviewing our plan with a Safety Coordinator from Modoc County Office of 
Education.

Tulelake Basin Elementary School provides 3 full days at the beginning of each school year dedicated to professional 
development and preparation fro the upcoming year. During the 
2015
-
2016 school year, the school calendar was changed 
from late start Mondays to early release on Wednesdays to provide additional time with other schools in the county as 
well as four instructional coaches.  We have dedicated much of the time to English 
Language Development, SDAIE and 
engagement strategies.  We also encourage all staff to attend content
-
based workshops throughout the year.  The school 
has dedicated professional development money to training teachers in the area of character development.

Tulelake Basin Joint Unified School District utilizes a "Trainer
-
of
-
Trainers" model for professional development.  Due to 
our rural location, much of our training is held in Shasta or Tehama Counties.  The teachers that go out of district are 
required to c
ome back and share what they have learned.
 
 
Additionally, TBJUSD utilizes the Professional Learning Team provided by Modoc County Office of Education.  These 
instructional coaches provide "in classroom" support through teacher request or administrative req
uest.
