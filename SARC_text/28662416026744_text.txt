About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

English Language Arts and Mathematics adoptions are from the most recent adoption cycle. Teachers reviewed the SBE list of ma
terials and worked in 
committee to determine the best fit for Calis
toga Elementary School. In the case of the mathematics materials, several publishers were field tested prior 
to the ultimate selection of My Math. Both ELA and math materials were adopted in the spring of 2016. Because a science adopt
ion has not occurred 
s
ince 2008, Discovery Science Tech Book is being implemented as a supplemental curriculum to address Next Generation Science S
tandards.
 
 
There are no issues with insufficiency of textbooks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Calistoga Elementary School was built in 1956. In addition to 28 regular classrooms, there is a band room, a science/art room
, a cafeteria/multipurpose 
room, a media room, and a dedicated technology classroom. Two conference rooms are available for parent 
and staff meetings.
 
 
Calistoga JUSD completed a modernization project resulting in beautiful state
-
of
-
the
-
art classrooms equipped with technology, new furniture, and 
photovoltaic lighting. The library was also modernized, which includes natural lighting co
nveying a bright and cheerful atmosphere. The library is 
aesthetically pleasing with a modern appeal; a calm and open space conducive to reading, studying, and small group lessons. W
ith the modernization, a 
Wet Lab was created for science and art lessons, 
and a self
-
contained media center was added to the library, allowing for classes to work with a mobile 
technology lab and to host guest presentations. A brand new fire alarm system was also installed during the summer of 2015.
 
 
The school facilities are ke
pt in excellent condition. A custodial staff member, two groundskeepers and maintenance personnel assure a clean and safe 
school grounds with facilities in top physical repair.

for parent involvement. This 
year, we are changing from a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to a distr
ict
-
based Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). In addition to our parent 
organization, we have a District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC). Meetings focus on programs and services for Engl
ish Learners (ELs). All 
members of the public are invited an
d parents of English Learners comprise the leadership. We have continued with our Parent Engagement opportunities 
on the third Friday of the month. At these meetings, parents meet to review a specific topic (e.g. Supporting Your Child With
 
Homework, Digita
l 
Citizenship, Attendance, Volunteering at Your Child's School). Topics are highlighted in the school newsletter. Our School Si
te Council (SSC) meets nine 
times per year.
 
 
Community organizations also support Calistoga Elementary School. Reading Aloud Prog
ram, a reading program for Calistoga Elementary School 
classrooms, incorporating volunteer readers from the Calistoga community, is coordinated through the Soroptimist Club of Cali
stoga. The program is 
offered to grades K
-
6. The Calistoga Education Foundat
ion (CEF) provides classrooms with financial support allowing students to benefit educationally 
from special programs, field trips, and guest presenters. Parents and community members assist with homework help and after

school tutorial time as 
well.

Two professional development days are provided to teachers prior to the start of school in August, followed by an additional 
three embedded professional 
development days scheduled during the school year. In addition, a modified day each week allows collabo
ration and planning time for instructional 
teams. Instructional minutes on the four unmodified days are extended to ensure students are provided full instructional time
 
each week. Teachers also 
attend conferences, workshops, training and present best pract
ices to one another at staff meetings and during collaboration time to support effective 
Common Core implementation.
 
 
For the most recent three
-
year period, we had 5 days each year dedicated to staff and professional development.
 
 
In 2016
-
2017, Professiona
l Development focused on the new English Language Arts adoption. Staff received support on using the new materials.
 
 
In 2017
-
2018, Professional Development focused on implementing Illuminate, the student data management system. Teachers also refined 
report
 
cards 
to reflect current adopted programs. A team attended Illuminate training off site as well.
 
 
In 2018
-
2019, Professional Development focused on Restorative Practices (to determine alternatives to student suspension) and teacher
s also were 
surveyed abo
ut topics of interest (technology, supporting students with autism, mathematics).
 
 
In 2019
-
2020 Professional Development focused on Response to Intervention, Professional Learning Communities, and Culturally Responsi
ve Teaching.
 
 
Implementation is supporte
d through staff meetings, mentoring, and follow up professional development.
