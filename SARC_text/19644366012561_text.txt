By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mesa Elementary School currently serves 750 Transitional Kindergar
ten through fifth grade students with a strong 
emphasis on academic excellence and outstanding student achievement. Many families have had several generations of 
students attend Mesa Elementary School due to the quality education the school provides. A hig
h level of community 
involvement and strong educational partnerships enrich Mesa's learning environment. Hundreds of volunteers are 
dedicated to the ongoing support of the school's vision as they donate thousands of hours each year.
 
 
Mesa's commitment to p
roviding outstanding educational opportunities is reflected in the dedication of its teachers who 
routinely work well beyond the established school day. The staff is comprised of 25 regular classroom teachers, a Title I 
Intervention Teacher, two Special Ed
ucation Teachers, a School Psychologist, a Speech and Language Specialist, two 
Transitional Kindergarten Teachers, five Dual Language Teachers, and 1 Adaptive Physical Education teacher.  The Mesa 
staff is highly qualified with 100% of the teaching staff N
CLB compliant, fully credentialed, and CLAD certified (or its 
equivalent). All of the teachers have been teaching five years or more. Mesa provides a strong support network for all 
teachers through collaboration and on
-
site mentorships. The staff is commit
ted to preserving Mesa's tradition of academic 
excellence by maintaining high expectations and standards for student achievement. Teachers employ a wide range of 
effective teaching strategies and instructional methodologies and engage in professional devel
opment activities to 
maintain a working knowledge of the findings of current educational research. Our critical priority this year is to provide 
effective first instruction, as well as develop critical thinking skills. Mesa teachers have been trained in To
tal Education 
System Support (TESS), and our teachers have helped the district develop and design lessons, pacing guides, and common 
assessments which will support Effective First Instruction. This year all of our teachers attended Common Core Training, 
Wr
ite from the Beginning and Beyond training, and Thinking Maps. All Mesa teachers will be trained for 12 hours 
throughout the year as we embark on a schoolwide mission to improve students' thinking and writing skills with an 
emphasis on narrative and exposi
tory writing (WFTBB).
 
 
Mesa's staff serves a diverse population as indicated by the 11 different languages spoken by Mesa students. Predominant 
groups include Hispanic (67%), Caucasian (14%), Asian (11%), Filipino (3%), and African American (3%). Services 
are 
provided for Gifted and Talented students (8%) who are clustered into GATE classes and receive differentiated instruction 
daily. English Language Learners (8%) are provided specially designed academic instruction in English by CLAD certified 
teachers. 
Our SED population has increased from last year with 48% of our students currently receiving Free and Reduced 
Lunch. We were awarded the Title I Achievement School Award, and this is the third year we will receive Title I funding. 
Students respect one anot
her and take pride in their school. Mesa's exemplary CAASPP scores are just one indicator of 
students' determination to fulfill their highest potential. Mesa's students continue to learn and have become student 
leaders, academic scholarship winners, and st
ar athletes at the high school level.

Mesa is proud of its many accomplishments. Through the fundraising efforts of dedicated volunteers, PTA has continued 
to provide students with access to specialized and up
-
to
-
date learning materials. Over the past thr
ee years our PTA and 
community have helped students raise over $45,000 to support educational opportunities including field trips for every 
classroom, as well as high quality assemblies. In 2003, Mesa opened a new and significantly larger library facility,
 
which 
houses over 11,500 books, magazines, and reference materials for student use. Donations from our Spring Read

resources, and the strong collaboration among all members of the Mesa community continue to support students in 
achieving academic excellence.
 
 
M
ESA VISION AND MISSION STATEMENT
 
Mesa Elementary School endeavors to provide a safe, educational environment which nurtures and empowers students 
to become balanced and productive citizens. As part of this vision, we hope to instill in our students a sense
 
of integrity 
and compassion, a quest for knowledge and achievement, a respect for diversity, and an appreciation of their community. 
We strive to help students not only develop their intellectual intelligence, but their emotional intelligence as well. It 
is our 
expectation that when students leave Mesa Elementary School they will have a firm foundation of academic skills, as well 
as the ability to establish positive interpersonal relationships and collaborate with others. They will be able to discern ri
ght
 
from wrong and make ethical judgments to become contributing members of society. Mesa Elementary School provides 
the keys to successfully unlocking the doors of the future and each child holds a key.
 
 
INSTRUCTIONAL FOCUS
 
Students at Mesa 
Elementary School will effectively communicate their reasoning through speaking, writing, and visual 
representation. These strategies will be applied in all content areas and supported through 3 research
-
based instructional 
strategies: 1) Thinking Maps; 2)
 
Write from the Beginning and Beyond; and 3) ACE (Answer, Cite, Explain).

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education 
population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a
re aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisf
y the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and 
staff is a primary concern at every school throughout the District. Each school complies with laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring
 
student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted regularly throughout the school year. Each school annually participates in the "Great California ShakeOut". The 
school's Safe School Plans are reviewed annually by a law en
forcement officer from the West Covina Police Department. 
The document is "fluid" and updates are completed as needed. For example, updates are completed if a school discipline 
policy is added or modified, changes are made to the campus map, additions and/
or modifications are made to the 
telephone trees, etc. All visitors must check in at the school office and wear a visitor badge while on school grounds. Durin
g 
lunch, recesses, and before and after school, staff members supervise students and school ground
s, including the cafeteria 
and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by 
administrators, other school staff members, and Los Angeles County Office of Education staff members. It is reviewed
, 
approved, and evaluated by the School Site Council in cooperation with local law enforcement in order to comply with 
Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. 
Components of th
e Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from 
school, sexual harassment policy, and 
suspension and expulsion policies. The plan is reviewed annually with school staff. 
An updated copy is available to the public at the school and District Office.
