Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Circle View School, we believe in meeting the needs of children through an assessment
-
driven standards
-
based 
approach to instruction. Our teachers use 
the most effective teaching strategies to help every child achieve their greatest 

students to soar to new heights!
 
 
At Circle View, each
 
classroom is a warm and positive learning environment with a clear student
-
centered focus. Student 
work is showcased on bulletin boards that reflect Common Core/California State Standards in all content areas. Teachers 
are knowledgeable about each child's
 
skills relative to grade level standards and differentiate the instructional program 
according to the student's needs. A comprehensive literacy program, powerful mathematical experiences, and active 
engagement activities stimulate and solidify high levels
 
of learning. Circle View, along with Star View, houses the Gifted 
and Talented Education (GATE) Magnet program for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades. Over 200 students in the Magnet program 
received a differentiated curriculum, meeting advanced skills and needs, e
specially in the area of critical thinking, research, 
and by nurturing elements of depth, complexity, enrichment and acceleration.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In November of 2016, the Ocean View School 
District (OVSD) passed Measure R, a general obligation bond, in the amount 
of 169 million dollars. This is the first bond ever passed in the 143 year history of OVSD. The bond program is designed to 
transform the aging fleet of 1960/1970 era schools into m
odern, contemporary learning environments. Construction 
started in late June of 2018 and is anticipated to take approximately eight years to complete ending somewhere in the 
2024/2025 school year.
 
 
The District currently embraces a systematic approach to m
aintaining the current facilities to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and provide an inspirational educational environment for our students to learn, grow, and be challenged. 
District maintenance and site custodial staff work in a coordinated manne
r to ensure that the repairs and operational 
items necessary to keep the schools in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A comprehensive work order 
system is utilized by school and District staff to communicate both routine and non
-
routine main
tenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

Restrooms are 
checked regularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening 
custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of 
study.

collaboration and the other two Wednesdays are for collaboration and teacher planning. Middle School will have 10 early 
release Thursdays starting in the 2019

riting in science, and training teachers to conduct a History
-
Social Science pilot of instructional 
materials. All schools have been working on Social
-
Emotional learning, Positive Behavior Instructional Support (PBIS), and

ined in restorative practices. Throughout the year, teaching staff are provided the 
opportunity to participate in District
-
