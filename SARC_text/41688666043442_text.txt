By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Cipriani Elementary is located in the beautiful hills of Belmont, California. We are a relatively small school, serving 459 
students from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade.  The warmth
, compassion, and commitment of the community are 
abundantly evident as soon as you walk on campus. We strive to create a safe learning environment where teachers, 
students, and parents support each other in pursuit of the knowledge and insight that leads 
to high academic achievement 
and success for all students.   Unique and significant contributions of individual members add richness to the results. We 
believe in sharing the decisions, the responsibility and the commitment to our vision of educational exc
ellence among all 
members of our school community.
 
 
We are a California Distinguished School Award recipient.  Our student population performs quite well on the state 
assessments, with 79% of our students meeting or exceeding grade
-

th English Language Arts and 
Mathematics.  We are committed to providing high
-
quality education to our diverse student body. We provide a 
challenging curriculum, quality teachers, and an atmosphere that emphasizes: communication, collaboration, and 
continu
ous improvement.  Additionally, we believe exemplary scholars possess a growth mindset and demonstrate 

the curriculum and our teachin
g practices.
 
 
Although we pride ourselves on high achievement scores and successes,  our mission is of much more than academic rigor.  
We recognize the importance of nurturing the social and emotional growth, health, and well
-
being of our children.  
Throug

Award winning Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) school.   Our school rules of Be 
Safe, Be Respectful and Be Responsible are widely and positively reinforced throu
ghout the school from the very first day. 
Positive student behavior and community service are amply incentivized.  In addition to our PBIS system, we are working 
to implement community circles, mindfulness and restorative practices to strengthen our commun
ity.
 
 
Cipriani Elementary encompasses diverse interests, languages, and experiences.  Yet, we are united by a common goal: to 
create a community where all children feel welcomed, loved, challenged, inspired and important.  We work towards 
building communit

which all students can excel.
 
 
Mission Statement: Encouraging Excellence in Everyone
 
 
Cipriani School seeks to create a safe learning environment where teachers, students, and parents, support each other in 
pursuit of the knowledge and insight that lead to high academic achievement and success for all students. We want 
Cipriani students to 
attain a strong academic and social foundation, become global thinkers who make responsible 
decisions, develop confidence, work with persistence and determination, communicate effectively, as well as value and 
learn from differences. Unique and significant
 
contributions of individual members add richness to the results. We believe 
in sharing the decisions, the responsibility, and the commitment to our vision of encouraging excellence in everyone with 
a broad base of shared leadership that is inclusive by de
sign.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Age of Buildings: This school has 16 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a music room/staff room and administrative offices. 
The main buildings were 
constructed in 1954 and modernized between 1994 and 2003. In 2013, an extensive remodel of 
the school was completed. In February 2017, we started a construction project to expand our school, improve the 
playground, and add the following spaces: 2 new after
care classrooms, 7 new classrooms, a dedicated library, elective 
rooms, and a staff room.
 
 
Condition: In the summer of 2013, the building underwent substantial remodeling that totaled about $6,539,076. The 
scope of the project included 
modernization of every classroom, multi
-

area, significant concrete work for ADA compliance, playground improvements for Kindergarten area and back blacktop 
area including new surface under play structure, shade structure for lu
nch area, fencing for security, security locks and 
shades for increased classroom safety). New exterior painting, landscaping, and gardens contributed to the beauty of the 
campus. Additional and replacement cabinets were added to the classrooms during the 
2013
-
2014 school year. The 
playground ball walls were refurbished and subsequently painted with a mural. The HVAC system in the MUR experienced 
an upgrade as the air conditioning was added in 2016. In February 2017, the school underwent extensive expansion
 
and 
remodeling detailed above. Sewer pipes were repaired and landscaping work to ensure the safety of students was 
completed in the summer of 2018.
 
 
Cleaning Standards: The District has adopted cleaning standards for each school, and a copy is available i

office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop and implement cleaning practices that ensure a clean 
and safe school campus. Steps are taken to ensure that students are involved in the care taking of the school as we
ll in 
the capacity of a Green Team, a student
-
led community service effort.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff, assisted as necessary by outside contractors, keep the school in good 
repair. Work orders are completed in a timely manner and 
submitted via email to the Facilities Manager.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cipriani holds monthly fire drills (evacuation drills) and participates in the partnership with the San Mateo Big Five safety
 
protocols. This has provided our school with a consistent approach to managing the five defined types of emergencies and 
having co
nsistent procedures to follow across the County. We routinely practice drills throughout the year as a school site. 
The principal participated in a Big Five cohort training at the County level with community partners and other schools.
 
 
Visitors to the sch
ool campus are required to register in the office and wear a visitor's badge while on campus. Parent 
volunteers are required to wear volunteer badges.
 
 
In the event of an emergency such as earthquake, fire, power failure or any event that interrupts school
, Cipriani School 
staff will respond as follows:
 
 
In the event of a major disaster (fire, earthquake, flood, chemical spill, power failure, civil disturbance) during school ho
urs, 
children will be kept at school. They will be released only to previously au
thorized individuals. The exception would be in 
the event of a serious injury when we would send the child for emergency medical care. Each child's emergency 
information is the primary source used to locate parents or the people designated to pick up the c
hild. Children will NOT 
be released to anyone who is not on this emergency list. It is imperative that each child's emergency information is kept 
current and accurate.
 
 
Telephone systems quickly become overloaded in an emergency, so parents are requested to refrain from calling the 
school. Instead, they should come to school or send an authorized person to pick up their child. They should check local 
radio and television 
stations for information during local disasters and emergencies. Children should be made familiar 
with these stations and their roles in local emergencies.
 
 
Cipriani School has plans for responding to emergency situations such as earthquakes, chemical spil
ls, power failures, fires, 
civil disturbances, and any other event that interrupts regular school activity. Every month, children participate in safety 
drills designed to help educate them about the protocols that are in place during an emergency. They are
 
empowered to 
follow school emergency protocols because they become routine.

Safety plans are updated in August of every school year and distributed to staff members. During the staff meetings in 
August and September, the plans are reviewed and the locati
on of supplies is discussed. This is the fifth year of 
implementing the Big Five safety protocols. These coordinated efforts have given schools a consistent approach to 
evacuation, earthquakes, secure campus, lockdown/barricade, and shelter in place proced
ures.
 
 
A strong partnership exists between the Belmont Police Department and Cipriani School. Our School Resource Officer 
visits regularly and responds to concerns immediately. Many of the students and parents know this person personally as 
he makes a poin
t of being a presence here. He worked directly with our fifth
-
grade students to promote safe schools and 
good decision making.
