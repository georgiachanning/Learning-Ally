By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2019
 
 
New Haven Unified School District held a Public Hearing on October 15, 2019, and determined that each school within the 
District has suf

settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual 
standards
-
aligned textbooks  
or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take 
home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school 
the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for 
parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-

this reason, the school continually searches for avenues to involve parents and the community to participate in the 
education of its students. De
laine Eastin has a strong Parent Teacher Club (PTC) (https://sites.google.com/site/eastinptc/) 
which hold monthly meetings on site that are open to all community member. Our PTC hosts a number of events, both as 
fundraisers and a community involvement even
ts. Delaine Eastin Elementary also maintains a school website 
(https://eas.mynhusd.org/) with an up to date community calendar as well as links to current information and 
opportunities for students to participate in events on the school campus. The site pr
incipal sends out regular newsletters 
which keep the community informed about upcoming events and opportunities to participate at the school level and 
provide input. Delaine Eastin holds monthly School Site Council meetings which are open to the public and
 
published on 
the school website, school calendar and the Principal's Newsletter. In addition, we host English Language Advisory 
Committee meetings three times per year to inform and engage the parents of our English Language Learners. This school 
year we 
have hosted multiple meetings focused on the performance and experience of our African American students 
however, we have not been successful in getting parents to attend.
