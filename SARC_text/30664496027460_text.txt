By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvem
ents (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Supervision and Safety
 
 
Students are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. Noon Duty Supervisors are present during all 
recesses and lunches. We have Noon Supervisors on both our Kindergarten yard and on the upper field for 1st
-
 
6th graders. 
Our Principal is vi
sible and observes both formally and informally for safety conditions. Our District and PTA work diligently 
with our Principal and staff to ensure and maintain emergency lighting, an emergency shed, and supplies.
 
 
The school facility has sufficient classro
om, playground, and staff spaces to support teaching and learning. First through 
sixth graders enjoy the upper field for recesses, while Preschool, TK, and kindergartners have their own space for outdoor 
play. We also enjoy an outdoor classroom in the amph
itheater and additional outside learning space on the lunch tables 
near the amphitheater, and the benches surrounding our rose garden. The core rooms, that connect four classrooms each 
in the permanent wings, serve as wonderful learning spaces for flexible
 
groupings of students and small group instruction.
 
 
The general condition of Mariposa facilities is good and is cleaned on a regular basis. 
 
Our teaching and support staff work 
closely with our custodial staff to ensure that clean up happens after special
 
events and activities. We also have a list in 
the lounge that teachers can add to informing our custodians of
 
classroom needs. They check this list daily to meet the 
needs of staff. This communication ensures that our teachers are supported by our custodi
ans.
 
 
The District makes it a priority to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
strict 
uses a facility survey called Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California Allocation Board and
 
Office 
of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
 
This school has 25 classrooms, a multipurpose/cafeteria room, a Library/Computer Lab, an office with teacher workroom 
and a Health Clerk's Office. We also enjoy an o
utdoor amphitheater. The main campus was built in 1967. Additions were 
constructed later with portable classrooms and a Library/Computer Lab.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maint
enance supervisors are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service 
and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority. As of
 
January, 2020, none of the eight emergency conditions cited in 
Education Code 17592.72 exist at this school. Our current Facilities Inspection Tool was completed in January, 2020.
 
 
Cleaning P
rocess and Schedule
 
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
is available at the district office. The Principal works closely with the day and night custodial staff to develo
p cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school events. Parents and visitors are 
welcomed and required to check in at the school office upon arrival
 

return to th
e school office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, assigned staff members 
supervise students and school grounds, including the cafeteria, outdoor amphitheater, and playgrounds, to ensure a safe 
and orderly environment. Sup
ervision begins at 8:30 a.m. and our school starts daily at 8:45 a.m.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The 
plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and ord
erly learning environment. Each school includes the 
following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency policies related to suspension
 
and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
Annually, th
e school evaluates and updates the plan. It was most recently approved by our School Site Council members 
October 25th of 2019. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District 
staff in the fall, at the s
tart of each school year. We have monthly school fire drills, duck and cover, and lock
-
down drills 
throughout the year.
 
 
Our evacuation site is located on our upper field playground.
 
 
Students line up by homeroom on 
their classroom number. Our off
-
campus e
vacuation site is Memory Gardens Memorial Park & Mortuary off of 
Central. 
 
Within the first few days of the school year, the Principal reviews school rules and procedures with each class 
grades 1
-
6. 
 
A copy of the rules is included in our school folder, Pa
rent Handbook, and the school Agenda planner for 
grades 3
-
6. An AED life support system is available for emergencies located in the school nurse's office.

Based on standardized test scores and benchmark assessments, 
Mariposa's staff
 
develops a plan for training activities 
throughout the year to improve instruction and to increase student proficiency. The California Department of Education 
requires schools to develop improvement plans (
School Plan
 
for Student Achieveme
nt) based upon analysis of pupil 
achievement in meeting State standards for student proficiency. Each year, the plan is reviewed and updated to reflect 

 
Our three main goals have been in the areas of: E

Arts, Math, and the the continued implementation of PBIS.
 
 
All school goals are connected with our District's LCAP as well.
 
 
 
 
During the 2017

2020 school years, District specialists, school leadership teams, and teachers in grade levels, r
eviewed 
and updated achievement plans using student assessment data (State testing and District interim benchmark assessment 
results) and survey responses. Findings were used to choose staff development workshops for District

services, workshops, and Professional Learning Community (PLC)
 
 
meetings. Teachers 
district wide have early release or late
