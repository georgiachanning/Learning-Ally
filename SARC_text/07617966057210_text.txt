By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vision: We will encourage and engage the whole child to become productive community members.
 
 
Mission S
tatement: Our students, through high expectations and continuous growth, develop academically, emotionally, 
socially and physically.
 
 
E. M. Downer Elementary is a preschool through 6th
-
grade school and includes a Spanish/English Dual Language 
Immersion Pro
gram. The staff at E.M. Downer Elementary School provides a standards
-
based, comprehensive 
instructional program using common practices that are research
-
based teaching strategies. The staff creates an 
environment that is student
-
centered, safe, and engagi
ng.
 
 
We occupy a beautiful campus that was completed in February of 2008. The school has two main buildings. One building 
houses the classrooms, library, STEAM Lab, Wellness Center, Professional Development/Coaching Room. The second 
building houses the adm
inistration office, cafeteria and gym with a stage. The student population is 80% Latino, 8% African 
American, 5% Southeast Asian, 4% Native American, 2% white, and 1% other. The staff is composed of experienced 
teachers, many of whom have worked at the sc
hool for many years and many who are bilingual and culturally diverse.
 
 
Academics:
 
At E.M. Downer, we have a Dual Language Immersion and Special Education programs. E. M. Downer staff provides a 
rigorous Common Core State Standards curriculum and a positiv
e school climate that helps students grow academically. 
Our school goals are to provide a well
-
resourced and rigorous instructional program that addresses reading, writing, 
listening, speaking, and reasoning. At E.M. Downer, students engage in multiple lea
rning activities such as workshop based 
learning, study trips, integrated technology, small group instruction, social emotional learning, and language development 
in an integrated and designated time for English Language Development (E.L.D) and Academic La
nguage Development 
(A.L.D.). We have been implementing the district adopted curriculum, Teachers College Reading and Writing Program to 
support in reading and writing through a workshop model. We also have an instructional coach who supports academic 
progr
amming, teachers, and students.
 
 
An intervention program based on the Multi
-
tiered System of Support (MTSS) model is in place. We have an Academic 
Support Team that focuses on our intervention program to support students and teachers to develop academic gr
owth 

the workshop model for small group instruction. Teachers work with students on lessons designed specifically for their 
needs wh
ile other students work independently in a focused and directed way. The differentiation of lessons enables 
teachers to provide access and challenges to every student at an appropriate learning level, resulting in academic growth 
for all students. Student 
progress is monitored every six weeks to determine success or the need for modified instruction.

After School Program:
 
There is a large after
-
school program that serves over 120 students daily. There are multiple academic and elective based 
programs
 
in place including thematic academic units, homework tutoring, music, visual art, dance, yoga, cooking, 
kickboxing, physical activities & sports. One of the programs is called Sound Minds which was launched in 2011 with the 
generous support of the Califor
nia Symphony. Students receive violin and cello instruction, chorus, music theory and 
academic support three days a week. 2nd through 6th grade students are invited to participate in this free program. We 
have a highly popular dance group called the Dancin

-
 
6th grade students 
have the opportunity to learn guitar, drums, keyboard and chorus through our modern band program.
 
 
 
Social and Emotional Learning:
 
Research indicates that social and academic learning go ha
nd in hand. At E.M. Downer Elementary School, we believe in 
the importance of social and emotional growth. When a student feels emotionally safe, happy and known, they are ready 
to learn. Teachers and staff focus on knowing students individually, developme
ntally and culturally and seek to provide a 
school and classroom culture where relationships are positive, nurturing and cooperative. We have a full
-
time Wellness 
Coordinator, a full
-
time child therapist and a school psychologist who support our students, 
teachers, and community. We 
also have a Beacon director who oversees all non
-
academic programs and works with our school partnerships.
 
 
Creativity and Movement:
 
We nurture student creativity and cultivate a healthy active environment. The staff has a stron
g belief in the 
transformative power of the arts. Students participate in all the art disciplines (visual art, drama, dance, media arts, and 
music) during their experience at our school. We have a visual art teacher one day a week who teaches the elements 
of 
art to all grade levels throughout the year. We also have an art integration showcase and multiple student performances 
throughout the year. Some of the performances and events include: Sidewalk Chalk Festival, Dia de los Muertos (Day of 
the Dead) Art a
nd Craft Faire, Winter Show and Festival of Lights, 6th Grade Photo Exhibit, Black History Performance, 
Multicultural Fair, and the Arts Integration Showcase.
 
Each grade level has a flagship art project that students participate in that is facilitated by a
 
local or visiting teaching artist.
 
 
We believe in the importance of students engaging in movement to promote health, facilitate learning and strengthen 
community. Dragons in Motion, a daily morning exercise routine, promotes individual and school pride an
d gives students 
a brain boost creating a healthy community ready to learn. We have school
-
wide exercise events such as our Turkey Trot, 

 
 
Community Partners:
 
Developing and maintaining 
partnerships with community based organizations and governmental agencies are a priority 
for the staff. Partnerships are in place with the City of San Pablo, Contra Costa County Dental Health Program, Food Bank 
of the East Bay, Read Aloud Volunteer Program
, Children Rising of Alameda County, World Story Exchange, East Bay Center 
for the Performing Arts, Richmond Art Center, the California Symphony, Quinan Street Project, West Contra Costa Unified 
District Adult Education Program, Jr. Achievement, Bay Area C
ommunity Resources, and the YMCA Counseling Program.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Mo
st Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that 
the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

E.M. Downer has weekly Friday morning Parent Meetings. All parents are invited to attend. These Friday morning meetings 
address a variety of topics regarding students and families include testing, health,
 
nutrition, conferencing, parenting skills, 
and homework and student achievement. There is a dedicated group of volunteers who support teachers by performing 
collating, printing and preparation of materials. Parents also help to support school
-
wide activit
ies. Parents participated 
in pre
-
school transition meetings to familiarize them with expectations for kindergarten. The School Community Outreach 
Worker coordinates volunteer opportunities for parents. Many parents work on a daily basis in classrooms and t
he office. 
Parents are actively sought to accompany classes on study trips, run the Book Fair, help distribute food from the White 
Pony Express and Food Bank of Contra Costa, assist on the Book Give Away Days. Parents are also involved in planning 
events s
uch as the Halloween / Fall Harvest Parade, the Winter Holiday show and they run the School Carnival. In 
collaboration with the City of San Pablo, we have a full time Beacon School Coordinator. A responsibility of that position 
is to increase parent partic
ipation and to find additional resources for students and their parents.
 
 
School Site Council: Every elementary school must have a School Site Council composed of five parents or community 
members, the principal, three classroom teachers, and one other sta
ff member (Education Code Section 52852). All 
parents are welcome to attend the monthly meetings of the School Site Council. The meetings are held on the 3rd 
Thursday of each month.
 
 
We also have an African American Parent Advisory Committee (AAPAC) and an
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school 
operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable
 
in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe 
and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and t
he District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).

Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the school's achievement efforts. The teaching staff 
meets on a weekly basis, for 1 hour to develop teaching skills, review student data and plan instruction that promotes 
mastery of the 
learning standards. During these collaboration sessions, teachers jointly plan lessons and instructional 
activities for the reading language arts program. During the week before school starts, the staff meets to develop learning 
or review teaching techniqu
es, become familiar with newly adopted programs, and develops a consensus for procedures 
and policies for student behavior and activities. Implementation of the Common Core State Standards is a priority for the 
staff, with a focus on multiple methods in so
lving problems in math, as well as reading and analyzing non
-
fiction text. 
Throughout the last few years, teachers and administrators have been attending professional development for Teachers 
College Reading and Writing Program. Our Instructional Leadershi
p Team along with our Instructional Coach guides the 
development of our professional development activities. Our Principal, Vice Principal, and Instructional Coach meet with 
teachers to discuss classroom instructional strategies. They also provide in
-
class
room model lessons to teachers, as 
requested or deemed necessary. This year the focus has been on the implementation of common teaching practices with 
a sense of urgency to grow academically, socially, emotionally, and physically.
