Principal's Message 
 
I would like to welcome you to Sycamore Elementary School's annual School Accountability Report 
Card. In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual 
School Accountability Report Card that fulfills state and fed
eral disclosure requirements. We hope 
parents/guardians will find it informative and full of valuable information about our academic 
achievement, professional staff, curricular programs, instructional materials, safety procedures, 
classroom environment, an
d facilities. 
 
 
Sycamore Elementary School provides a stimulating, multi
-
age learning environment. We involve 
students in learning choices in order to nurture skills of citizenship and develop life
-
long learners. 
The challenging, standards
-
based curriculum
 
is taught by a staff of dedicated professionals and 
based on individual needs of students. Regular monitoring of student progress helps us refine the 
instructional program so students can achieve academic proficiency. 
 
 
We are committed to providing the b
est educational program possible for Sycamore Elementary 
School's students, and we are convinced this requires a partnership between school, home and 
community. We welcome any suggestions or questions you may have about the information 
contained in this re
port or about the school. Together, through our hard work, our students will be 
challenged to reach their maximum potential. 
 
 
Mission Statement 
 
 
Sycamore students will: 
 

 
see themselves as members of a larger world community;
 

 
be active learners 
-
 
they wil
l be curious, will question, will take risks and will apply 
knowledge to real situations and issues;
 

 
gain formal knowledge as indicated in California Standards;
 

 
see themselves as lifelong learners and as such will find value and joy in learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availa
bility of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Sycamore Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California State S
tandards. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state
's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials (English language arts, math, science, and social sc
ience).
 
 
On Thur
sday, October 17, 2019, the Claremont Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify the exten
t to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution #06
-
2020
 
which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both
, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content of 
the cur
riculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their 
visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the  2018
-
19 school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class an
d to take home. These materials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and 
functional through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. 
Sycamore Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1936; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facil
ities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for stu
dents and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in 
good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine mai
ntenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attent
ion prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. One 
day custodian and one evening custodian are assigned to Sycamore Elementary School. The day custodian is responsible 
for:
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
Trash removal
 
 
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanline
ss and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Common use area cleaning
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school sa
fety issues.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority:
 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
