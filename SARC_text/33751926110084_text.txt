By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cal
ifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with altern
ate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for
 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

involvement daily, we also have a strong Parent Teacher Association and multiple opportunities throughout the year for 
parents to be involved.   Other opportunities for par

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan. The plan 
covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and egress and ensuring a safe and orderly environment. 
Additionally, 
the plan includes data on suspensions and expulsions as well as school and district crime data.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is full enclosed by fencing. School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at the
 
front office prior 
to entering campus. In instances of emergency, we use an automated telephone system to contact 
parents with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our schools conducts fire, earthquake and lockdown 
drill
s regularly throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire 
drill each month they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the school year, and three 
lockdown drills eac
h school year. High Schools are required to have two fire drills and two earthquake drills.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, 
multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based tra
ining sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instruction
al practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide instructional support as teacher
 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New 
State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curriculum and assessments. Teams began by identifying 
priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to
 
facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and
 
grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data and transition to New State 
St
andards.
