School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

November 2019
 
 
Our textbooks are from 
the most recent State

approved list and consistent with the content and cycles of the Curriculum 
Frameworks. Each student has access to his or her own textbooks and instructional materials to use in class and to take 
home. In our most recent adoption, each
 
grade level was provided with the opportunity to examine the choices for math 
and ELA adoption. Each teacher gave a first, second, and third choice. The results were compiled into a grade level 
recommendation. The District Best Practices Committee analyze
d those recommendations and a recommendation was 
given to the Superintendent and School Board.   The teacher's first recommendation was adopted.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Lincoln Elementary School was originally constructed in 1952 and has been regularly maintained. The Lincoln Elementary 
School campus is currently comprised of 31 classrooms, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, a library, one co
mputer lab, one 
staff lounge, and a playground. There are three custodians that work overlapping shifts, a grounds team, and a support 
maintenance staff. The teachers, principal, and classified staff provide supervision before, during, and after school.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the custodial staff of three to ensure that the cleaning of the school is 
maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the
 
District. A summary of these standards is available at the District Office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manne
r. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority to emergency repairs.
 
 
Facility Improvements: New LED lights for the outdoor corridors and inside the buildings were added.  The school added 
fencing around the entire school.
  
A new telephone system was added.  The library was remodeled in the last couple of 
years.  Last year a new HVAC system was installed for the classrooms connected to that system.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents and the community are very supportive of the education program at Linco

on the School Site Council (SSC) and English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC.)   Parents also volunteer in classrooms 
and on field trips.  Our last parent survey had 261 of them returned.  Lincoln has many parents vol
unteer to help in their 
child's classroom. Lincoln Elementary School receives assistance from Kingsburg Community Assistance Programs (KCAPS). 
KCAPS provides students from needy families with backpacks, coats, clothes, and food.
 
 
Parents who wish to partic

Lincoln Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Safety of students 
and staff is a 
primary concern of Lincoln Elementary School. The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State earthquake standards. At the beginning of the year, the District 
Safety Committee meets to re
view safety issues. Key elements of the safety plan include: identifying the level of threat, 
protective options, staff initial action/response, incident coordinator, and incident management team.
 
 
In order to stay connected, the 
administrative staff all have cell phones and digital two
-
way radios for emergencies. There 
are many digital two
-
way radios on Lincoln's campus for staff to communicate with during emergency situations.  Fire 
drills are held monthly and earthquake and lock
down drills are held periodically too.
 
 
Teachers, paraprofessionals, and the principal supervise students throughout the day. There is a designated area for 
student drop
-
off and pickup.  The school is gated, with open access during non
-
school hours only. V
isitors must register 
at the office and receive identification badges that must be displayed at all times. Kingsburg Elementary Charter School 
District encourages volunteers in the classroom, field trips, and with special projects. All school volunteers in
 
direct contact 
with students are required to complete a District application form, provide evidence of a clear tuberculosis (TB) screening, 

omated 
record check. Volunteers working more than 10 days per month will need to fill out additional forms and be fingerprinted.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated on 11/14/2019.
