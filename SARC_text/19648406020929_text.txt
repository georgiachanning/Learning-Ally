About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Escalona's School Safety Committee updates the School Safety Plan annually each
 
October and trains the staff on safety procedures at that time. The 
plan includes information on disaster drills, evacuation routes, disaster teams, and the location of first
-
aid supplies. The School Site Council reviews, 
revises, and approves the School 
Safety Plan annually. It is available for review in the school's main office.  We practice fire drills each month, lockdown 
drills each trimester and Earthquake drills twice each year.  We maintain a storage shed that houses school
-
wide disaster supplies. 
 
Additionally, each 
classroom is equipped with a bucket that holds emergency equipment.  Supply and equipment inventories are conducted annually 
by the School Safety 
Committee. The emergency supply of food and water is replaced per their expiration dates.

Escalona
 
staff participated in professional development opportunities designed to clarify and facilitate the transition from curriculu
m and instruction 
based on California State Standards to the new curriculum and instructional strategies based on Common Core Stan
dards.
 
 
Common Core is a set of 
standards developed by the federal government in the hopes of unifying educational standards nationwide.
 
 
The professional development at Escalona 
highlighted the instructional shifts in English Language Arts, Mathematics, W
riting and the Integration of Technology Skills within the instructional 
content. Additionally, staff members were provided professional development in Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (Academic and Behavior) as well as in 
Professional Learning Communities,
 
 
Data Discussions, Cognitively Guided Instruction and Counting Collections.. 
 
 
On site professional development was 
conducted two times per month.  Escalona teachers were supported by district common core coaches
 
 
and on site  lead teachers.
