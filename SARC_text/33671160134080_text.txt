Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Parent involvement is 
supported and encouraged through committee work, instructional enrichment opportunities, 
inclusion in classroom activities, and participation in monthly family education nights and coffee talks with the principal. 
Parents have the opportunity to be involve
d in the School Site Council, English Language Advisory Committee, District 
English Language Advisory Committee, and Parent Advisory  Committee. The Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA) has made 
generous contributions through programs, fundraising, advocacy, a
nd leadership. Harvest Hill is grateful for the many 
hours contributed by parents and community volunteers. We have added a new parent involvement opportunity this year 
called GUARDIANS.  It allows parents to work with students before school, recess, lunch
, and after school to build positive 


sroom, participating 
in organized committees, and attending class and school
-
wide events. Parents are kept informed of school activities 
through the school website, email, Twitter, Facebook, Peachjar, and the school messenger system.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster 
preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the HHSA Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
pr
epare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency pro
cedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
HHSA staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, which include a leveled/colored
 

visitor is required to check
-
in using our Raptor 
system. HHSA Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly emergency drills 
and provides feedback.

Finally, school and district administrators immediately investig
ate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All HHSA staff take a strong stand against t
hreatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.
 
 
Our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system teaches and reinforces appropriate student behaviors. 
We foster social
-
emotional learning (SEL) skills developme
nt in the form of weekly lessons delivered school
-
wide to all 
students, supported by curriculum from SecondStep.org. The curriculum establishes high expectations for achievement 
by all students in every subject area, and students are supported by counselin
g services that include crisis counseling, peer 
counseling, and intervention programs.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared to 
increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on s
taff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been on t
he adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provided 
before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and administra
tors continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
