All

provide
 
quality
 
instruction
 
and
 
support
 
services
 
to
 
the
 
students.
 
New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
also
 
employs
 
seven
 
paraprofessionals,
 
all
 
of
 
whom
 
provide
 
direct
 
support
 
to
 
students
 
and
 
teachers.
 
The
 
entire
 
New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
staff
 
works
 
collaboratively
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
safe,
 
nurturing,
 
and
 
educational
 
environment.
  
English
 
Language
 
Arts
 
(ELA)
 
and
 
ELD
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
educational
 
focus.
  
The
 
teaching
 
staff,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
paraprofessionals,
 
work
 
closely
 
with
 
an
 
ELA/ELD
 
coach
 
on
 
implementing
 
Common
 
Core
 
State
 
Standards
 
in
 
a
 
differentiated
 
manner;
 
guaranteeing
 
all
 
students
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
core
 
curriculum.
 
Through
 
the
 
coaching
 
model,
 
the
 
staff
 
is
 
using
 
research
 
based
 
curriculum
 
to
 
deliver
 
lessons
 
with
 
proven
 
successful
 
instructional
 
strategies.
 
 
Students
 
are
 
encouraged
 
to
 
become
 
the
 
best
 
person
 
they
 
can
 
be;
 
to
 
develop
 
and
 
exemplify
 
good
 
character
 
traits,
 
while
 
setting
 
the
 
best
 
example
 
for
 
themselves
 
and
 
their
 
community.
  
Bullying,
 
in
 
any
 
form,
 
is
 
not
 
tolerated,
 
and
 
is
 
dealt
 
with
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
manner.
   
Outside
 
counseling
 
services
 
are
 
contracted
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
provide
 
students,
 
parents,
 
and
 
staff
 
with
 
individualized
 
support,
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
strategies.
  
The
 
safety
 
of
 
our
 
students
 
is
 
of
 
the
 
highest
 
priority.
  
Safety
 
drills
 
are
 
conducted
 
on
 
a
 
monthly
 
basis.
  
Each
 
drill
 
is
 
followed-up
 
by
 
staff
 
members
 
for
 
review,
 
clarification,
 
and
 
discussion
 
to
 
further
 
make
 
our
 
campus
 
safe
 
and
 
our
 
students
 
prepared.

New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
School
 
is
 
very
 
proud
 
of
 
the
 
pleasant
 
and
 
clean
 
environment
 
made
 
available
 
to
 
its
 
students
 
and
 
community.
 
Visitors
 
to
 
the
 
school
 
will
 
find
 
the
 
grounds
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
best
 
kept
 
at
 
any
 
school.
 
A
 
dedicated
 
maintenance
 
staff
 
works
 
tirelessly
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
graffiti-free
 
and
 
litter-free
 
grounds.
 
New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
School
 
takes
 
great
 
efforts
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
grounds
 
are
 
not
 
only
 
clean,but
 
safe,
 
and
 
functional.
 
To
 
assist
 
in
 
this
 
effort,
 
we
 
used
 
the
 
Facility
 
Inspection
 
Tool
 
(FIT)
 
instrument
 
developed
 
by
 
the
 
State
 
of
 
California
 
Office
 
of
 
Public
 
School
 
construction
 
to
 
determine
 
that
 
the
 
school
 
is
 
in
 
good
 
repair.
 
The
 
present
 
school
 
was
 
built
 
in
 
1950.
 
The
 
school
 
has
 
11
 
regular
 
classrooms,
 
one
 
Special
 
Education
 
classroom,
 
a
 
multipurpose
 
room,
 
a
 
portable
 
building
 
shared
 
by
 
the
 
After
 
School
 
Program
 
and
 
a
 
Reading
 
Intervention
 
Teacher,
 
and
 
a
 
portable
 
building
 
for
 
staff
 
members
 
to
 
work.
  
District
 
maintenance
 
staff
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
necessary
 
repairs
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
school
 
in
 
good
 
repair
 
and
 
in
 
working
 
order
 
are
 
completed
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
manner.
 
Emergency
 
repairs
 
are
 
always
 
given
 
the
 
highest
 
priority.
 
A
 
cleaning
 
schedule
 
has
 
been
 
developed,
 
and
 
is
 
followed
 
daily,
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
clean
 
and
 
safe
 
school.
  
It
 
is
 
the
 
goal
 
of
 
the
 
New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
School
 
Board
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
students
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
learn
 
with
 
the
 
assistance
 
of
 
updated
 
technology,
 
equipment,
 
and
 
facilities
 
that
 
allow
 
for
 
a
 
safe,
 
purposeful,
 
and
 
fun
 
learning
 
environment.
  
During
 
the
 
2017-18
 
school
 
year,
 
funds
 
from
 
Proposition
 
39
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
upgrade
 
safety
 
and
 
energy
 
efficiency
 
of
 
classrooms,
 
common
 
areas,
 
and
 
the
 
school
 
grounds.
  
Through
 
Proposition
 
39

Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
School
 
has
 
developed
 
a
 
Comprehensive
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
that
 
is
 
updated
 
and
 
reviewed
 
on
 
an
 
annual
 
basis.
  
The
 
safety
 
plan
 
primarily
 
addresses
 
issues
 
of
 
school
 
safety
 
pertaining
 
to
 
day-to-day
 
activities,
 
such
 
as
 
general
 
rules
 
for
 
maintaining
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
positive
 
school
 
environment.
 
A
 
variety
 
of
 
safety
 
drills
 
are
 
practiced
 
on
 
a
 
monthly
 
basis.
  
Drills
 
are
 
conducted
 
at
 
various
 
times
 
of
 
the
 
day
 
to
 
help
 
prepare
 
students
 
for
 
an
 
unexpected
 
event.
  
Individual
 
safety
 
issues
 
are
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
health
 
curriculum
 
including
 
facts
 
and
 
awareness
 
of
 
the
 
hazards
 
of
 
involvement
 
with
 
controlled
 
substances
 
and
 
tobacco.
   
Also
 
reflected
 
in
 
the
 
district
 
safety
 
plan
 
are
 
the
 
district
 
discrimination
 
and
 
harassment
 
board
 
policies,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
procedures
 
for
 
reporting
 
a
 
hate
 
crime.
  
The
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
safety
 
plan
 
has
 
been
 
reviewed
 
and
 
updated
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
the
 
Thornton
 
Fire
 
department
 
and
 
the
 
San
 
Joaquin
 
County
 
Sheriff's
 
Department.
  
The
 
2019-20
 
Emergency
 
Plan
 
is
 
scheduled
 
to
 
go
 
before
 
the
 
School
 
Board
 
in
 
February
 
2020
 
for
 
approval.

Along
 
with
 
regularly

staff
 
meetings
 
and
 
across
 
grade
 
collaboration,
 
professional
 
development
 
is
 
scheduled
 
for
 
teachers
 
and
 
paraprofessionals
 
throughout
 
the
 
instructional
 
year.
   
Teachers
 
are
 
offered
 
a
 
week
 
long
 
Teacher's
 
Institute
 
during
 
the
 
summer
 
break.
  
Prior
 
to
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
2019-20
 
school
 
year,
 
Paraprofessionals
 
were
 
provided
 
two
 
full
 
days
 
of
 
training.
  
Three
 
MOU's
 
have
 
been
 
established
 
with
 
San
 
Joaquin
 
County
 
Office
 
of
 
Education
 
(SJCOE):
 
(1)
 
Language
 
and
 
Literacy
 
Department,
 
(2)
 
STEM
 
Department,
 
and
 
(3)
 
Math
 
Department.
 
All
 
three
 
MOU's
 
provide
 
professional
 
development
 
through
 
a
 
coaching
 
model.
 
The
 
primary
 
focus
 
for
 
staff
 
development
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
teachers
 
and
 
paraprofessionals
 
with
 
timely,
 
well-researched,
 
standards-based
 
instructional
 
methodologies
 
and
 
information
 
that
 
will
 
increase
 
student
 
participation
 
and
 
achievement.
   
Teachers
 
are
 
also
 
provided
 
with
 
opportunities
 
to
 
attend
 
various
 
workshops
 
addressing
 
specific
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
relevant
 
to
 
individual
 
teacher
 
needs
 
and
 
areas
 
of
 
concentration.
  
New
 
Hope
 
Elementary
 
has
 
placed
 
their
 
focus
 
on
 
meeting
 
the
 
California
 
Common
 
Core
 
Standards,
 
NGSS,
 
and
 
the
 
daily
 
integration
 
of
 
technology.
  
The
 
MOU
 
established
 
with
 
the
 
STEM
 
Department,
 
assists
 
teachers
 
and
 
students
 
with
 
technology,
   
Students
 
in
 
grades
 
TK-8
 
have
 
an
