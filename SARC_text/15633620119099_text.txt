Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Miller Elementary has procedures and expectations to ensure a positive learning environment for all students. We believe 
in the motto of Respect, Responsibility, and Honesty. We believe that discipline is a process that uses teaching, modeling 
and other ap
propriate strategies to maintain the behaviors necessary to ensure a safe, orderly and productive learning 
environment by changing unacceptable behavior to acceptable behavior. Parents and students are informed of discipline 
policies at the beginning of ea
ch school year through classroom orientation as well as the Miller Parent Handbook.  We 
encourage good attendance because of its significant impact on student learning. Students with excessive tardies, 
truancies, or unexcused absences are subject to discip
linary action including detention and mandatory parent 
conferences.  Miller establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school 
experience. Appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incent
ives as well as assertive discipline 
and conflict resolution tools to further develop personal growth. Expulsions occur only when required by law or when all 
other alternatives are exhausted.

Our School Safety Plan was reviewed, discussed updated and  adop
ted in October 2019 by our site council made up of 
parents and staff. This plans provides all of our safeguards regarding our students. This includes earthquake, fire, lock 
down, shelter in place, an others. Our staff is aware of their roles in the event o
f an emergency and will respond 
accordingly. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe coming and 
going of our students. Staff receive in
-
service in emergency protocol and CPR. The District provides on
-
g
oing training in 
CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire and/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school 
site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. Identifying tags are issued to su
bstitute 
teachers, volunteers, and other visitors as they register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground 
are locked during school hours and staff members are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an 
emergency
. Our positive partnership with local law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns 
arise. Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Scheduled 
certificated supervision of students 
begins officially at 7:20 a.m. when the school opens and supervision ends at 2:45 p.m. 
.

The types of services funded with categorical funds include: 
 
 
Title I 
 
 
Title I, Part A (Title I) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low
-
income families to 
help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. Title I is designed to help students served by the 
program to achieve pro
ficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards. Title I schools with percentages of 
students from low
-
income families of at least 40 percent may use Title I funds, along with other Federal, State, and local 
funds, to operate a "school wide pr
ogram" to upgrade the instructional program for the whole school. Based on an analysis 
of student achievement data done be the school site, Title I resources may be used for professional development, 
supplemental instruction and intervention, parental invo
lvement, personalization and support for students with at
-
risk 
behaviors. Targeted assistance schools design, in consultation with parents, staff, and district staff, an instructional 
program to meet the needs of specifically identified students who are fa
iling, or most at risk of failing, to meet the State's 
challenging academic achievement standards . Both school wide and targeted assistance programs must use instructional 
strategies based on scientifically based research and implement parental involvemen
t activities.
 
 
Title II 
 
 
The district uses Title II funds to increase the academic achievement of all students by helping schools and district (1) 
improve teacher and principal quality through professional development and other activities and (2) providin
g low
-
income 
and minority students greater access to effective teachers, principals, and other school leaders.
 
 
Title III 
 
 
The district uses Title III funds to help ensure that children who are limited English proficient, including immigrant childr
en 
and youth, attain English proficiency, develop high levels of academic attainment in English, and meet the same 
challenging Stat
e academic content and student academic achievement standards as all children are expected to meet. 
The focus is on professional development for teachers across the district that will: 1). Improve the instruction and 
assessment of ELs; 2). Enhance the abil
ity of teachers to implement curriculum, and improve their instructional strategies
