Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional 
learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teach
ing and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all stude
nts receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vision 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design,
 
the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the 
transfer of that learning to the 

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. T
he outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, Calif
ornia 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articula
tion and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of 
student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, 
but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoi
ng examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 
Commun

Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ens
ure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and su
pport during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teache
r. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance,
 
and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
