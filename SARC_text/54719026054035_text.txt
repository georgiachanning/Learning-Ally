By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Earlimart Middle School is to promote the educational success of 
all students through high expectations, a 
commitment to excellence, and a comprehensive academic program. We believe that all students can excel academically 
and socially, and become responsible, productive members of our society. The mission of Earlimart 
School District is to 
provide a high
-
quality, rigorous, instructional program for all students in a nurturing environment that will prepare all to 
be college ready and productive members in their communities and in the greater society of the global economy
.
 
Our goals and focus are to increase student achievement in all subjects areas throughout the school year focusing on ELD, 
English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Reading Intervention as measured by summative and formative site, district, and 
state assess
ments.
 
 
Earlimart is an unincorporated rural town that is located approximately forty miles north of the City of Bakersfield and 
seventy miles south of Fresno. The community does not have an official governing body and as a result, Earlimart relies 
on the 
administrative services provided by the County of Tulare. Earlimart Middle School is in the Program Improvement 
process, and staff has worked with the Instructional Services Division of the Tulare County Office of Education and the 
Earlimart District Offic
e to improve curriculum and instruction.

Earlimart Middle School
 
sets a high priority upon ensuring that there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the 
school educational program. Textbook selection is done by the District, grade level, and subject area committees 
coordinated by District curriculum. All te
xts must be adopted from the most recent approved State matrices or local 
governing board approved lists. Textbook purchases are consistent with the content cycles of the California Curriculum 
Frameworks as District Instructional Material Funding and other
 
funding sources permit. Categorical funding also allows 
us to purchase supplementary instructional materials for English Learners in 6th to 8th grades to accelerate pupils as 
rapidly as possible towards grade level proficiency in reading, writing, and spe
aking. These materials are used in addition 
to the basic Reading/Language Arts and other core materials provided for every student and are correlated to State 
Standards
-
aligned textbooks each year with new adoption cycles per core area.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i
.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Commo
n Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Californ
ia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
EMS receives federal Title I funding that provides high
-
quality opportunities for students in high
-
poverty schools to meet 
district and
 
state content and performance standards. These funds are intended to provide services for students who are 
at risk of failing to meet state and district standards in Reading, Language Arts, and/or Mathematics. Services are to 
supplement the core curriculu
m program by providing increased instructional time, more intense instruction (individually 
or in small groups), and/or a different type of program using specially selected materials and/or instructional techniques. 
The intention of the program is to help 
students become successful (achieve grade level) in the core curriculum areas of 
reading, language arts, and mathematics. The Title I program requires parent participation and supports coordination with 
other programs that provide funding for specific purp
oses.
 
 
EMS also receives Title III funding to provide supplementary services for English Learners. The general purpose is to 
develop fluency in English as effectively and efficiently as possible, to provide equal opportunity for academic 
achievement, to pr
omote positive self
-
concepts, and to promote cross
-
cultural understanding. Funds are allocated based 
on the number of English Learners in the school.
 
 
In addition to that, EMS also receives LCFF money from the state to provide materials and services to ass
ist all students, 
with a focus on English Language Learners, low
-
income students, as well as foster children, to achieve academic success. 
The process for deciding how to use this budget is to assess the needs by data, and to gather input from staff, paren
ts, 
and all stakeholders through monthly LCAP meetings. We have focused on adding to technology as well as tutors and 
expanding Read 180 classrooms and Math 180. We have also purchased supplemental materials to assist with the teaching 
of the Common Core S
tandards. We have also contracted for teacher training and professional development for the staff.
 
 
Parents, students, and staff at Earlimart Middle School receive a wide variety of services.  Some of the services provided 
to parents include but are not li
mited to Parent Institute training and workshops, access to the parent portal, School Site 
Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, parent
-
teacher conferences, "At
-
Risk" Conferences,  Back to School Night, 
Dad's and Mom's Informational Breakfast, distr
ict
-
wide parent meetings, access to the parent liaison and parent center.  
Some of the services received by students include before or after school intervention, field trips, assemblies, access to 
English Learner Support Provider, and opportunities to lear
n outside the school day such as family Technology night and 
the district literacy fair.  Some of the services afforded to the staff of the school district include but are not limited 
professional development and training on a variety of subjects as needed
 
and appropriate focusing on: English Language 
Learners, Common Core State Standards, and Literacy, in addition they receive coaching by content experts, and access 
to a wide variety of curriculum and materials, and other resources.  These services provide
d are funded by a variety of 
revenue sources including but not limited Title I, Title II, Title III, LCAP, and the General Fund.

Professional development and Professional Learning Communities have become part of the daily work life of the EMS 
teaching teams. Teachers, administrators and support staff participate in workshops and seminars, coach one another, 
plan 
lessons together along with our Content Area Coaches, and collaborate for the purpose of student achievement. The 
professional learning community understands that teachers need collaboration time with one another. As a result, there 
is much support for pro
viding the time and resources teachers require for the purpose of changing their practice. Teachers 
are afforded opportunities to participate in curriculum development, learn and share successful methods of reaching 
students, discuss comprehensive and effi
cient ways to implement standards, and continue their own learning.
 
 
Earlimart Middle School's primary area of focus for staff development is on continuing the district mission of Creating  
Outstanding Readers and Writers in Earlimart (CORE) through intens
e Writers Workshop Training led by Tulare County 
Office of Education Content Experts. Earlimart Middle School provides comprehensive and ongoing professional 
development opportunities in all content areas such as but not limited to: ELD for English Languag
e Learners, Literacy, 
Common Core State Standards; Professional Learning Communities; DRA reading assessments, data analysis; development 
to support teachers and other personnel in the use of CCSS Units of study, California Adopted Curriculum; specific 
eng
agement and English Learner strategies, and first best instruction and practices for all students, focusing on English 
learners. Professional development and/or Professional Learning Communities transpire on a weekly basis as well as 
periodic full day sess
ions and summer sessions. Teachers are supported during implementation through in
-
class coaching, 
lesson planning assistance, demonstration lessons, principal and district walk
-
throughs, TCOE experts performing 
demonstration lessons, mega labs and micro la
bs to further Writers Workshop development, as well as common planning 
time at the end of the school day. In addition, Earlimart Middle School has early release every Wednesday which allows 
staff time for collaboration and other professional development op
portunities.
