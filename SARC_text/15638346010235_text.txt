About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (S
ARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textboo
ks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Vineland School are currently being aligned to the Common Core State Standards. 
Instructional materials are 
selected from the state's most recent list of stan
dards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows the State Board 
of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/ language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On August 20, 2018 the V
ineland School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks and instructional 
materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution No. #0820
-
01 which certifies as required by Educ
ation ยง60119 (1) 
that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the 
extent that each pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (
2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were provided to 
each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles a
nd content of the curriculum 
frameworks in math, science, hist
ory
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year,
 
the Vineland School District did not offer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not require the 
distribution of respective textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes significant efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities m
aintenance and campus 
supervision. Vineland School's 
original facilities were built in 1890; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to ke
ep the school in 
good condition are completed promptly. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In the last 12 months, the following improv
ements have been completed:
 

 
Recarpeted 5 classrooms
 

 
Remodeled/repaired Student Restroom
 

 
Repaired inadequate drainage
 

 
Repaired roofs of classrooms
 
* Replaced Water Heater
 
 
* Trimming and removal of hazardous trees
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the cu
stodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attention before students and staff
 
 
entering school grounds. Two day custodian and one evening custodians are assigned to Vineland School. The day custodians are
 
responsible
 
for:
 

 
General grounds maintenance
 

 
Trash removal
 
* Office cleaning
 
other duties assigned by the site administrator/supervisor
 
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodians are respo
nsible for
:

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Prior
ity 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our goal is to build strong relationships with families and comm
unity members to increase capacity to navigate the educational system in order to partner 
and advocate for educational opportunities and access to high quality teaching and learning to optimize student achievement. 
Students with parents 
who are involved in
 
their school tend to have fewer behavioral problems and better academic performance, and are more likely to complete high sch
ool 
than students whose parents are not involved in their school. 
 
 
To this end, the district and/or schools will designs, plans, 
and implements meaningful family and community engagement opportunities designed to 
involve and engage staff, families, and community members in activities in support of student learning. These activities will
 
build capacity for families 
and community memb
ers; provide opportunities for families and community members to develop and demonstrate leadership; provide opportunities 

r approp
riate access and 
equity for all families and community members.
