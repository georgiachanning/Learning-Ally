By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional in
formation about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments
, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pioneer Middle School provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision. Before the new middle school facilities were built, grades K
-
8 shared the existing elementary school campus. 
In 2000, the ma
in campus was completed; the cafeteria was added during the 2002
-
03 school year. During the 2007
-
08 
school year the Fifth grade students were moved to Pioneer Middle School, due to overcrowding at Pioneer Elementary 
School. During the 2008
-
09 school year F
rontier Elementary school opened. The 5th grade students moved off Pioneer 
Middle School, and went back to the elementary school. Pioneer Elementary and Frontier Elementary serves students K
-
5th grade. In the Summer of 2018 a landscaping project was comple
ted at Pioneer Middle School, which provided updated 
and new landscaping across campus.
 
 
New student walkways were designed and the campus curb appeal was enhanced 
tremendously, creating a beautiful and inviting campus for students and staff.
 
 
In addition,
 
ongoing maintenance and 
improvements ensure campus facilities remain up to date and provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Campus Maintenance
 
The PUESD MOT Director has established a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and
 
facilities 
are well
-
maintained and in good repair. The MOT Director also, manages larger projects that may require third party 
contractors. School custodians are qualified and equipped to handle minor routine repairs and maintenance projects.
 
 
An electron
ic, universal work order process is used districtwide; school staff forward a completed work order via e
-
mail 
for repairs and maintenance projects to the principal who reviews the request prior to submission to the maintenance 

intenance department receives the work order and prioritizes the request and based upon 
the nature of the request, assigns the project to either the school custodians or district maintenance staff. For urgent 
requests when verbal communication is required,
 
principals may contact the district maintenance staff using their school 
cell phone. 
 
In addition, the site assigned custodian has an internal radio in which direct communication with 
administration, office staff, and yard supervision can be made. Emergen
cy situations are given high priority and resolved 
immediately by school or district custodial staff, based upon the nature of the situation.
 
Pioneer Middle School schedules 
monthly Fire Drills, and the fire extinguishers are checked each month in complian
ce with state law.
 
 
Pioneer Union Elementary School District is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general 
housekeeping practices. The Board of Trustees along with district administration have approved and adopted specific 
cleanin
g standards, schedules, and policies for maintaining clean, safe environments for everyone on campus. The 

follows
-
up regularly each week
 
to ensure custodians are following established cleaning standards and surveying campus 

standards. Custodians are provided a detailed
 
schedule and follow clear guidelines that ensure learning areas are kept 
clean throughout the school day.

classrooms and campus grounds a
re well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. One 
full
-
time day custodian, one full
-
time evening custodian, and
 
one part
-
time evening custodian are assigned to Pioneer 
Middle School for
 
daily custodial duties and speci
al events. The principal communicates with the MOT Director to discuss 
school facilities and safety issues, custodial responsibilities, housekeeping needs, and maintenance schedules.
 
 
The district 
also
 
has assigned a
 
groundsperson to Pioneer Middle School,
 
that is responsible for the upkeep of the grounds at
 
the site.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian  inspects school facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues 
that require attention before staff and students arrive on campus. 
Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed 
immediately. Following a daily schedule, custodians check restrooms as needed as a proactive measure to keep facilities 
safe, sanitary, and stocked. Students share the responsibility to maintain a clean campus
 
and notify the school office when 

preparing facilities for mealtime activities; cleaning the cafeteria after meals are served; cleaning 
restrooms and 
classrooms;
 
and fulfilling basic custodial needs for students and staff. The evening custodians are responsible for setting 
up facilities for afternoon meetings and special events; cleaning classrooms, labs, library, restrooms, and office are
as; and 

bathrooms to promote a healthy environment and minimize germs and bacterial growth.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Pioneer Union Elementa
ry School District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program which provides 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building 
components; these typically include ro
ofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior 
painting, and floor systems.

The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

one Chromebooks for all  students, Google Apps for Education, Google Classroom, Positive Behavior Interventions 
and Supports (PBIS
), common core implementation in math and ELA, and NGSS exploration in Science. Staff participated 
in district wide trainings twice a year, weekly Wednesday afternoon staff workshops, and daily access to Professional 
Learning Communities (PLC's) through co
mmon collaboration periods. Our staff receives regular on
-
site Google Apps for 
Education and Google Classroom coaching through a partnership with Fresno County Office of Education 
(FCOE). 
 
Additionally, our science department has received training on the u
se of notebooks and implementation of NGSS, 
via Fresno County Office of Education and the Kings County Office of Education. Lastly, a team of teachers and 
administrators, in conjunction with Tulare County Office of Education (TCOE) and PBIS Champion School
s Model, have 
received regular training to continue to support our implementation of PBIS, as a result of these continued efforts, Pioneer 
Middle School received the honor of a Gold Medal for our PBIS Implementation.
 
 
Pioneer Middle School works in conjunc
tion with Pioneer Union Elementary School District to focus on specific areas of 
study and to improve instructional practices, address curricular needs or modifications, and implement new strategies for 
improved student learning. The Director of Learning S
upport Services and the Director of Student Services are available 
to assist administration in implementation needs through staff trainings, department and grade level coaching, and 
planning sessions. 
 
The Director of Educational Technology supports our on
e
-
to

one Chromebook initiative, providing an 
on
-
site technology assistant to Pioneer Middle School, and through regular communication with administration. 
 
The 
district Data Analyst provides necessary reports in easy to read formats to assist in regular da
ta
-
driven decision making 
for programmatic and student level needs.
 
 
New teachers are supported by peer coaching and extensive staff development. The Teacher Induction Program offers 
additional support and assistance to newly credentialed teachers. All new
 
teachers are provided with support over a two
-

-
related training from the Kings County Office Education, 
department supervisors, and qualified district personnel.
 
 
Significant professional devel
op and collaboration time has been dedicated to implementing tiered intervention systems 
focused on academics and behavior. MTSS continues to be a focus for our school, as this multi
-
tiered system of support 
provides us the opportunity to holistically supp
ort the growth of students both academically and personally.
 
 
Pioneer 
Middle School continues to build on academic and behavior supports to enhance the achievement of our students.
 
 
 
Professional development at Pioneer Middle School has and continues to be
 
focused on improving the culture and climate 
of our school as well as fostering personal and academic growth of our students.
 
 
In previous years professional 
development was focused on school climate and behavior interventions.
 
 
Through this training our 
school has developed 
a strong foundation to support the personal growth of our students.
 
 
Academic growth has become our new focus and as 
a result professional development has focused on instructional best practices, professional learning communities, data
 
talks, standards based instruction and learner objectives.
