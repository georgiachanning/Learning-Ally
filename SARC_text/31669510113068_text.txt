About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 20
19
-

Parents are considered key partners in the education of all students and are involved in a variety of ways including: 
 

 
Serving on an active Parent Teacher Club (PTC) coordinating monthly events/activities the support family and student engageme
nt. A
ctivities 
include an annual jog
-
a
-
thon, family dance and bowling nights, providing special assemblies, assisting in the funding of classroom and school 
materials, and supporting extra curricular activities.
 

 
Serving as a classroom Art Docent presenting mont
hly art lessons in classrooms using standards based art curriculum and materials provided 
by our PTC.
 

 

 

classrooms and provide extra supervision during lunches and recesses and they support keeping our students safe at morning dr
op off.
 

 
Serving on the School
 
Site Council which is responsible for monitoring the School Improvement Plan. In addition, our English Language 
Advisory Council allows families of our English Language Learners to offer feedback on our programs and guide our site priori
ties.
 

 
Volunteering
 

 

 
Attending class field trips scheduled throughout the school year.
 
 
We host at least one parent education night each trimester with a focus on our site goals
, interventions we offer and/or family nights that promote 
engagement of parents and children with our curriculum. This year, we also offered a "Happy Families" series that focused on 
areas of parent interest 
based on our Spring 2019 community input survey
. We attempt to offer all parent educational events during the school day and in the evening to meet 
the needs of all parent's schedules.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupi
l suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan, revised and approved in November of each year, lays out a plan for ensuring students learn in a secur
e and safe 
environment 
that covers routine and emergency procedures. Arrival and departure procedures are in place to ensure the safe and orderly in
gress/egress of students. 
The campus is closed during the day with all visitors checking in through the office. Staff m
onitors students at all times throughout the school day including 
movement about campus and recess times. Classroom doors have been designed to be locked from the inside should lock
-
down procedures be 
implemented. Each door on campus is equipped with addit
ional supports in case of the need to quickly secure them 
-
 
classroom doors have magnetic 
strips that cover the strike panel, and push through doors are secured with emergency straps that can be unlocked to allow fo
r instant door locking. We 
have added on 
'barracuda" to each classroom; it is next to an exterior door. Emergency procedures have been refreshed and are rehearsed thr
oughout 
the school year. This year, we are implementing more complex drills related to our Safety Response Protocol (SRP) in order 
to better assess our protocol's 
strengths and weaknesses. We have installed several additional surveillance cameras on campus, and are exploring the installa
tion of panic buttons in 
various campus spaces.
 
 
We use the PBIS system to support positive choices
 
on campus, and is used to recognize and reward students for positive behaviors that specifically 
contribute to a school climate that minimizes negative behaviors (such as bullying, fighting, teasing).
