By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
About South Sutter Charter School:
 
 
South Sutter Charter School (SSCS) opened in the fall of the 2005/2006 school year when many families were looking for 
a more personalized alternative to a traditional public school sett
ing. SSCS is a WASC accredited, independent charter 
school authorized by the Marcum Illinois School District in Sutter County and serves approximately 2,100 students TK
-
12th grade.  We believe in educating each of our students for the 21st century by provi
ding individualized learning 
opportunities that incorporate parental participation, choice, and involvement in curricula offered in personalized learning 
environments.  South Sutter values the role of the parent in the education of their children and we de
velop a personalized 

s 
and abilities, promoting and strengthening their capacity to learn that preserves one's innate passion for l
earning.
 
 
SSCS Educational Specialists (ESs) are California credentialed general education teachers who work closely with the 
families to serve the assigned student's educational needs as determined by a written student agreement between the 
parent and the
 
ES. The parent and ES work together toward student achievement and completion toward individual 
growth and state standards. They also work diligently to meet the major deadlines on the yearly paperwork timetable, as 
well as the paperwork deadlines for eac
h student. ESs serve their share of required proctor duties each school year and 
attend required professional growth training. Every ES must possess and maintain a valid teaching credential for every day 
they serve a student. South Sutter Charter School wa
s granted WASC accreditation in 2007 and the school received a six
-
year renewal in 2016.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
We believe in educating each of our students for the 21st century by providing individualized learning opportunities that 
incorporate parental part
icipation, choice and involvement in curricula offered in personalized learning environments.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the 
requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Career Technical Education Programs (School Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
As an independent study charter school, it is challe
nging to offer CTE programs in our schools and our CTE program is still 
under development. In 2018
-
19, we partnered with Brighton College, a private, online CTE college to offer 11 career 
pathways with certification exams at the end of the pathway. Additio
nally, we have IEM written courses in child 
development and fashion design. Further, we work with 7 additional online curriculum vendors to offer CTE courses (not 
a full pathway). These vendors are: Accelerate, APEX, K12, Advanced Academics (Connections), 
Silicon Valley High and 
Schmoop.  Finally, we offer a wide variety of career exploration (pre
-
CTE) courses through eDynamic Learning. These 
courses have been very popular with our students. Finally, we are working with our local community colleges to compl
ete 
pathways begun at the high school level.
 
 
In 2018
-
19, working with UCCI, we created an integrated class: Fashion Forward World History. This is an honors course 
that integrated fashion design with world history.  Our Brighton College and other 
online courses support academic 
learning as many pathways have math and science components. All have reading and writing components. In the case of 
Brighton, students are paired with a learning success coach who identifies academic issues and helps to crea
te an academic 
success plan for each individual student. Edynamic Learning also has academic courses within their pathways including 
English and science classes. Additionally, we are working on CTE graduation pathways for students who want to focus on 
CTE 
certification as part of their graduation process.
 
 
Some of our most popular courses are with eDynamic Learning. These courses are generally 1 semester in length and the 
introductory courses introduce the student to a specific career. We presently offer co
urses that introduce 14 career 
clusters and 64 separate careers. When a student is interested, they may, in many cases, continue their study on a career 
pathway through Brighton, eDynamic Learning or one of our other online vendors. Students of all abiliti
es have proven 
success with our eDynamic courses.

In our independent study charter school, we offer a broad variety of courses, each with their own set of measurable 
outcomes.  In general, we evaluate the program and class effectiveness by reviewing:  the
 
course student learning surveys, 
CAASPP results, and parent and student satisfaction surveys (we review the needs of our students via a student and parent 
survey annually at a minimum.)  We also calculate the number of students passing certification exams
 
once they finish 
their course or course pathway. Our CTE program is still under development and we do not yet have a CTE advisory 
committee.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At South Sutter Charter
 
School, parents are involved in the daily learning of their children. Parental involvement is strong 
in our model of education. Additionally, SSCS parents receive regular emails from a parent listserv group that provides 
information on available resources
, trainings, opportunities, etc. Parents and credentialed teachers work together to 
select vendors who will provide academic support and supplemental hands
-
on learning opportunities including but not 
limited to small group tutoring or classes, music, art, 
PE, and core subject classes. Parents participate with the credentialed 

credentialed teacher at least once every 20 school days to revi
ew and document attendance and the student learning that 
occurs during that learning period.
 
 
All parents have the opportunity to be on our Parent Council or to attend the meetings.  SSCS Parent Council members 
are elected for a two
-
year term and meet via 
teleconference a minimum of twice per year. The function of the Parent 
Council is to two
-

-
based independent 
study experiences and concerns, as well as suggestions and ideas fo

programs; and to uphold the mission of the school and contribute to the success of the school.
 
 
In addition, the school has a Governing Board consisting of five members of the Parent Council which were 
appointed by 
IEM and approved by the Parent Council. All vacant seats on the Governing Board are filled by Parent Council members 
appointed by IEM and serve until permanent members are approved by the Parent Council. The function of the Governing 
Board is 
to review and approve all policies or other matters that require Governing Board approval, or any other matter 
as directed or requested by IEM. The term of office for Governing Board members is one year pursuant to bylaws 
consistent with the charter.
 
 
For 
Special Education students, there is ongoing parental collaboration and support provided to the parent to ensure that 
their student's needs are met as part of the Individualized Education Program. Parents of EL students have access to an EL 
Coordinator and
 
are able to provide input into decisions related to English language acquisition.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan was completed by March 1, 2019, as 
required by law. It can be found on our website at:
 
https://sscs.cc/ss
-
about/ss
-
schooldocuments/ss
-
schoolpolicyinfo#safety
 
 
The safety plan was last reviewed in December 2019 and no updates were needed. As a non
-
site based charter school 
with no 
school
-
owned buildings that students attend, the school safety plan was completed appropriately for our setting. 
The safety plan is primarily composed of school policies which the school already had in place to ensure student safety. 
Community resources an
d general emergency disaster procedures are included in the safety plan.

Every year starts out with a day long training that occurs before the start of the school year. All certificated staff must 
attend this training where the 

is discussed.
 
 
In 2017
-
2018, Education Specialists (ESs) attended required monthly professional development meetings with other ESs 
in their geographical area. Each m
eeting had a set agenda that informs the ESs of important duties, procedures, and 
trainings. The agenda also allowed for networking time amongst the group on a variety of topics and procedures. 
Additionally, each ES completed monthly professional developme
nt hours on a topic of their choice that relates to their 
annual goals. These were reported upon at the monthly meetings. Educator Effectiveness Funding was used to provide 
professional development conferences to certificated staff based on their employee 
goals for the year.
 
 
In 2018
-
2019 ESs attended four partial
-
day in
-
person professional development trainings presented on a variety of 
relevant topics from each academic department pertaining to the identified school
-
wide area of focus.  
Additionally, they 
attended three partial
-
day online professional development trainings with the same cohort of teachers.  These seven 
cohort meetings allow the school and ESs to receive timely and relevant training in areas of need as they arise throughou
t 
the year. Additionally, staff attended monthly online staff meetings where they discuss important duties, procedures, and 
trainings. Title II Funding was used to provide professional development conferences to certificated staff based on their 
employee g
oals for the year.
 
 
In 2019
-
2020 ESs will attend three in
-
person cohort meetings and five online staff meetings. Each of these times has been 
lengthened from the previous year and they are spread out so that one professional development training occurs eac
h 
month of the school year. This allows ongoing and timely support and training to our educational staff. Additionally, each 
educator is required to fulfill 17 hours of personalized professional development training based on their employee goals 
for the ye
ar.
 
 
The primary areas of focus for professional development are selected annually after reviewing several sources of data 
collected focusing on student achievement including CAASPP test results and i
-
Ready testing results.   Based on survey 
data, the 2017
-
18 professional development focused on the implementation of a Writing Initiative.  Additionally, in 2018, 
an Academic Support Survey was completed by ESs to gather information about the needs of our students and resulted in 
the implementation of the Math
 
Initiative for 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20.  Both the Writing Initiative and the Math Initiative 
had a professional development focus on curriculum, instructional strategies, and intervention strategies to improve 
student performance in those content areas.
 
 
New 
Educational Specialists (ESs) are guided through a year long training process that covers all aspects of their job as 
personalized learning independent study teachers. They also observe a learning record meeting of a veteran ES. An advisor 
is assigned to e
ach Educational Specialist to interact with them as a mentor and supervisor. The advisor explains the 
procedures and requirements in further detail, oversees their paperwork, and ensures that they are following set policies 
and procedures correctly.
 
 
Speci
al Education teachers engage in monthly department training opportunities with a wide variety of topics ranging 
from specific types of strategies for specific disabilities to training on legal issues to ensure compliance with federal and
 
state laws. Specia
