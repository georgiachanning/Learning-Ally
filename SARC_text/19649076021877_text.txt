Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisf
y the requirements for entrance to

The School Site Council, which is comprised of parents and staff members, helps to develop our 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement through the school planning process. Our categorical programs parent advisory groups (ELAC and SAC) meet 
regularly. Kingsley 
has parent representatives for the District Advisory Council, Parent Leads, and District English Learner 
Advisory Committee. Our Kingsley PTA actively seeks to encourage volunteers to participate in the many school wide 
events and to help with various need
s on campus and in classrooms. Kingsley Elementary continues to offer monthly 
parent training called Parent University. It is a time for parents to engage with school employees and community and 
district organizations to learn about pertinent topics such a
s CCSS math instruction, mental health and technology. Parents 
earn varying "degrees" based on the number of sessions they attend. This year, Kingsley continues to be focused on 
building community connections through parent and family events such as Loteri
a Night, the Holiday Concert and many 
other events. Parents, students and the community participate in various ways for which they are informed via our Parent 
InTouch Phone system, flyers, the REMIND text system, our school website and a monthly school cal
endar.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the 
Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the district 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. A disaster preparedness plan is in 
place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. The plan also identifi
es a Crisis Team as well as a plan for finding a lost 
child on campus. All buildings within the district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy 
may be found at each school that seeks to insure a safe and orderly environment 
for students and staff. A Safe School Plan 
has been adopted, and it includes policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components of a safe and 
orderly school environment, suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, child abuse reporting proc
edures, student dress 
codes, and student and staff sexual harassment.
