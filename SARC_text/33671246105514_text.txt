About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Re
port Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountab
ility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SAR
C.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the 
CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

and needs.
 
 
Honey Hollow Elementary S

a Volunteer Orientation with administration to provide expectations, guidance, and identify areas where they can support comm
unity
 
groups (PTA, ELAC, 
AAPAC), school initiatives, and activities for student enrichment and development.  Community volunteers such as adults from 
the business community 
and students from high schools and local universities provide support for tutorial progr
ams.
