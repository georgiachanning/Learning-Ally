About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availabi
lity of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materia
ls pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and 
to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
accordin
g to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the scho
ol. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
de
termine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public mee
ting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Norwood Creek Elementary School, originally constructed in 1981, is 
currently comprised of 36 permanent and portable classrooms, a conference area, 
the main office, a library, a cafeteria, a staff lounge, a play structure, a recreational lawn area, and one playground, in a
ddition to the kindergarten play 
area. The office/m
ulti
-
use building renovation was completed in February of 2012. The multi
-
use building contains a new stage and sound and projection 
system. The chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Norwood Creek Elementar
y School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted cleaning standar
ds 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emp
has
is on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional lea
rning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

 
heavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods.
 
 
Additionally, a schedule
d maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair
. A 
work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given the highest priori
ty
; repair requests are 
completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with
 
expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 200
9, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. Th
e district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repair.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
