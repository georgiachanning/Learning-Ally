Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Bangor Union Elementary School District held a public hearing in September 2019, and determined that the school has 
sufficient standards
-
aligned textbooks, instructional materials and science
-
lab equipment pursuan
t to the settlement of 
Williams, et al., v. State of California, et al. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual sta
ndards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and 
to take home. Although 
the state textbook
-

purchased a new middle
-
school algebra and math series and new elementary K
-
4 reading materials. In addition, in 2016,
 
Bangor purchased new math textbooks for grades K
-
2 and new English language arts textbooks for grades 5
-
8. In 2013, 
Bangor purchased new math textbooks for grades 3
-
6. These new textbooks aide in the transition to the Common Core 
State Standards (CCSS). M
aterials approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is 
made to the school board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials 
are available for parent examination at the dis
trict office prior to adoption.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Bangor Elementary School 
greatly benefits from supportive parents who work on projects of the Bangor Parent Association 
and would like to encourage more parents to get involved. The school has a number of parent volunteers who provide 
assistance to teachers and financial support t
o the school and its programs. Parents are also welcome to join the School 
Site Council/ LCAP Committee, Bangor Parents Association and other community partnerships. With the advent of the 
Local Control Funding Formula and the Local Control Accountability 
Plan, there is a greater need and opportunity for 
parent input and participation.

Staff members are building teaching skills and concepts by participating in many conferences and workshops throughout 
the year and then share their experiences and knowledge with district 
colleagues. BUESD had an early
-
release
-
day concept 
where school is dismissed an hour earlier each Friday for teachers to participate in professional growth and staff 
collaboration, which has proven most effective. Teachers are provided three buyback days p
er year to participate in 
professional growth and development.
 
 
In the 2018
-
19 year, professional development has been focused on the implementation of PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support) and other strategies for improving school culture, as 
well as a focus on Reading. BUESD has 
contracted with the Butte County Office of Education and is tapping into their technology and professional resources.
 
 
The administration and certificated teaching staff have been involved in a collaborative process wi
th other single school 
districts. Bangor has been collaborating with Manzanita, Golden Feather, and Pioneer School Districts. These districts have 
similar populations, similar staff makeups/configurations and are experiencing the same challenges that come 
with being 
a small and single school district. These collaborative efforts have been in researching best practices of instruction and 
systems that lead to a positive school climate with an emphasis on student behavior.  We will continue with this 
collabora
tive effort with the County Office and other school staffs to ensure we are providing the best opportunity for our 
students to achieve at high levels.
