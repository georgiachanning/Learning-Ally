By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Westwood Elementary School is located in the Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD). It was established in 1957.
 
 
 
Throughout the years, Westwood has grown into a total of eighteen (18) self
-
co
ntained classrooms. twelve (12) 
classrooms which support a learning environment of 27:1 ratio (grades K
-
3) and six (6) classrooms which support a learning 
environment of 30:1 ratio (grades 4
-
5). In addition to the self
-
contained classrooms, Westwood houses
 
six (6) pre/K Autism 
classrooms and one (1) Kindergarten/First Autism classroom. Also housed on campus are an EIBI Center, an OT 
(Occupational Therapy) Center, a PIP (Primary Intervention Program) room, a Counseling room, and a Resource room. In 
addition,
 
there is a speech therapy room, a multi
-
purpose auditorium, a library, an onsite extended daycare program, and 
two computer labs. Westwood serves students from preschool through fifth grade.
 
 
The median income of the families at Westwood ranges from low i
ncome to middle income. There is a large percentage 
of single parent families, working mothers, and/or two working parents. Many of the parents work within, or slightly 
outside of Silicon Valley. To meet the needs of these working families, Westwood offers
 
an extended day program.
 
 
One unique feature of Westwood is its native forest. This forest consists of native Californian trees and shrubs that were 
planted by parents in 1961. The forest is mostly still thriving today.
 
 
Westwood's population is of divers
e cultures and ethnicities. As such, staff have had the opportunity to create a positive 
and safe environment for students of all cultures, ethnicities, and academic abilities. The mainstream enrollment consists 
of economically, ethnically, socially, and a
cademically diverse students. We consider this to be a strength, as our students 
have enjoyed a living microcosm of positive intercultural relationships. Having a student population that collectively 
speaks 26 different languages shapes our instructional p
rogram. The two dominant languages spoken by our children are 
English and Spanish. At the time of this report, 25% of our students qualified for ELD services, 30 students are receiving 
Special Education services, 5 students are supported on by a 504 plan i
n grades K
-
5 and 40% of our students receive free 
or reduced priced meals.
 
 
Members of the Westwood staff consist of approximately thirty
-
six certificated teachers including classroom teachers, the 
Autism classroom teachers, two full
-
time Resource 
Specialists, a 25% reading teacher, a Wellness Coordinator, a 40% 
Speech Language Specialist, one 20% school counselor, a 40% Primary Intervention Program (PIP), and a 40% school 
psychologist. The K
-
5 teaching staff is supported by two Resource Paraeducato
rs, one physical education instructor 
(grades 3
-
 
5), a school secretary, an attendance clerk, a 5 hour/week health assistant, two and a half custodians, a library 
media assistant, two food service persons, numerous playground supervision persons and mainte
nance personnel. All 
regular education classroom teachers are CLAD certified (Cultural Language Acquisition Development).
 
 
Westwood has a very active PTA (Parent Teacher Association) and School Site Council (SSC), which provide financial 
assistance and lea
dership to the school programs. Westwood PTA host various fundraisers including an annual Fall Festival, 
Red Ribbon Week, Stories Under the Stars, SCRIP and eScrip programs. In addition, parents run the book fairs, help with 
yard duty, volunteer in our gar
dens plots and plan activities for teacher appreciation week. Many also volunteer for 
numerous needs throughout the school year as needed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes great eff
orts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 

 
department at (408) 423
-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to devel
op cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school building comp
onents. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort to spe
nd taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in updated
 
technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambitious ro
of 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and security 
systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews campus
, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging play 
structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
Westwood was originally built in 1954. Portables were added in 1997 and 20
01. In 2002, two wings were demolished and 
rebuilt, and the remainder of the school was modernized. There are 38 classrooms, a library, a multi
-
purpose room and 
an administration building.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals and action
s to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a sa
fe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills and attitudes
 
including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the School Site Cou
ncil in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, 
and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development opportunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for S
tudent Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students 
by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practices, cognitive development and learning disabilities, an
d best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, and instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicat
ed to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 school 
year, and eight days of professional development in t
he 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while assessing student work.
