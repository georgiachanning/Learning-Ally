School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Paul Ecke 
Central Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff and volunteers. The school 
received site upgrades as part of the Capital Facilites and Technology Plan during the summer of 2015 that included solar 
tubes, solar panels, new w
indows, carpet and flooring, classroom furniture.  During the Summer of 2016, in partnership 
with the City of Encinitas, Paul Ecke Central's Vulcan Avenue student drop off and pick up areas were remodeled to ensure 
student safety.  On the playground and co
mmon areas, wooden benches and fencing were replaced with more durable 
synthetic ones. The entire school was repainted in 2010. The restrooms were also refurbished. In 2009
-
10 the Media 
Center was remodeled to include new furniture, carpeting, and a media 
information desk. During the 2010
-
11 school year, 
the kindergarten play structure and main playground structures were updated with new equipment. A running track was 
installed during the 2011
-
12 school year and a section of the track was upgraded in the Su
mmer of 2016.  The asphalt was 
resurfaced in October 2018.  New play structure, electronic marquee, and a storage barn were also installed in December 
2018.  The coating on the asphalt was performed in 2019
