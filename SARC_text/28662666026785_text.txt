Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The main buildings were constructed in the early 

-
use building and drinking 
fountain were constructed with funds from Measure G. Several years ago upgrading in the technology wifi system was 
completed. With the participation of the Kiwanis Club and Browns Valley 
Family Club, three playground structures have 
been built in 2000 and 2011.  Each classroom has ample technology for student access. Two computer labs each include 
35 work stations.  A library building and connected computer lab was purchased by the BVFC in
 
1997 to ensure the school 
would always have a library and working computer lab for students.

students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A school
-
wide focus on safety, health and well being has resulted in a campus that is virtually free of violence, drugs, and 
crime.  Grounds are kept litter
-
free and supervised by a 
full
-
time day custodian and two evening custodians. Inspections 
by the Napa Fire Department address code compliance and assure that facilities are safe for students and staff.  We use 
BEST practices to support our safe learning environment.   Our Comprehen
sive School Safety Plan addresses all 
components of SB187, including biannual Crime Reports, Student Discipline, Sexual Harassment, Dealing with Dangerous 
Pupils, Crisis Response Plan, Dress Code, and Alternative Programs.  The plan is reviewed annually by
 
the Site Safety 
Committee that includes staff, parents, and representatives of law enforcement.  Emergency packs have been supplied 
for each classroom which includes food, water, and first aid supplies. Evacuation drills are held monthly.  School rules ar
e 
published in August.  During the first weeks of school, teachers and the principal explain policies about student safety, 
playground, rules, classroom behavior, bullying, and harassment.  Our comprehensive Student Management System 
follows the NVUSD Boar
d Policy and Administrative Regulations interventions, corrective measures and actions and 
school
-
based consequences.  Students are respected, supported and thrive under these conditions of a highly effective 
and safe school climate and culture.

Teachers meet weekly in Professional Learning Communities to share "Best Practices" so classroom instruction is optimal.  
Assessment data is reviewed on a regular basis so instruction is targeting what 
students need to learn.  Staff meeting 
topics often include professional development in core areas and student behavior management.  Teachers attend district 
and professional development workshops when appropriate.  Our staff embraces "life
-
long learning."
