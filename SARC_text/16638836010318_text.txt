By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Accountability Report Card. The purpose of the School 

achievement, materials and facilities, and the staff.
 
 
 
R.J. Neutra School is surro
unded by endless acres of field crops and military operations on the Lemoore Naval Air Station. 
Many are amazed that the school was designed in 1929 and built in 1960 because of its modern look and appeal. R.J. 
Neutra School strives to provide a warm and s

is to foster intellectual, emotional, social, ethical, and physical health.
 
 
 
It is the belief of R.J. Neutra School that students can and will excel in an environment that is t
ailored to their evolving 
needs and conducive to all facets of the learning process. It is due to this belief that we have been able to successfully 
develop a comprehensive educational system that celebrates and promotes ethnic and cultural diversity, indi
viduality, 
and emotional, intellectual, and social eminence.
 
 
 
At R.J. Neutra School, we have made a commitment to provide the best educational program possible for our students. 
The excellent quality of our program is a reflection of our highly committed 
staff.
 
 
 
We renew our commitment yearly in hopes that together, we will continue to improve our effectiveness in edifying 
students of today, preparing them to become productive citizens of tomorrow. It is in light of this fact, that we welcome 
any suggesti
ons, ideas, or comments you may have. Parents can contact us at 559
-
998
-
6823 or through our home page 
address: www.central.k12.ca.us/neutra.
 
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
The R.J. Neutra staff, in partnership with parents, will work toward effectively preparing our
 
children to live in the world 
as it will exist in the future. We believe that much of the work our children will do in the twenty
-
first century is not yet 
determined. We strive, therefore, to prepare children to be lifelong learners, to think critically, 
to be problem solvers, and 
to learn from past experiences.
 
 
The staff and parents envision R.J. Neutra School as a place of growth for the total child: intellectual, emotional, social, 
ethical, and physical. Our school is where individual needs are 
recognized so that every student may experience success 
within an atmosphere of warmth, mutual respect, and caring. We monitor, adjust, and thus increase student 
achievement.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The 
Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Neutra School in collaboration with local agencies and 
District administration to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting 
procedures, teacher notifi
cation of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival 
and department from school, sexual harassment policy, dress code policy, and bully prevention policy.  The most current 
school site safety plan is reviewed annu
ally and any changes or modifications are presented to the School Board by March 
1.  Annually, the plan is also reviewed,  discussed, and shared with school staff in the fall at a staff meeting. Components 
of the School Site Safety Plan are discussed at mo
nthly staff meetings throughout the school year.
 
 
 
The student handbook outlines school policies and procedures concerning emergency situations, school bus safety, 
playground behavior, first aid, illness, health issues, and special services. 
Lockdown and Evacuation Drills are conducted 
once a month, and Drop and Cover drills are done in the fall each year.  All visitors are required to check in at the school 
office upon arrival and departure.
 
 
 
As students arrive on campus in the morning, inst
ructional aides supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria 
while breakfast is served. Instructional aides supervise playground activities during recess. Lunchtime activities are 
supervised by instructional aides in the cafeteria and on the p
layground. At the end of the day, teachers supervise students 
to ensure a safe and orderly departure. R.J. Neutra School provides two
-
way radios to those who are supervising students 
to maintain open, continuous communication.

Central Union School District combines efforts to provide training and curriculum development based on the California 
Standards which are aligned to the content of the curriculum frameworks for grades kindergarten through eight. Teachers 
within the Distric
t align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed state proficiency levels. 
 
 



to focus on the Professional Learning Communities (PLC). Grade Level Teams have worked to identify Essential Standards 
Districtwide to ensure that all students are achie
ving. The District continues to partner with Solution Tree to support our 
learning community process through training and coaching for our educators. 
 
 
A Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) Leadership Team was developed during the 2017
-
18 school year, an
d continues 
to be instrumental presently. This group began with a focus on the Social
-
Emotional and Behavioral needs of students. 
Based on their findings, they provided training on Connectedness to administrators and staff. An ongoing needs 
assessment was 
conducted at each site to provide information for next steps. Over time, we can expect to see continued 
improvement in school culture as well as student achievement as a result of this research
-
based practice. 
 
 
Central partners with local County Offices o
f Education and content experts to provide staff training and coaching to 
support the full implementation and sustainability of State Standards. This year, they included:
 

 
Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
 

 
21st Century Teaching & Learning 
Capacity Building
 

 
English Language Development
 
Just as teachers differentiate for their students, the District strives to differentiate learning for staff. To that end, it 
hosts 
several optional trainings each year as well as providing opportunities for st
aff to attend trainings outside the District. 
Teachers chose to attend those that best meet their needs for personal professional growth. Optional Trainings for 2017
-
18 focused on Student Engagement through the use of Collaboration and Cooperative Strategi
es in the classroom. 
 
 
Instructional aides receive training in instructional strategies to assist students with reading skills improvement, First Ai
d/ 
CPR, English Learners, Technology and Reading Mastery. Classified staff acquire job
-
related training thro
ugh in

Newly credentialed and/or beginning teachers receive training on assessment, individualized support, integration of 
instructional technology, and advanced content from the California Teacher Induction Program which is the preferred 
pathway to a California 
Professional (Clear) Teaching Credential. The Teacher Induction Program is co
-
administered by the 
California Department of Education (CDE) and the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). The Teacher 
Induction Task Force and State Leadership 
Team provide support and technical assistance to local Teacher Induction 
Program leaders. The Teacher Induction program provides standards
-
based, individualized advice and assistance that 
combines the application of theory learned in the preliminary teache
r preparation program with mentor
-
based support 
and formative assessment feedback. 
 
 
Sites also differentiate for staff based on the needs of their site, providing training through Staff Meetings, Instructional
 
Aides Meetings and additional site profession
al development including such topics as:
 

 
Math Model & Coaching
 

 
English Language Development
 

 
Collaboration
 
Professional Development specific to Neutra included advancing student technology use and further implementing digital 
portfolios. Learning about and 
creating school
-
wide behavior expectations and as well as overall school safety in the event 
of an emergency. Also learning more about 21st Century Libraries, Makerspace, and flexible seating benefits in the 
classrooms.
 
 
As we plan for the future of our Di
strict, continuing to build our capacity in the PLC Process so we can ensure all students 

-
emotional and behavioral will continue 
to be a primary focus.
