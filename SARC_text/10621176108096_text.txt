Valley Oak Elementary is a school with a tradition of excellence and a staff committed to high 
academic standards. The faculty is dedicated to meeting the learning needs of all students. Serving 
as a learning community, the parents and local businesses are
 
involved and supportive of the 
educational processes at Valley Oak. The community takes pride in the fact that Valley Oak was 
twice recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School in 1994 and 2001 and has earned California State 
Distinguished School awards in
 
1993, 2000, 2004 and 2008. Valley Oak has been honored by the 
California Business for Educational Excellence (CBEE) as one of the 187 Scholar Schools in California 
for 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015.
 
 


to all our students, not only in academics, but also with regard to their social and emotional health. 
Although Valley Oak is known for academic excellence, we also strive to be leaders and model a
 
giving spirit. Parent Club, student council, individual staff and students lead by example through 
annual events such as Kids Day and Caps for Kids for Pediatric Cancer Patients. The partnership 
between the staff and families of Valley Oak make this schoo
l second to none in Clovis Unified! 


school of approximat
ely 500 students, has a small
-
school feel, yet offers amazing programs for 
students across all grade levels.
 
 
Wildcat excellence is evidenced by the numerous academic awards, science fair recipients, co
-
curricular honors, athletic championships, amazing vi
sual and performing arts programs, and by 
the outwardly focused spirit our students exemplify every day. Valley Oak continues to encourage 
a balanced approach to learning with a focus on rigorous curriculum, inquiry
-
based learning, the 
arts, science in the
 
Outdoor Learning Center (garden) and technology. Wildcat pride has continued 
through the decades and has evolved into a focused community of adults and children with the 
unwavering dedication of the Valley Oak staff.
 
 
As we enter the 2019
-
2020 school year
, we reviewed our data from the Smarter Balanced 
Assessment Consortium (SBAC) standardized testing. We are proud of our students in their growth 
overall on these assessments. Our school achieved a proficiency level much higher than the state 
average in bot
h Mathematics and English Language Arts. Having a long
-
standing history of high 
achievement, our expectation is that our students will show that again this year.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Valley Oak was built in 1989. We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our custodians perform basic cleaning operations
 
daily and maintain the 
grounds and buildings. Three custodians are assigned
 
to Valley Oak. One custodian works from morning to late afternoon, a second custodian works 
from afternoon to night and a third custodian works from afternoon to evening. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted two ti
mes a year at each site. 
100 percent o
f our toilets are in working condition, and if there is a problem, our custodians promptly fix them. Our School Assessment Re
view Team 
(SART) committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds
 
and restrooms on a 
regular basis to provide feedback to our student body. Additionally, classrooms are assigned specific areas on campus to keep
 
clean and take ownership 

e. The plant supervisor also inspects the campus daily for safety 
issues.
 
 

i is removed immediately. 
Through increased community aw
areness, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low. The custodial 
staff is on campus until 11:30 p.m. each evening, which also helps to deter such behavior.
 
 
Valley Oak has a large, grassy playground with tw
o baseball diamonds and one softball diamond. Fields are used for additional softball fields, track and 
field, football field, and three soccer fields. Students also have a large blacktop play area with 10 basketball hoops, two v
olleyball nets and several 
tetherball sets. There is also playground equipment available that meets safety standards.
 
 
The Valley Oak Library Media Center has six electronic stations for students to search for books, go online or use various co
mputer programs. Accelerated 
Reader is 
fully operational school wide. The library has approximately 10,000 books in its collection. The Technology Center has 40 lap
tops, purchased 
by our parent club. Each classroom in grades 3
-
6 have 1:1 student to device ratio. Additionally, we have a fully st
ocked computer cart to supplement the 
technology needs of our K
-
2 classrooms. Continuing to purchase technology is on the forefront of our budgetary needs.
 
 
The district believes that schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority
 
is placed on building and maintaining excellent facilities 
as economically as possible.
 
 
In June 2012, voters within the CUSD approved Measure A, a bond measure of $298 million. Projects completed at Valley Oak inc
luded the following: a 
Library Media Cent
er remodel, upgrade to the HVAC system, technology updates, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance and other site 
improvements. Modernization and renovation projects were completed in November 2014. Another bond measure is being put before
 
the vo
ters March 
2020, primarily for the expected growth of our district.
 
 
All teachers and support staff are provided with their own classroom or office. With the passage of the pre
-
vious bond measure, the following 
modernization projects were completed. These projects have provided even more exemplary facilities for our student
s, staff and community:
 

 
New Library Media Center
 

 

 

 
New parking lot
 

 
New playground equipment
 

 
New storage units in the four existing portables
 

 
Modified administration office
 

 
New technology classroom
 
 
During the summer and fall of 
2014, the most extensive modernization took place on the Valley Oak campus.
 
 
Upgrades included:
 

 
Security
-
camera installation
 

 
New HVAC system
 

 
Remodel of the Library Media Center
 

 
Installation of new carpet for the remainder of the campus
 

 
Remodeled 
student restrooms
 

 
Upgraded network capabilities
 

 
Upgraded fire
-
alarm system
 

 
New flooring, lighting and sound system in the multipurpose room
 
 
During the summer of 2016, new drought
-
tolerant landscape was installed in the interior of campus. This included se
veral new trees that replaced those 
that were lost because of the drought. This additional land
-
scaping has brought new life to our already beautiful school environment.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a 
score or not; however, the number of students tested is 
not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated
 
using only students who received scores.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
School Safety
 
 
Supervision is provided before and after school with campus monitors and administration supervising students during lunch. Al
l visitors and volunteers 
are required to 
check in at the office and wear an identification badge. This year we have implemented a new visitor and volunteer check in s
ystem called 
Raptor. This system adds another layer of safety for our campus. Staff, parents and community members review and updat
e the school safety plan 
annually. It is currently in the process of the annual update. Valley Oak is committed to maintaining a safe school environme
nt. On the 2019 parent 
survey, 97 percent of the parents and guardians rated school safety as superior. Mo
nthly safety drills are practiced with the students to ensure their 
understanding of all emergency procedures. These include lock down, school alert, evacuation, fire drill, power outage and ea
rthquake procedures. Key 
elements of the plan include monthly s
afety drills and crisis
-
intervention plans.

Valley Oak keeps abreast of new teaching strategies and technology with release time for a variet
y of conferences, grade
-
level meetings and in
-
service 
experiences. Early student dismissal on Wednesdays also provides teachers an additional 90 minutes each week to collaborate a
nd articulate with other 
grade
-
level teachers in professional learning commun
ities.
 
 
The administration fully supports all staff development with fiscal and personnel resources and personal participation. Staff
 
training is consistent with 
the school goals for curriculum, instruction and assessment for improved student achievement. 
The curriculum and instruction department offers 
additional trainings and in
-
services throughout the year.
 
 

ent professional 
develo
pment has centered around early childhood trauma and its effects on the brain. Valley Oak is in the initial stages of becomin
g a trauma informed 
school.
 
 
Valley Oak has also received training in Kagan Cooperative Learning Strategies in grades 1
-
6. These st
rategies taught to the students increase the level of 
engagement of all students regardless of ability. Teach
-
ers have reported that students are more engaged and are working closely with students they 
might not normally have worked with.
 
 
Through the Loca
l Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) funding, a teacher on special assignment works with our staff in the area of technology 
and comes 
on site to work with students and teachers to utilize the many technologies available to them. Our Clovis West area has a
lso hired a transition counselor 
and learning director to assist students in the transition from elementary to middle school. Each school has a dedicated pers
on who works two days a 
week

or more as needed

with our students who do not have a support system 
at home, mentoring them to be on the path to college. These individuals 
work with the students in goal setting and building a trusting relationship with another adult on campus who cares about thei
r progress and emotional 
well
-
being.
 
 
The district focused 
all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understandin
g. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A 
variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program. 
 
In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant inst
ructional practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III

ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
Scho
ol Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re
-
K 
-

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
 
 
Categorical Program Descriptions

educational and recreational 
opportunities for students within the learning community while providing a safe environment for students. The goals of this p
rogram are to: 1) improve 
academic achievement, and 2) provide enrichment opportunities that reinforce
 
and complement the academic program.
