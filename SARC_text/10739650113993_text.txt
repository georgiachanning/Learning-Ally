About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Educat
ion. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the c
ase of c
lass sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitment of the
 
district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All 
instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials that 
are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the ma
terials. The Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Educational Services.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Harvest sits on 20 acres and 53,000 
square feet. It contains 36 classrooms at 34,227 sq ft, and 16 restrooms at 3,193 sq ft. The oldest main building was 
built in 2007. The table below shows the results of the school's most recent inspection using the Facility Inspection Tool (F
IT).  This in
spection determines 
the school facility's good repair status. District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school in goo
d repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner.  For all items inspected that were found to not be i
n 'good repair', work orders have been created and maintenance will 
be done before the end of the 2019
-
2020 school year.  Maintenance items will be prioritized so that student safety is not compromised.  The overall 
rating for this school is 'fair'.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

lifornia Administrative 
Code, which requires all public 
schools, kindergarten through community college, to have written emergency response plans. The plan is devoted to the 
safety and welfare of the students of Harvest Elementary during all school hours. The major objectives of the emergency respo
nse procedure
s are to 
save lives and protect property in the event of an emergency or another disaster. Harvest has emergency plans for different s
cenarios from dealing with 
bloodborne pathogens, bomb threats to complete school
-
wide evacuations as well as how to approp
riately clean classrooms.   Students and staff 
participate in drills that are performed monthly for fire and earthquake and lockdown drills are practiced quarterly.  Staff 
also have a yearly training on 
Run, Hide and Fight (currently scheduled for 4/29/20)
 
with the Fresno County Sheriff's Department and all classrooms are equipped with a walkie
-
talkie 
for communication.  Staff participates in training on the Site Emergency Response Plan throughout the year at professional de
velopment meetings and 
quarterly 
safety walks are done on campus.  The staff was trained on the School Safety Plan on 8/13/19, 8/14/19, and 8/21/19.  It was d
istributed to staff 
on 8/21/19 electronically and School Site Council approved it on 9/17/19.  Surveillance cameras are installed t
o assist in monitoring the campus.

Harvest 
Elementary has a staff development program that consists of weekly early dismissal days for grades TK
-
6. Every other week on a Principal Day, 
every teacher participates in staff development after school in a variety of areas to improve their performance an
d capacity in the classroom. The areas 
of focus selected for staff development comes from student needs identified through analysis of assessment data throughout th
e year, our teacher 
observation data, teacher goals, and evaluations. Our primary focuses th
is year for staff development are in the areas of strengthening teacher 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) by looking at data to determine student needs in English Language Arts, English Lear
ner support, and 
Mathematics.  The staff will focus on incr
easing justification and academic vocabulary for students with writing in all subject areas while at the same time 
incorporating the use of strategies for English Language Learners. Staff members will receive professional development at the
 
school site as 
well as 
attending full
-
day district or county training or conferences that are offered throughout the school year in these identified areas.  Teache
rs also have 
planning days and participate in lesson study for our newly adopted Science curriculum learning
 
how to infuse Language Arts Standards with Science.
 
 
In addition, grade levels meet twice a week in PLC/data teams to discuss current grade level assessment data. After sharing a
nd discussing their strengths 
and strategies, teachers collaborate and plan l
essons for the following week. Our instructional coach has an on
-
going collaboration with teachers to 
follow up and provide support. Harvest teachers utilize the Co
-
Plan, Co
-
teaching Model. Teachers are given additional time with the instructional coach 
fo
r demonstration lessons, peer observations, mini
-
lessons and by providing timely and specific feedback to improve and reflect on their teaching 
strategies. The instructional coach rotates through all teachers' classrooms focusing on targeted areas of need.
 
The Principal and the GIA have weekly 
observations through the classrooms and leave feedback either in writing or in person, or both. Newly hired teachers are also
 
a part of the District's 
Teacher Induction Program and have weekly meetings with their supp
ort provider (mentor teacher) to plan strategies or lessons and debrief as well as 
meet with the Principal monthly for New Teacher PLC. Paraprofessionals in our kinder classes and our Teaching Fellows are tra
ined at the District Office 
yearly and on
-
site m
onthly to stay current on instructional strategies and school policies.  Non
-
instructional support staff have quarterly meetings at the 
District Office and monthly onsite meetings with administration to go over work performance issues, school concerns and 
policies.

Types of Services Funded
 
The programs and supplemental services that are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources are 
as follows:
 
 
English Language Learners: Teachers are using District adopted curriculum; Wonders.  They have been trained on how to use mat
erials for Integrated 
and Designated ELD with District and on
-
site training focusing on ELD strategies to move student
s up from their current EL levels. Teachers have set aside 
a specific time each day to provide English Language Development (ELD) for those students who are identified and measured by 
the English Language 
Proficiency Assessments of California (ELPAC) annua
lly.  Students are identified as current ELs with an ELPAC Initial Assessment and progress monitored 
yearly using the ELPAC Summative Assessment to look for growth as well as the use of the California Assessment of Student Per
formance and Progress 
(CAASPP)
, District Benchmarks, grade level common assessments, and in
-
class performance.
 
 
Special Education Students: Our teachers use the inclusion model at Harvest for students who have individual education plans 
(IEP). This means that the 
Specialized Academic I
nstruction is both a pull
-
out and push
-
in program for mainstreaming students in the general education classroom.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Students are clustered in one classroom per grade level in grades 2
-
6 as identified by GATE criteria and 
assessment 
each year. GATE teachers are part of a 2
-
year GATE Teacher Certificate program with on
-
going support to help them provide enrichment and extension 
activities to challenge our GATE students. A District GATE instructional coach co
-
teaches and prov
ides support to our classroom teachers to increase rigor 
and challenge for our GATE cluster classrooms.  In addition, a district supplemental enrichment GATE teacher provides additio
nal instruction weekly as 
well as an annual field trip.
 
 
At
-
Risk Students 
are identified in the fall before parent conferences in October each year and progress monitored throughout the school year. 
Accelerated 
Reader Star Diagnostic, Acadience, and Fountas and Pinnell are used as screeners to determine additional services that 
may be needed for struggling 
students. Students who are below grade level (strategic 
-
 
up to two years below) are provided additional learning opportunities and re
-
teaching by the 
classroom teacher. First, second, and third grades have Teaching Fellows who
 
push into the classrooms to provide small group support and reading 
intervention for an hour a day four days a week.  Teaching Fellows support our four kinder classes for a half an hour a day t
o work on letter and sound 
recognition and sight words.  A pul
l out program with 30 minutes a day is provided in grades 4th 
-
 
6th, based on their reading level to provide additional 
support to students who are at risk with our Reading Intervention Teacher in 8
-
week cycles. Math intervention is also provided for grade
s 1st through 
6th to work on standards that are not mastered in small groups with the classroom teacher.  Students who need additional supp
ort are recommended 
for after school tutoring which is delivered by a credentialed teacher in each grade level twice 
a week for an hour.  All students are progress monitored 
monthly and data is recorded in Google Drive for communication between the classroom teacher, Teaching Fellows, Reading Inter
vention Teacher,  
Instructional Coach and administration.
