About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Repo
rt Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountabil
ity Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CD
E LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Southern Kern 
Unified School District believes that staff development is an important component in maintaining a positive, enriching learni
ng 

pla
n for Student 
Achievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professio
nal learning 
communities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, 
there are regular meetings by the grade levels to 
work collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members
 
are also encouraged to 
participate in workshops and/or conferences that provide 
them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are 
supported by teacher mentors, teacher
-
principal coaching, and Induction support providers.
