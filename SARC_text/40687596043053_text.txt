Harloe Elementary School is located in Arroyo Grande on the beautiful central coast of California in 
an area known for both agriculture and tourism.  Fields of strawberries, truck crops, and wine 
grapes sit along with grazing land for 
cattle ranching.  The sand dunes of Oceano and Pismo Beach 

Elementary is part of the Lucia Mar Unified School District.  School demographics vary greatly with
in 
the district with some schools having over 85% of students from low
-
income families with 50% 
being English learners to others having less than 25% low SES and 3% EL.  Harloe is quite balanced 
however, with 45% of students from low SES families and about
 
10% English learners.  Hispanics 
make up the largest minority group at 33%. This diversity makes Harloe reflective of our local area 
and that is an asset.  Harloe has an active English Learner Advisory Council and a diversity club, 
which sponsors multi

supplement learning materials. Harloe staff, families and community are often referred to as the 

 
many good causes including Gold Day (Childhood 
Cancer Awareness Day), Pennies for Patients, clothing drives and canned food drives.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planne
d Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1954, Harloe Elementary School is situated on 8.9 acres. The school buildings span 41,911 square feet and consist of
 
30 classrooms, a well
-
equipped library, a 36
-
workstation computer lab, a multi
-
use cafeteria, an
d an office complex with areas for the nurse, staff workroom, lounge, and 
administrative staff.  The facility supports teaching and learning through its classroom and playground space.
 
 
Improvement projects recently completed at the school include a new co
vered walkway and roof.  Seven new classrooms and a restroom building were 
constructed in early 2019 to replace classrooms currently housed in portables. Construction of an additional 8 rooms plus ano
ther bathroom complex 
will start in early 2020.
 
 
Harloe 
Elementary School is a closed campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in school ev
ents. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to check
-

sitors are required to return to the school 
office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults supervise students and school grounds, suc
h as the cafeteria and 
recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and cond
uct inspections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are com
pleted in a timely manner. A work
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff
 
has indicated that 100 percent 
of all toilets on school grounds are in working ord
er.
 
 
A team of custodians ensures classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept clean and safe. A scheduled maintenance progr
am is administered 
by the Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained a
nd provide a suitable learning environment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District
 
to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their Safe School Plans: 
current status of 
school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies related to suspensi
on and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress
 
of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are reviewed 
with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. The Injury, Illness & Prevention Plan was last updated and 
reviewed with school staff in 
November 2018.

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing wor
kforce technology and employment environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students grad
uating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessary f
or success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career 
Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, trade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school, college and te
chnical training 
environments. This resulted in the need to dev
elop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engages participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opportunities within a specific industry sector. High Scho
ol Career Pathways provi
de 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario.

Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one industry certification, or equivalent s
kill measurement, to provide 
a competitive
 
advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate and associate d
egree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and in some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while s
till in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Education 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Care
er Technical Education, which was adopted by the State Board of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of career pathway programs of study 
for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway 
preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with industry members and assem
bling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewing and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining o
utreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs. 
 
 
The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway programs, and site administration in the areas of curricu
lum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by attending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally,
 
CTE instructors focus on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affect
s the structural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued
 
to improve annually in the support of current programs that are functioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from programs that currently function as a single co
urse, and establish new 
programs where
 
programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions through the Futu
re Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Art
s, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had regional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Industry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid
, Food Handlers, Serv Safe
, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and som
e pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Additionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique project
s that demonstrate their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are a
ble to gain real world 
experience within their field of study that often times leads to
 
employment.
