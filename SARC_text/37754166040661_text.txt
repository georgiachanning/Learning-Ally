Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Warner has playground supervision before, during, and after sch
ool. All visitors are required to give advanced notice and 
report to the main office to sign
-
in and receive a visitor's badge while on campus. Classroom sizes and resources contribute 
to a positive environment. Comprehensive efforts are made to integrate r
ecycling and environmental concerns into 
facilities as well as curriculum and instruction.
 
 
Warner School was established in 1940. Initially, it consisted of a single building. Today, the school district is unified as
 
an 
elementary, middle and high school.
 
There are a total of 24 classrooms, 20 of which are permanent buildings, and four 
portable buildings. The four portable buildings were constructed in 1996. Warner also has a cafeteria, a multi
-
purpose 
room, and two libraries; one for the high school and o
ne for the elementary school. The high school campus school is 
equipped with a mechanic/wood shop, a science laboratory, and an agriculture facility. Warner Unified School District also 
has a district office.

Across the highway in the community park, ther
e is a community resource center. Custodial, grounds keeping, and 

cafeteria are cleaned daily. The maintenance staff tries to priori
tize school needs as best as possible. A new system of 

which provided state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist scho
ol districts with expenditures for major 
repair or replacement of existing school building components, became inoperative effective July 1, 2013. However, the 
district continues to make an annual contribution to support capital improvement projects, includ
ing deferred 
maintenance projects. For the current 2018
-
19 school year, the district's governing board has not approved deferred 
maintenance projects for the school district but is in the process of taking inventory of deferred maintenance projects and 
upd
ating its plan. When completed, the plan will then be available for review at the district office or on the Internet at 
www.warnerusd.net.
 
 
The Warner Unified School District has contracted with the San Diego County Office of Education (SDCOE) Facilities g
roup 
and with a facilities consultant to assist in prioritizing and implementing a Major Maintenance Plan and a Deferred 
Maintenance Plan. The District has recently replaced two roofs and has repaired an issue with gym flooring. The District 
has supplement
ed the Proposition 39 funding by purchasing all new ballasts and bulbs for all buildings on campus.  The 
Prop 39 implementation took place this year and was used to upgrade HVAC.  Additionally, the District has done a 5
-
year 
maintenance on the Gym and Ag B
uilding roofs.

The District's older inefficient HVAC systems

issues with the design of the septic system 
and leach fields that 
were installed over 50 
years ago.  The district has had the septic 
system near the cafeteria scoped to identify 
issues which are compromising the system.  
The District has upgraded security through a 
camera system over recent years, but could 
use a full sc
ale electronic security system to 
prevent potential theft and vandalism.  
Additionally, the District could use a central 
control for HVAC systems to assist with 
energy waste and high costs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
