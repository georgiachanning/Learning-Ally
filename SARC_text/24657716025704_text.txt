By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary 
concern of Tenaya Middle School. The school is always in compliance with the 
laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student body and
 
staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Assigned staff members monitor the school grounds before, 
during and after school each day. All visitors are required to check in at the 
office before entering the campus. The School 
Safety Plan was implemented in the 1998
-
99 school year and is revised and updated annually in order to ensure that it is 
properly implemented. The plan's policies are reviewed with administrators, staff, and Sc
hool Site Council members. The 
school safety plan was reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty and a student representative on October 30, 
2019.
