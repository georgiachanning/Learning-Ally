By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the schoo
l in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.   A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school's needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, Measure D, and state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Austin Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. 
Village School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as recent replacement of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the other five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, 
cabinetry, heating 
systems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker boards. Each multi
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media centers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administra
tive wing of each school was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs, a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.
 
 
During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure F and local reserves were utilized for 
modernization of the 
Matanzas campus.  Included were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled office complex, and 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction of several classrooms, including a 
shared
 
music building.  In August 2017 the Madrone and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a music room.  A new play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made to the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Villa
ge opened up with a major renovation to the classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, and landscaping improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the schools, with the other schools to be compl
eted in the next two years.  All schools have now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will receive improvements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Board has identified the following as key go
als for the Measure F program. To ensure the 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable classrooms with modular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency components such as HVAC, lighting, and wind
ow systems.
 
 
Cleaning standards have been adopted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance and Operations 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cleaning standards are being upheld. In 
add
ition, the principal communicates daily with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
proactive with maintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under this plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, hea
ting, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
NOTE:  Spring Creek Matanzas Charter School consists of two campuses.  Spring Creek houses students in grades TK 
-
 
3rd.   
Matanzas houses students in grades 4th 
-
 
6th.  The Matanzas facility was found to be Exemplary.  The Spring Creek facility 
scored 98%, placing it in the Good category.  The Exemplary category requires a score of 99% or higher.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population a
nd the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned w
ith alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requir
ements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the Sta

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many 
ways that Spring Creek Matanzas Charter School encourages and provides opportunities for parent 
involvement.  We have an active PTA, which meets monthly. The PTA promotes and enriches the educational experiences 
of the children at Spring Creek Matanzas Cha
rter School by sponsoring many events and activities, including movie nights, 
dances, and BBQs, which reinforce the home and school connection.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to participate on the School Site Council, which meets quarterly. Parents on the council
 
become 
informed, share information, discuss needs and successes, and plan school program improvements. The council assists in 
developing a comprehensive plan designed to improve the effectiveness of the school, and approves the school safety 
plan . All pa
rents are invited to attend the meetings.
 
 
Teachers welcome parent volunteers in the classroom. Other volunteer opportunities exist in the library, science lab and 
garden program, chaperoning on field trips, helping with sports events, and participating in
 
all of our school and PTA
-
sponsored events.  The school honors all volunteers at a Volunteer Tea in the spring.
 
 
The school and district host several committees that encourage and include parent participation.  The English Language 
Advisory Committee and 
the District English Language Advisory Committee  comprises parents of English language 
learners. These committees meet four times a year to discuss the English Language Development Program.  Parents of our 
English learners are invited to be active members
 
of ELAC to ensure that the input of this important parent group and 
community is incorporated into the Spring Creek Matanzas strategic plan and that the needs of all students are met. Adult 

tes, are offered throughout the year to our district parents, 

includes parent members from each school site, and provides opportunities 
for parent input to the Superintendent and 
Governing Board regarding programs and priorities for the District.
 
 
All parents are invited and encouraged to attend Back to School Night and parent conferences.  In addition, we hold several 
events throughout th
e year for the school community such as winter and spring concerts, Welcome Back BBQ, family fun 
nights, and Open House.
 
 
Please contact the school principals for more information on ways to volunteer at school.

School Discipline Practices
 
 
The staff and community of Spr
ing Creek Matanzas Charter School value a school where every student is free to learn and 
play in an environment that is both physically and emotionally safe, supportive, comfortable, and free from outside 
interference and harm. We emphasize the developmen
t of respectful, responsible, and safe behavior. The school 
community works to reinforce and model this behavior. The school rules and discipline procedures are distributed to all 
families each year.
 
 
The following strategies are used to both 
encourage and recognize cooperative and positive behavior both in the 
classroom and on the playground:

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP). With a focus on High 
Quality Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of annual inservice, 
monthly "District Wednesday" workshops on topics of interest/need (8 total), approximately 20 district
-
sponsored after 
school trainings annually, and 2
-
3 planning days
 
throughout the year. A critical component of our professional 
development plan is coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher program.  In addition, professional 
development opportunities are offered through attendance at Sonoma County Office of
 
Education classes and educational 
conferences. For 2017
-
18, our topics of focus are English Language Development, Technology Skills, Common Core ELA 
and Math standards implementation, and an incremental roll out of the Next Generation Science Standards.

-

Austin Creek and Rincon Valley has been focused on improving our math scores for students in grades 3
-
6 as measured 
by the SBAC, and imp
roving English language acquisition for our English learner students as determined by our re
-
designation rates on the former CELDT and current ELPAC tests.
 
 
We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards t
hese goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic growth for our English learners we use the RenLearn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting gr
ade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC and the SBAC to review the effectiveness of 

math progress by reviewing Eureka 
Math end
-
of
-
module assessments, students in grades 1
-
6 also take MobyMax 
placement tests two times per year, and students in grades 3
-
6 take the SBAC summative assessment 1 time per year.
 
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to d
istrict goals and the LCAP. With a focus on High Quality 
Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of professional development trainings, 2
-
3 grade level planning 
days yearly, 8 monthly "District Wednesday" professional development sessio
ns, and approximately 20 district
-
sponsored 
after school trainings.   Teachers can also attend professional development opportunities through Sonoma County Office 

 
 
Teachers are supported in meeting our LC
AP goals with coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher Program, 
teacher
-
principal meetings, and grade level PLC teams.  The support is focused analyzing student assessment data to plan 
curriculum and make instructional choices which support te
acher and student growth.
 
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the district administration and school site principals participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with t
he 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions of Teaching and Leadership.  The administration team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in our
 
classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this professional development to include two 
teachers from each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional
 
development in the framework th
rough CEL.
