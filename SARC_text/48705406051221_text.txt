Description
 
and
 
Mission
 
Statement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Suisun
 
Valley
 
is
 
a
 
rural
 
K-8
 
school
 
of
 
approximately
 
600
 
students
 
located
 
in
 
a
 
prime
 
agricultural
 
area
 
of
 
Suisun
 
Valley.
 
Approximately
 
30%
 
of
 
our
 
students
 
come
 
from
 
outside
 
our
 
attendance
 
area,
 
attending
 
our
 
school
 
as
 
a
 
school-of-open
 
enrollment
 
option.
 
The
 
school
 
has
 
developed
 
a
 
reputation
 
for
 
being
 
a
 
small,
 
nurturing
 
school
 
with
 
an
 
instructionally
 
demanding
 
environment.
 
Its
 
small
 
size
 
promotes
 
frequent
 
communication
 
among
 
staff
 
and
 
parents
 
and
 
close
 
supervision
 
of
 
students,
 
contributing
 
to
 
a
 
small-town-like
 
shared
 
responsibility
 
for
 
students'
 
academic,
 
social,
 
and
 
emotional
 
development.
 
The
 
motto
 
is
 
"We
 
are
 
committed
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
school
 
that
 
gives
 
every
 
student
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
achieve."
 
Suisun
 
Valley
 
is
 
an
 
Agri-Science
 
school
 
where
 
science
 
standards
 
are
 
tied
 
to
 
Agriculture.
 
The
 
school
 
mascot
 
is
 
a
 
dragon,
 
and
 
the
 
school
 
color
 
is
 
red.
 
 
Our
 
Pledge
 
Suisun
 
Valley
 
is
 
committed
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
school
 
that
 
gives
 
every
 
student
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
achieve.
 
Every
 
student
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
be
 
successful.
 
Every
 
student
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
develop
 
their
 
character
 
and
 
academic
 
skills.
 
The
 
education
 
that
 
is
 
provided
 
to
 
students
 
will
 
serve
 
as
 
the
 
foundation
 
that
 
students
 
will
 
build
 
their
 
lives
 
upon.
 
 
Our
 
Goal
 
Every
 
student,
 
without
 
exception
 
and
 
without
 
excuse,
 
will
 
be
 
proficient
 
or
 
advanced
 
in
 
reading,
 
writing,
 
and
 
math.
