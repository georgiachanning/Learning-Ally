By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

create personalized learning plans based on identified student strengths and individual academic needs.  The staff 
continues to work collaboratively to offer rigorous and
 
creative opportunities for our students to prepare them for college 
and career opportunities.  Valley Oaks students know they are valued, can achieve, and are on the path to becoming 
independent and confident teenagers and young adults.  Our students feel
 
engaged and have a high sense of engagement 
while at school, as well as high hope for themselves and their future.

and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are re
viewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Valley Oaks was built in 1966. Throughout the years additional classrooms have been added to address growth and class
-
size reduction. Presently, there are 35 classrooms, a multipurpose room (cafeteri
a, gym, stage), a library, an administration 
building, three playgrounds, and a garden for outdoor science lab classes. Recent modernization to the campus included 
an entire resurfacing of blacktop to all playgrounds. The district takes great effort to ens
ure that Valley Oaks is clean, safe, 
and functional. The table shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection. While reviewing this report, 
please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted
 
in the table have been 
corrected or are in the process of remediation.  Funds from a recently passed general obligation bond are being used to 
help modernize, update, and provide safety improvements for Valley Oaks.  In the summer of 2018 and during the 2
018
-
2019 school year, significant modernization efforts were made to the Kindergarten/1st grade, 2nd grade, and 4th grade 
buildings 
-
 
improvements which include new HVAC units, new roofs, new gutters/drains, new exterior structure repair and 
new paint.  Ad
ditionally, the entire Multi
-
Use room, from Kitchen to gymnasium to stage area have all undergone 
significant modernization efforts, both in the exterior and interior, including new HVAC, fire sprinkler install, new LED 
lighting, new flooring throughout, n
ew walls, doors, ceiling, complete bathroom remodel, complete kitchen remodel, and 
all underground/above ground infrastructure efforts to make all of it happen.  Additionally, the roof, wood exteriors 
(soffits), gutters and drains, as well as exterior ligh
ting are all being completely replaced.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The principal works daily with the two full
-
time and two part
-
time custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school 
is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The 
district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to k
eep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. An online work order process is used to ensure efficient service, and highest priority are 
given to emergency repairs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alt
ernate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Staff development is an important part of the planned school program at Galt Joint Union Elementary School District. The 

date on the latest educational developments. In the 
2017
-
2018, 2018
-
2019, and the 2019
-
2020 school years, three (3) Staff Development Days were provided throughout the 
school year. In 2017
-
2018, due to the adoption of new ELA/ELD curriculum, the Staff Deve
lopment days were dedicated 
on understanding how to best utilize all the resources with the curriculum, and how to instruct in an effective manner 
with the students we serve.  In 2018
-
2019, staff development was provided in the areas of Next Generation Sci
ence 
Standards (NGSS), including the planning and instruction of NGSS to students at all grade levels.  In 2019
-
2020, staff 
development was provided in the areas of Writing Instruction and creation of Writing Prompts, Early Literacy Instruction 
(SIPPS), an
d  Personal Learning Plans (Growth and Achievement). In addition, professional development has been provided 
in the areas of crisis prevention training, suicide prevention/positive school climate, CPR/First Aid, and Mandated 
Reporting.
 
 
New teachers and te
achers seeking additional assistance are supported by induction providers and mentors. They meet 
regularly with an experienced mentor to discuss their successes and challenges and new ideas for their classrooms.  
Teachers who teach in bilingual settings ar
e encouraged to attend a portion or all of a yearly conference for bilingual 
educators, called CABE, and meet regularly throughout the year to discuss the transitional bilingual program.
 
 
Furthermore, Valley Oaks has direct access to district
-
level coaches
, who work specifically with teachers and grade levels 
in the areas of reading instruction, writing instruction, Special Education, and ELD instruction/strategies.  They meet with 
and learn from these coaches in a variety of ways (in
-
class coaching, releas
e days for instruction and planning purposes, 
informal interactions 
-
 
such as email or grade
-
level meetings).
 
 
After discussion and collaboration with staff and coaches, and through formal and informal data analysis, it was 
determined that to better increa
se our early literacy results, we needed Professional Development in the areas of SIPPS 
and Writing (Step Up To Writing).  In 2016
-
2017, "Refresher" SIPPS courses were provided to all teachers of SIPPS and a 
representative from Step Up to Writing came to V
alley Oaks to provide training on effective use of the program.  In 2017
-
2018, 2018
-
2019, and 2019
-
2020 refresher SIPPS courses were made available to all and new teachers attended SIPPS 
training courses, provided by the district coach.  Additionally, teac
hers were encouraged to participate in Massive Online 
Open Courses (MOOC) that were held at Valley Oaks and many took these courses.
 
 
Regular continuous improvement in the area of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is being achieved through 
regular "
Learning Events", after school, for all teachers.  District level coaches and site
-
based science lead teachers have 
presented valuable information, training, and refreshers to our Stinger Staff.
