By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is revised yearly taking into account staff changes as well as content revisions. The Emergency 
Preparedness portion of the plan is modeled after the State Standardized Emergency Management System. 
 
The plan is dedicated to the ongoi
ng enhancement of all aspects of school safety including:
 

 
Maintenance of a safe and orderly learning environment by maintaining the buildings and grounds to a high 
standard.
 

 
Student transition to and from school with instructions on how to cross streets sa
fely and a crossing guard 
posted by the school. Along with this, there is a Transportation Safety Plan that includes instructions on how to 
board and exit the bus safely, how the red cross
-
over lights are used and annual evacuation exercises.
 

 
Student 
behavior and discipline are outlined in the plan and is given to the parents and students via the 
Student/Parent Handbook at the beginning of the school year.
 

 
Disaster preparedness is accomplished by training the staff to respond to natural disasters or 
evacuations due 
to potential hazards. Many of the staff are trained in first aid and CPR procedures along with triage, search and 
rescue and student security in the event of an emergency.
 

 
Playground and classroom facilities and equipment are inspected annu
ally with written reports of the findings. 
The play equipment has been inspected by a certified playground inspector and there is an ongoing 
maintenance program to improve the safety of the equipment. Quarterly inspection of the buildings, grounds 
and play
 
equipment is done by the Lead Custodian and documented on a standard form.
 

 
Student, parent, and staff safety training are done on an ongoing basis through in
-
services, fire and earthquake 
drills, and parent universities.
 

 
The School Safety Plan is written 
with input from all stakeholders and is reviewed by local law enforcement/first 
responders.
