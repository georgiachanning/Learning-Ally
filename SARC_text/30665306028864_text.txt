Description
 
Our mission as the Eader School Community is to provide a safe, creative, challenging learning 
environment for all students. We do this by working as a team, creatively using all of our resources 
available, and by modeling our 
expectations. Eader students will reach their full learning potentials 
and be assets to our society.
 
 
Eader Elementary School is a 2016 California Gold Ribbon School, and was the first elementary 
school in the state to earn the recognition of being a Calif
ornia Civic Learning School of Distinction 
for teaching democracy and global awareness!  Our school program consists of one three
-
year
-
old 
and one four
-
year
-
old Preschool Academy class, four Special Day Class (SDC) preschool classes, and  
nineteen general 
education classes.  Programs are offered for Gifted and Talented Education 
(GATE) students, Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) students and English Learner (EL) students 
supplementing the core curriculum, based on a traditional school calendar.  Eader'
s staff 
implements Common Core standards
-
based education while responding to the individual needs of 
students. Student progress monitoring is reviewed regularly with district benchmarks,  curriculum
-
based measures on a trimester basis, and annually with st
atewide exams. Programs unique to Eader 
are the MIND Research Institute's STMath, which is a spatial
-
temporal reasoning math program, K

5 Music Program, Science Works, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Thinking Maps, Write from 
the Beginning, and CATCH
-
PE which supplement our district
-
wide adoptions in English Language 
Arts, Math, Science, and Social Science. Teachers have been trained in DII, (Direct Interactive

ing 
made with our second through fifth grade classrooms having 1:1 student to device ratios, and a 
computer lab for our kindergarten and first grade use, in addition to their individual classroom 
computer stations.  There are Smartboards in every classroom
 
including our  conference room and 
music classroom.  Our outstanding parent involvement extends student learning and community 
building activities such as the Family Fall Festival, Family Tile Night, field trips, assemblies, and Art 
Masters. Volunteers lo
g in over 15,000 hours to programs such as Surf Tales, math centers, reading 
centers, organizing school and community fundraisers, and contributing to decision

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by st
ate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requ
ired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is t
o be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

2020 school year to determine whether or not each school had sufficient and good quality textboo
ks, instructional materials, and/or 
science laboratory equipment.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are required to be given their own individual textbooks and/or instructional materi
als (in core subjects), for use 
in the classroom. Additionally, 
all textbooks and instructional materials used within the District must be aligned with the California State Content 
Standards and frameworks, with final approval by the Board of Education.

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs at Eader Elementary School. The PTA and the McKenna
 
Claire Foundation 
have made generous contributions of time a
nd money to numerous programs and activities. PTA organizes many community events such as Family Movie 
Night, Skate Night, and the Fall Festival.   They also supplement curricular  programs in art, (Art Masters) and reading, (Ac
celerated Reader and STAR 
Re
ading.)  Classroom learning experiences are also enriched through PTA and donations which provide assemblies, field trips, an
d instructional supplies. 
Parents volunteer in classrooms, coordinate student events such as the  100 Mile Club and Ecology Recycli
ng Club, and parents are invited to participate 
in school governance through School Site Council, as well as participate on district committees such as District Advisory Com
mittee (DAC). PTA sponsors 
educational and social awareness opportunities for paren
ts and the community, such as Traffic Safety, Common Core Standards, and other topics of 
interest as they arise from the community.  Parent Education Nights have been offered free of charge, from Phoenix House Coun
seling, on pertinent 
topics such as  "Stre
ngthening Families".
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Pla
n
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following require
ments of SB 187 within their safe school plans: 
current status and assessment of school crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a high lev
el of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine
 
and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of p
upils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and makes any modifications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Sa
fe School Plan, were 
r
eviewed with school and district staff at the beginning of the 2019
-
20 school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 2020.
 
 
The district progressively addresses structural needs at each school to ensure faciliti
es are safe and comply with education codes as well as building and 
safety regulations. One automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administration building. A $169 million b
ond (Measure Q) approved 
in November 2016 provides the necessar
y funding for District
-
 
wide modernization efforts. Permanent campus perimeter fencing was completed during 
Winter 2019 to increase student safety.

District and school administrators use site trend analysis, state testing, district
-
level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to 
identify more effective methods and 
strategies to achieve positive results for teachers and students. The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services 
and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, instructional materials, implementation timelines, and
 
student ach
ievement. 
Feedback is gathered at the site level through direct input and staff observation. Periodic Curriculum Development Committees
 
are formed to address 
identified areas of need and focus. Twenty professional development days were available and held d
uring the school year which involved curriculum 
based training for ST Math, Mimio Studio Notebook, OC STEM Science training, Write from The Beginning, Stop the Bleed, Modern
ization Overlook 
training, data analysis through Professional Learning Communities 
and an additional fifteen days of teacher release time per site.
 
 
Based on the most recent trend of multiple assessments, Eader is implementing staff development to improve our ELA instructio
nal practices and 
learning.  Teachers have been given release tim
e for curriculum mapping of the new ELA adoption, devising common writing prompts, and corresponding 
standards
-
based lessons.  Release time has been used for aligning (to standards) the writing rubrics and norming each others' student e
ssays, observing 
eac
h others' lessons (on lowest performance standards of benchmark data) and vertical collaboration, observing and analyzing gra
de levels below and 
above.  Selected teachers are given additional release time to observe peers' classroom practices and instructi
on.  Professional Development has also 
been incorporated into staff meetings, and early release days on Thursdays. Teachers have had the same observation and collab
oration opportunities in 
the math content area,  being facilitated by our site math coaches,
 
and principal, as well.  Teachers new to the profession are supported by peer coaching 
and participate in the Beginning Teacher Support and Assistance program (BTSA)  through the Orange County Department of Educa
tion. Teachers are 
encouraged to attend sub
ject
-
specific seminars and major conferences and share what they learn with other staff members. Classified staff and 
instructional assistants are provided training and development opportunities at the school, district, and county levels. In
-
services for c
lassified staff are 
geared to their specialty areas.

Types of Services Funded
 
A significant portion of Eader School's categorical program budget is allocated for professional development to support impro
ved instruction. The district 
continuously explores ways to increase extended learning opportunities and improve intervention with at
-
risk students. Teachers have been trained in 
Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), STMath, and Number Talks, Thinking Maps, Mimio Studio Notebook and Wr
ite from the Beginning, for language 
development, reading, and writing.  The Kindergarten and 1st Grade teachers have also had training in Developmental Reading A
wareness (DRA), to 
target specific areas of strength and weakness in early reading skills. Int
ervention programs such as Read Naturally are used for intervention for students 
who are below proficient, and before school intervention classes are offered.
 
 
Each year a portion of Eader's Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds are used to enable sta
ff members to attend professional development 
opportunities to enhance instructional practice and expand their knowledge base. Teachers who are new to the profession are s
upported by peer 
coaching and are encouraged to attend in
-
services. Teachers who atte
nd conferences, seminars, and other events are encouraged to share what they 
learn with other staff members. In 2018
-
2019, a portion of Eader's LCFF funds were used to provide before
-
school and after
-
school intervention programs 
for students who were not p
roficient on state and district assessments; the program continues with the current school year as well.  The Beginning 
Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional support and opportunities to new teachers. The program is des
igned to as
sist those 
new to teaching to expand and deepen their teaching skills, help the school district retain more new teachers, and improve le
arning opportunities for 
students. For all teachers, the district utilizes experienced teachers to provide professional 
development choice sessions for staff development district 
wide.  Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) Program cluster classes are provided for grades 2
-
5 for GATE identified students. GATE teachers have been 
given the opportunity to attend the California 
Association of GATE Educators (CAG) conference.  All staff members are committed to creating and 
maintaining an environment in which students grow physically, emotionally, and intellectually into healthy, contributing citi
zens.
