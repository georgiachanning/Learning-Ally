Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The motto of Sierra View  Elementary School is "Teach. Learn. Every Day. No Excuses."  We adhere to this motto, because 
we know that we are entrusted with the awesome responsibility of providing an 
educational environment in which all 
students have the opportunity to succeed 
-
 
academically, socially, emotionally, and behaviorally.
 
 
Sierra View Elementary, which opened its doors to students in 2005, is a wonderful place to learn and work. In our six 
y
ears of existence, we have created a school culture that is positive and focused on student learning. Anyone walking onto 
our campus for the first time will immediately sense the commitment that staff, students, and parents have to making our 
school except
ional. It truly is a unique place that we can all be proud of.
 
 
With 73 staff members (Certificated and Classified) we have 25 general education classes and two Special Day Classes 

 
to have a music/band room, three Learning 
Lab (Title1) classrooms, a Science Lab, and a beautiful and spacious multi
-
purpose building that houses an indoor/outdoor 
stage.  Our library and computer lab are separate facilities, which enables our students to
 
have weekly visits to both.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

We have a very 
active Parent Teacher Club at our school. Our PTC also sponsors an annual Jog
-
a
-
thon fund raiser and this 
year raised an incredible $50,000 to be used for field trips, learning materials, Family Nights, and other worthwhile items 
and events.  The SVPTC is 
an extension of our school and plays an important part of our success..  Our School Site Council 
and ELAC offer another avenue for parent participation.  One day per week we have volunteers that provide additional 
reading opportunities for some of our 2nd 
grade students (SMART Readers).  Numerous parent volunteers can be seen 
daily at Sierra View as well.  These groups play an important roll in the success of Sierra View.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

Each year the Sierra View Safety Plan is reviewed and comprehensive changes may be made as needed.  The current plan 
was reviewed by the site staff, School Site 
Council, and reviewed with the PTC.  The plan was approved by the SSC in 
October 2019.  Some highlights of the plan include monthly drills which may include (but not limited to) fire, lock down, 
shelter in place, or evacuation.  The staff and students cont
inually review safety procedures.  All staff members are 
equipped with radios and the site is comprised of exterior cameras which includes all facets of the school.  The front office
 
has an interior camera.  All visitors to Sierra View must sign in in the 
front office and wear a sticker indicating that they 
have been checked in.
