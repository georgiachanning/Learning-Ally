Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Jamestown School District takes special pride in the safety, adequacy, and cleanliness of its facilities.
 
 
Most of the school was built in 1954. 
There are a number of portables, the majority of which were installed when class 
size reduction was implemented in 1996. Playground equipment consists of tetherball standards, a swing set with four 
swings, four and one
-
half full
-
size basketball courts, and
 
a giant multi
-
use toy. Kindergarten classes use a separate fenced 
facility with a swing set, merry
-
go round, and a small multi
-
use toy. All toys are maintained in safe and proper condition 
meeting all safety and compliance regulations.

A team of custodia
ns ensures classrooms, restrooms, the cafeteria, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. 
Classrooms are cleaned on a daily basis.  Restrooms are cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, and at mid
-
day a 
custodian checks the supplies and general condi
tion of each restroom. More thorough cleaning and major facility updates 

maintenance workers repair any unsafe conditions. Facility inspection rep
orts are presented to the Board of Trustees and 
maintained in the school district office for review. Recent completed facility projects include the installation of new 
insulation and lighting to the A building, replacement carpeting in one room, and exteri
or building repairs on many older 
portables. Maintenance repairs scheduled for Jamestown Elementary for the 2019
-
2020 school year include roof repairs 
of the A building and several walkways, ramp repairs for two portables and the district office, resealing
 
of the playground, 
an enclosure for the outside freezer including storage and a school store, and the addition of a shade structure for 
additional cafeteria seating.  Through the Drinking Water for Schools Grant, new ADA compliant drinking fountains and 
b
ottle filling stations will be added.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by participating in conferences and workshops throughout the year. They 
share their experience and knowledge 
with colleagues. The district annually dedicates the equivalent of three days to staff 
development, weekly early release days for staff development and grade level collaboration along with Response to 
Intervention ( RtI) meetings with staff to analyze stud
ent academic performance and interventions, and provides teachers 
and other staff work release days to attend trainings related to curriculum and instruction development and the 
implementation of district goals. Professional development is also tied to LCA
P goals and objectives. For the 2017
-
18 
school year the district contracted with a behavioral specialist for individual in
-
class coaching and mentoring for specific 
student behavior needs and classroom environment strategies and this is continuing into the
 
2018
-
19 school year. Support 
for teachers is implemented through in class observations and coaching, meetings with the principal. New teachers are 
paired with a teacher mentor.
