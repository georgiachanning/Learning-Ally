The annual school report 
was established as an accountability component of Proposition 98, passed by the 
California voters in November, 1988. This report, which is to be issued by all elementary and secondary schools 
in the State, will give you information about Coolidge: Our prog
rams, successes, resources, and the areas in 
which we need to grow.
 
 
This annual report describes a school that has a history of solid academic achievement with a strong 
commitment to student needs. The staff at Coolidge is dedicated to our students, 
setting high expectations, 
and providing the motivation for student excellence. In 2002 and 2012, Coolidge Elementary School was

C
ommunity & School Profile (School Year 2019
-
20):
 

Unified School District educates more than 5,200 kindergarten through twelfth grade students on a trad
itional 
calendar schedule. Established in 1781, the San Gabriel Mission was the fourth California mission and is 
considered the birthplace of the Los Angeles region. San Gabriel Unified School District was founded in 1868 
and is proud of its long tradition
 
of academic excellence. The district is currently comprised of five elementary 
schools, one middle school, one traditional high school, and one continuation high school.
 
 
Coolidge Elementary School is dedicated to ensuring the academic success of all stud
ents, and provides the 
most comprehensive educational experience possible. All programs at the school are founded on the principle 
that students come first.  Coolidge Elementary is embarking on the school transformation model "The Leader 
in Me," which is b
ased upon Stephen Covey's book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."  Published in 
1989, it has sold over 25 million copies and has transformed millions of lives and countless organizations, 
businesses and schools.  The Leader in Me framework seeks to
 
transform our paradigm and approach to 
students, to impact their lives in a positive manner and give them the tools to succeed in life.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g.,
 
test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
Calif
ornia State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (dependin
g on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 11,
 
2018 and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learn
ers, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Califor
nia Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teac
hers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
The table displays information collected in October 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
