By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
West Heritage Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in
 
1989. Ongoing maintenance ensures school facilities 
are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
West Heritage Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general 
housekeeping 
practices. Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenanc
e and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. School office staff are responsible for 
the preparation and submission of work orders to M&O for r
esolution. Emergency situations are given high priority and 
resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.

The principal and day custodian communicate on a daily basis to discuss campus maintenance and safety concerns. Once 
a month, the princip
al and custodian review the schedule for the next month school events and setup needs. The director 
of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related issues 
associated with campus upkeep, safety, class
room space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders (submitted and 
outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct a comprehensive 
inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is f
orwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report on the current condition of facilities. The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this rep

M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully 

ng the staff lounge, stocking student restrooms, and cleaning the 
cafeteria after meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities for safety
 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before sta
ff and students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of 
vandalism are removed immediately. Restrooms are frequently checked throughout the day as a proactive measure in 
keeping restrooms safe, stocked, and sanitary.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is
 
responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
