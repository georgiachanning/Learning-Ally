By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Monte Vista 
was built in 1951, with additional construction in the 1960's, making the school 68 years old. In 2010 two rooms were 
renovated with the support of Target Corporation, H
eart of America Foundation and funding from OMSD. Classroom D1 
was transformed into a state
-
of
-
the
-
art computer lab and classroom D
-
2 became our new school library.
 
 
To promote safety, Monte Vista Elementary School is a closed campus; gates are closed duri
ng the school day and visitors 
must enter through the main office to sign in at front desk prior to entering school premises. Visitors must present their 
California ID badges and staff must present their district badge through our RAPTOR system. Signage ha
s been placed at 
all gates directing visitors to check in at the office.  All staff members have been provided with district ID badges.  Monte
 
Vista Elementary School offers student supervision before school, during school. and after school.  Supervision i
n the 
mornings is done by administrative team, support team and proctors.  Recess and lunch duty supervision is offered by 
proctors. After school supervision is offered by administrative team, support staff, teachers and proctors.
 
 
District maintenance sta
ff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
The governing b
oard has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards are 
available at the school office or at the district office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop clean
ing 
schedules to ensure a cle
an and safe school. 2 full
-
time and 1
-
half time custodians are employed at the school. They each 
have an individual daily schedule of the school grounds/classrooms that they are responsible for cleaning and maintaining. 
Restrooms are checked twice a day fo
r cleanliness, restocking soap and paper towels, and spot
-
cleaning. One hundred 
percent of the toilets are functional. The classrooms are cleaned on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday 
(vacuumed, swept, trash empties, dusted and wet moped). Th
e classrooms are deep cleaned during student vacation 
times. The Operations Department is responsible for deferred Maintenance.
 
 
The district conducted a Facility Inspection on November 14, 2019. The results were listed in the Facility Inspection Tool 
(FIT
). 101 areas were evaluated in 8 categories. The average percentage of good repair was 97.96% for a School Rating of 
Good. Monte Vista was not required to have a Williams Inspection.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

We as a staff at Monte Vista are dedicated to ensuring that children achieve academic success. Vital to the success of 
children is a close connection between home and school. We welcome parent and community input, questions, and 
involvement in the students
' educational experience. We consider all stakeholders to be part of the Monte Vista School 
Family and we are active in involving parents and the community. At Back to School Night there are many opportunities 
for parents to sign up for numerous school gro
ups to become active on campus, in addition to the "traditional" parent 
involvement such as Parent Conferences. We also have an active PTO and welcome all parents to become involved in this 
wonderful parent group. The School Site Council and Coffee with th
e Principal provide opportunities for parents to get 
involved with their child's educational experience. Regular school

Staff development is based on district initiatives, individual school, student, and teacher needs. Teacher surveys and 
principal observations also help determine professional needs. However, student data, district, and state testing are the 
primary factors
 
in guiding and determining staff development areas. The focus of our staff development has been 
predominantly in the areas of Language Arts, Math, Common Core Standards, and Positive Behavioral Interventions and 
Support (PBIS). Teachers work in grade leve
l collaboration meetings to analyze students data, create action plans, and 
discuss, model, and observe best practices. Professional development occurs throughout the school year including after
-
school workshops, conference attendance, individual mentoring
, and after
-
school professional study meetings 3 times per 
month. These pieces of training include paraprofessionals both at the site and district level. Monte Vista employs an 
Elementary Administrator, who is available to facilitate grade level meetings, 
and provides support to teachers on an 
individual base by assisting in reading instruction, observing, and providing feedback via a weekly walk through. OMSD 
provides ongoing teacher training in Math and Language Arts. The Principal monitors performance an
d offers feedback 
via a weekly walk through. Grade level teams are given 1 hour of release time monthly to meet and analyze student 
assessment data and to collaborate. They have a room of their own in which to meet, Internet access, and wireless laptop 
com
puter. The Principal is available to meet with teachers and provide support. In addition, teachers have two hours of 
planning time each week to create and prepare lessons. All non
-
instructional support staff including clerical, custodial, 
and proctors meet
 
with an Administrator at least once per month in their respective groups to present information and 
for collaboration and training. The goals of these meetings are to contribute to a positive and collaborative school culture 
and to facilitate continuous i
mprovement.
