School Description
 
Welcome to the South Oceanside Elementary School community. Our goal is to provide students 
with the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to build a solid foundation for further 
academic success. We start with high academic standards for all lear
ners, and we instill in them a 
love of learning and a desire to work to their full potentials.
 
 
Our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement features instructional goals that focus on increasing 
student achievement in reading and mathematics based on the 
Common Core State Standards and 
continuing to grow in parental involvement.
 
 
South Oceanside Elementary has been a California Distinguished School three times, the highest 
honor granted a school by the state of California. South Oceanside has also been rec
ognized twice 
as a Title I Academic Achievement Award School, a federal award for schools that receive federal 
funding that consistently help low
-
performing students meet or exceed academic performance 
goals.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Califor
nia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational age
ncies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data rep
orted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/t
a/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community member
s should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
