About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Palm View Elementary is currently a portable site on the south side of campus while the school is under construction. The ent
ire school, which was built 
in 1939 was demolished, in preparation for construction for the new school facility. 
 
 
District mainten
ance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timel
y manner. A 
work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. Emergency repa
irs are given the highest 
priority. Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects the school perimeter and facilities for safety hazards o
r other conditions that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One day custo
dian and one evening custodian is assigned to Palm View Elementary School. 
Restrooms are checked regularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. 
 
 
The day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Auditorium
 

 
Cafeteria Cleanup/Setup

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
