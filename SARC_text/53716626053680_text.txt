School Description
 
Burnt Ranch School is committed to providing a balanced quality education in a safe learning 
environment for our 
students, staff, and community. We believe in dignity and respect for everyone 
at Burnt Ranch School.
 
 
Burnt Ranch Elementary School District is a one
-
school district, serving Transitional Kindergarten 
through eighth grade. We are located in a rural part o
f western Trinity County in Northwestern 
California. The Burnt Ranch community has approximately 350 inhabitants. Many of our students 
also reside in the Hawkins Bar, Salyer and Willow Creek communities, which are up to twenty miles 
from our school site. W
e have strong community support with dependable parent involvement. 
Our community strengths also include our extended families, alumni, small businesses and farms, 
river sports, and a beautiful area in which to live.  Stores and basic services are mostly l
ocated 
across the county line, in Humboldt County.
 
 
Our enrollment is 87 students in the 2019
-
20 school year. Student
-
to
-
teacher ratio for Kindergarten 
through grade eight averages 13:1. The school has grown from a one
-
room schoolhouse in 1895 
located near
 
a Chimariko Indian village and the historic Pony Express Trail, to the present facility 
which was originally built in 1962 and 1987 but has now been rebuilt with final completion in 2019. 
The campus includes a 2.5
-
acre playing field, with a track, basebal
l diamond, soccer area, basketball 
courts and a playground. Picnic tables in the sun and under a shade structure offer an outdoor 
lunch space during warm weather.
 
 
Burnt Ranch School has a 21st Century learning program with technology integration in every 
classroom. Each class has a set of iPads and/or chrome books with a student to device ratio 
averaging 1:1; one or more laptop or desktop computers; a Smart Board; projector; and document 
camera. Students use technology for differentiated instruction, asses
sment, research, 
collaboration, learning common applications for success in the digital world, and for digital projects 
that demonstrate mastery of both content and skills in core
-
curriculum. A Technology Specialist 
supports teacher use of technology for i
nstruction.
 
 
The school offers an after
-
school program until 5:00 pm each day with supplemental education 
services and enrichment activities for all students. Homework help and a healthy snack are 
provided every day. Students also participate in activities
 
such as art, music, volleyball, soccer or 
basketball, cooking class, biking, STEAM projects, theater, and gardening. We provide academic 
intervention services, both during and after school, for students scoring below proficiency on state 
or district bench
mark assessments.
 
 
We have a dynamic Indian Education program that contributes a cultural context to our program.  
Throughout the school year, a variety of Native culture activities and demonstrations take place at 
the school. Native students are offered s
upplemental academic support when needed.
 
 
Burnt Ranch School is a friendly community of learners with a positive school climate and daily 
demonstration of respect for all members of the community, the facility, and the surrounding 
environment.

About the SARC
 
By Feb
ruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fun
ding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state
 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the s
chool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Burnt Ranch School, we recognize that paren

education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school environment. Parents can be invo
lved in many ways at our 
s
chool such as volunteering in the classroom, fundraising for school field trips, helping in the after school program, volunte
ering to teach a special subject, 
or coaching a school sport. Parents are invited to become LCAP Advisory Committee members, attend
 
other school advisory meetings, be part of the 
Indian Education Parent Committee, or join the PTO. We regularly provide opportunities for parents to join in events at BRS, 
such as our school
-
wide 
assemblies, Back to School Night, the annual Art Show, musi
c and drama performances, Family Nights, parent conferences, and special occasions such 
as the Harvest Festival, classroom celebrations, the annual Mt. Shasta snow trip, and the end of year Beach & Kayak day. We e
ncourage Love and Logic 
parent training so 
that more parents can learn the philosophy and strategies that our staff uses to successfully support positive student behavi
or.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension ra
tes;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Burnt Ranch School has an up
-
to
-
date School Safety Plan developed by staff, administration, parents, and community members and approved by the 
School Site 
Council/Safety Committee (1/28/19) and Board of Trustees (2/14/19) each year. Drills for fire, evacuation, earthquake, and lo
ckdown are 
conducted to ensure that all staff and students are familiar with and ready to carry out all emergency procedures at any
 
time of the day and during any 
school activity.
 
All buildings have been replaced or remodeled on the campus, with a new fire alarm system and an intercom/clock/bell system. 
Phones in every classroom 
have intercom capabilities for safety announcements and 
a school set of radios was purchased in 2013 for communication across the site. Visitors and 
volunteers must check
-
in and out at the school office. Staff will question anyone who comes on site who is unknown to the school community. We have
 
a fire safe sch
ool site with collaboration from the Trinity County Fire Safe Council, CalFire and the USFS. The School Safety Plan is review
ed, updated, and 
discussed with the school staff annually, and information about safety is included in the Student/Parent Handbook.
