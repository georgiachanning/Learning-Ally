About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Cali
fornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data 
reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/t
a/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community mem
bers should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Arcata Elementary School is located on a quiet neighborhood street in Arcata, California. The front of the school is lined wi
th flowering cherry trees, well
-
manicured lawns, green foliage and flowering plants. 
Arcata Elementary has two well
-
designed parking lots and off
-
street parking that provide ample 
space for staff and visitors. We have large grassy playing fields, a large blacktop for games and two areas with play and cli
mbing structures. Parent 
volunteers 
and school staff installed a new $30,000 play structure, which was purchased by the PTO and API funds.  In September 2013, AE
S started a 
vermi
-
composting program which is now thriving. The school garden was improved and now includes a new garden area with 
raised beds, one for each 
class and the after school educational program. The school has worked with the City of Arcata to build a nature trail with na
tive plants along the north 
end of campus above Sunset Creek.The nature trail is used by classes througho
ut the school year.
 
 
The Arcata Elementary School site consists of 20 classrooms, which accommodate transitional kindergarten through fifth grade,
 
a Resource Specialist 
Program, a Special Day Class, a Family Resource Center, and the kindergarten/first grad
e after school education program. Our school library is located in 
the heart of our school and it features an extensive book collection. The Arcata Elementary site has a speech and language sp
ecialist room, an English 
Learner Language resource room, the sc
hool psychologist's office, a nurse's office, a multipurpose room, the front office, a staff room, a workroom, and 
several storage rooms. The bus garage and maintenance buildings are located at the Arcata Elementary School site. The Arcata 
Elementary site 
has a 
mobile carts with Chromebooks for use in the classroom and other device to support technology skill building.
 
 
In addition, two portable buildings house the after school program for grades 2
-
3 and the Arcata Family Resource Center. A modular building
, with over 
2300 square feet, houses the after school education program and the preschool program.
 
 
The multipurpose room is used as a cafeteria, as well as for physical education classes, assemblies, and daytime and evening 
student drama performances. 
The
 
custodial/maintenance team maintain the facilities and grounds. As a result of the  passage of our School Bond through Measur
e F, modernization 
of AES classrooms, multipurpose room, bathrooms, and resurfacing of all paved areas happened during the summer 
of 2014.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We welcome and apprec
iate the many ways that Arcata Elementary School parents and community members strengthen our school through their 
support from home and involvement in the classrooms. It is our belief that a sense of family and community is the fundamental
 
force in the de
velopment 
of a child. We believe that parents are the most important and influential teachers of their children. Therefore, we encourag
e and maintain a strong 
parental and community partnership. Getting involved sends a critical message to children. Educat
ion is important!
 
 
There are a number of opportunities for parental involvement at Arcata Elementary School. When parents get connected to the s
chool, children get 
better grades, do better on tests, and have fewer discipline problems.  When you build a rel

staff, it will be far easier to communicate about any problem (or victory) that occurs throughout the year.  There are severa
l ways you can contribute to 
the school community.
 
 
At AES we have two 
levels of volunteers:
 
Level 2 Volunteer 
-
 
Classroom Parent, weekly classroom volunteers, one or more field trips, 2nd grade parents to help during swimming lessons in 
the 
Spring
 
Volunteer form on file and volunteers will need to be fingerprinted and have a
 
current TB test
 
Level 1 Volunteer 
-
 
One field trip and in classroom 1
-
3 times per year
 
Volunteer form on file
 
 
Classrooms: Each year teachers ask for volunteers for the classroom and the time commitment varies by grade level. Sometimes 
they ask for a 
comm
itment for a single field trip and other times they ask for a volunteer in the classroom at the same time each week to help w
ith an activity.
 
Time Commitment: approximately 1 hour per week
 
Volunteers need a Level 2 Volunteer Clearance

Field trips: Experie
nces outside of the classroom give students a chance to connect classroom lessons to real
-
life experiences and tangible artifacts. They 
give students access to culture, history, and art that may be left out of the regular curriculum. The sensory, physical,
 
and social aspects of field trips 
enrich learning experiences.
 
Time Commitment: varies depending on activity
 
Volunteers need a Level 2 Volunteer Clearance (more than one field trip)
 
 
PTO: The PTO needs volunteers to help with events and activities through
out the year.  For the upcoming school year we will be asking for a parent (or

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School
 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The District Safety Committee has worked diligently to set the direction for the entire district. A 
district
-
wide safety plan exists for all disaster situations. 
The Arcata Elementary School Plan is revised each year to meet the needs of the school and change in personnel. The committee
 
utilized the District 
Safety Committee to assist with this revision.
 
Information gathered from parents, students and staff was used to determine area need.
 
 
Arcata Elementary School has a long history of low crime rate, with only a few incidences of vandalism in the past several ye
ars. Additionally, security 
cameras for th
e safety and well
-
being of students and staff were installed during the 2014 summer remodel.
 
 
There have been no crimes against students or staff. The school campus is secure during all school hours. Visitors sign in an
d out at the front office and

In order to reinforce consistency, a school
-
wide assembly is held each school year to introduce all staff members to the students, meet new students and 
to discuss rules and appropriate behaviors. Students
 
and staff are encouraged to add positive comments or bring up issues that concern the school. 
Additional gatherings are held throughout the year to reinforce and remind students and staff of student expectations. To ens
ure a safe learning 
environment, the
 
staff consistently enforces school, bus and classroom rules.
 
 
Arcata Elementary School uses the Second Step Program, which is an anti
-
violence and bullying prevention program. The program is part of our Safe 
School Plan. During the summer of 2008, a team 
of administrators and teachers were trained as trainers in this program. AES also utilizes Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS).  PBIS is a proactive approach to establishing the behavioral supports and social culture a
nd needed for all stud
ents in 
a school to achieve social, emotional and academic success.Then on the first staff development day, they met with teachers, s
upport staff, other school 
personnel, district board members, and site council members to train them in this anti
-
violence/
 
anti
-
bullying program. Parent involvement is a critical 
component of this implementation plan.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Arcata School District schedules minimum days each Monday during the academic 
school year. This time is used for professional development, grade 
level collaboration, and planning. Twelve minimum days are set aside for fall and winter parent conferences.  Teachers and pa
raprofessional staff are 
encouraged to attend professional devel
opment training throughout the school year. Substitutes and funds to pay for the trainings are provided, using 
school site funds and district professional development funds.
 
 
Because of the wealth of professional development opportunities offered through H
umboldt County Office of Education (HCOE), staff in the Arcata School 
District are able to avail ourselves of many excellent workshops and classes that are aligned to the State Standards. Parapro
fessionals and teachers have 
attended several workshops for t
raining in the areas of reading, mathematics, working with students with Autism, and behavior management techniques. 
Teachers at Arcata Elementary School have attended workshops to support our adopted reading and writing programs, Google Apps
 
for Education
, 
STEAM, and have been using these program and methodologies consistently in the classroom, as homework, and have already obser
ved academic 
improvement in language skills.
 
 
Classroom assistants and yard supervisors attend monthly meetings covering a variet
y of topics pertinent to their jobs. In addition, we utilize our teachers 
and staff to share information and provide training from conferences, local experts and out
