By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions
 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mineral King Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to 
support teaching and learning. This 
includes space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School C
onstruction. The results of 
this survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may b
e 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff en
sures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
In 2016
-
2017, there
 
were no major maintenance or repair projects. No other emergency facilities needs exist at this school.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for 
daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance P
rogram, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditio
ning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improve
ments
 
During the 2016
-
2017 school year, routine maintenance was completed.
 
We are currently preparing for future remodeling facilities improvements that may begin sometime in August 2018.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Mineral King Elementary School.  Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school grounds 
before, during, and after school.  Entrances to school grounds are secured by fencing 
or monitored during the school day.  All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on 
campus. Mineral King has one single point of ent
ry to the campus through the office.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and inter
vention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated 
as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at
 
the school 
office.  The School Safety Plan was reviewed by staff and parents; and approved in October 2018.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The following areas of professional development has been provided to staff: professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by site data.  Our district provides 
professional 
development based off of data from both the district and site level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, site and classroom level dependent on teacher goals.   The district 
provide
s Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, twenty percent of Visalia U


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and t
raining system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day inte
ractive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is of
fered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor a
t their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with studen
t data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignment
 
are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program which
 
is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in the case of a new gra
de level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
 
 
Mineral King staff has on

going learning that is driven by teachers recommendations
 
and data. (Technology inservices lead
