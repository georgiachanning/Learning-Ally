By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to the home of the Panorama Panthers!  Our school has served as the pride of its community for more than 50 
years, and is a top
-
achieving school in the State of 
California. We serve approximately 430, Transitional Kindergarten
-
6th 
grade, highly motivated students who are challenged daily in a 21st Century, data driven, rigorous environment. The 
school is proud of its neighborhood feel, where parents play an integr
al part in the education of their children. Stepping 
on to our welcoming and well maintained campus, you cannot help but catch our highly contagious Panther Pride. 
Panorama Elementary School provides a strong academic focus for our students along with an e
nvironment that supports 

s 
for teachers.  At Panorama Elementary we feel privileged to be entrusted with our students and do not ta
ke our 
responsibility lightly. Go Panthers!!
 
 
All students will leave Panorama Elementary as lifelong, 21st Century learners with the ability to think critically, collabor
ate 
effectively, communicate clearly and create with purposeful expression in a diver
se, digital world.
 
 
Panorama Elementary is dedicated to maximizing the social, emotional and academic achievement of each and every 
student in a safe and orderly environment.  Panthers CARE (Courtesy, Achievement and Responsibility for Everyone) 
reminds ea
ch Panther of the importance of exuding our Panther Pride at all times. Go Panthers!!!
 
 
At Panorama, we have placed a huge emphasis in technology in the classroom.  We have one to one Chromebooks in 
grades 4th through 6th in our school,  Furthermore, we ha
ve over 20 iPads used in each of our primary grades (K  2).
 
 
Panorama's site
-
based Theory of Action was written by a group of staff members that represented the teachers, as part 
of our CCSS Transition Team duties.  The Theory of Action targets all student
s, with emphasis on scaffolding and 
differentiation for under
-
performing student subgroups.  It is a fluid document that will be reviewed and revised as the 
school's needs change as well:
 
 
School personnel decided that last year's Theory of Action was not to be dismissed.  The staff added areas of the curriculum 
but is not ready to create completely new goals.  The 2019
-
20 Theory of Action states: "If teachers utilize a balanced 
instructiona
l design that fosters a learning environment which promotes personal and academic growth through 
challenges and successes and provides strategies that endorse a purposeful use of technology, then students will 
demonstrate deep understanding of mathematical
 
practices, ELA and social studies/science concepts through various 
means of communication."

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
ed their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Child Welfare and Attendance. The office of School and Community Services provides plan development assistance to the 
schools and maintains a file of
 
individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
Panorama Elementary School provides a safe and positive learning environment for all students. Gates are locked during 
the day to prevent unauthorized access to the school grounds. To mainta
in security, visitors to our school are required to 
enter through the office and check
-
in for identification purposes. This year with the financial support of our PTA, Panorama 
will have an electronic check
-
in system beginning in the 2019
-
2020 school year,
 
called School Safe ID which scans each 
volunteer/visitor's State
-
issued ID and checks the sex offender database and gives instant notifications to the principal.
 
 
Teachers are trained in district procedures regarding student safety. Maintaining the safety
 
and functionality of Panorama 
Elementary is of utmost importance. Classroom doors are kept locked during the day, and each room is equipped with a 
"Lock Blok" device in order to make lock
-
down situations more safe for teachers.  A comprehensive safety and
 
disaster 
plan is in effect and practiced twice a year. Fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. Panorama's PTA 
purchased equipment and supplies for every classroom for emergency use.

Panorama's Theory of Action for the 2019
-
2020 school
-
year is as follows:
 
 
School personnel decided that last year's Theory of Action was not to be dismissed.  The staff added areas of the curriculum 
but is not ready to create completely new goals.  The 2019
-
20 Theory of Action states: "If teachers utilize a balanced 
instructiona
l design that fosters a learning environment which promotes personal and academic growth through 
challenges and successes and provides strategies that endorse a purposeful use of technology, then students will 
demonstrate deep understanding of mathematical
 
practices, ELA and social studies/science concepts through various 
means of communication."
 
In order to achieve this goal, we focused our training on specific strategies and best practices, including; our District
-
adopted ELA program, Wonders, Thinking Ma
ps, Write From the Beginning and beyond, RTI (2), Vocabulary Development, 
GLAD, and Progress Monitoring using DIBELS Next.  Teachers have been trained to utilize VPort, , the online portion of 
DIBELS Next. In addition, many of them take advantage of PowerS
chool, in order to maintain open communication with 
families.  Panorama's 4th, 5th, and 6th
-
grade students also are AVID trained and have implemented BYOD (Bring Your 
Own Device) in their classrooms.  They are supported one day per week by an Instructional
 
Specialist from Educational 
Technology at OUSD.
 
Our District focus, this year, is our District
-
adopted ELA Program, Wonders, as well as continuing to focus on writing in the 
21st Century.  As a district, we have adopted Wonders for ELA and Write From the 
Beginning and Beyond (WFTB) for 
grades K
-
6.   Teachers get trained in Wonders and WFTB as well as mathematics strategies using the District
-
adopted 
enVision Math program once a month, as well as a site professional development that have included training o
n Direct 
Instruction, Student Engagement, Technology in the Classroom, etc.  Our teachers continue to participate in training on 
WFTB as well. Training was provided by Panorama and district staff, and time was given for planning.  Follow up planning 
and fo
r implementation of these units is done during modified Wednesdays.
 
The "Growth Mindset" continues to be an emphasis at Panorama. Well versed in Carol Dweck's research at Stanford, the 
Panorama staff incorporates Growth Mindset into both daily lessons and 
standalone lessons.  Growth Mindset can be 
seen in teacher comments, student discussions, on bulletin boards, woven into lessons, etc.
 
Kindergarten and Fourth through Sixth grade have now been trained in AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination).  
Th
is marks Panorama's fourth year doing AVID  and the site plan involves organization and Individual Determination.
 
This year's Theory of Action also contains a focus on purposeful technology.  Technology continues to be an area of 
emphasis and an integral p
iece of the instructional program and it is utilized to increase engagement and academic 
achievement. The focus of the Panorama technology plan is to integrate technology as a tool for learning, rather than an 
end in itself. Students have access to the use
 
of technology for communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and 
creativity daily.  Third, through sixth grade have one to one Chromebooks and Kindergarten through second grade have a 
minimum of 20 iPads in each classroom. Digital Literacy is highli
ghted as students work as responsible digital citizens.
 
The Panorama staff consistently achieves and maintains the highest academic standards for all students. Panorama 
educators are expected to continually grow as educators by attending professional devel
opment opportunities and 
building an internal expertise.   Teachers in grades K
-
2 attended "Daily Five" training, and work together on 
implementation.  They have opportunities to observe each other, and visit other district schools that are further along i
n 
implementation.
 

-
site teacher mentoring, 
staff meetings, conferences, and school
-
based in
-
service meetings.  Master Teachers, who support student teachers from 
va
rious local universities, have received specific training in Common Core implementation and coaching.   Modified 
Wednesdays allow all grade levels at Panorama to meet weekly as a full staff and in  Professional Learning Communities.  
In addition, all staff
 
meets twice a month for professional development training and staff meetings.
