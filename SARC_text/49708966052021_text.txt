By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description
 
Located in the heart of Sonoma County, our school is one of eight elementary schools in the Rincon Valley Union School 
District.  We serve approximately 400 students in Transition
al Kindergarten through Sixth Grade.  Madrone Elementary 
School has a strong reputation for a nurturing yet challenging commitment to the education of our children. Teachers, 
staff, and the administrator believe and provide programs on the principle that s
tudents come first. Madrone is dedicated 
to ensuring the academic success of every student.  We provide them with a comprehensive educational experience that 
hopefully will become an integral part of their lives.
 
 
All grades are provided instruction in acc
ordance with the curriculum adopted by the Rincon Valley Union School District 
Board of Education.  We focus, at all grade levels, on the development of literacy, communication, math computation, 
and problem solving.  We strive to meet the needs of every c
hild through the collaborative efforts of parents, teachers, 
support staff, and students. In addition to the core curriculum, students receive instruction in technology, art, music, and 
physical education. All classrooms have access and visit our school li
brary, computer lab, and science lab weekly.  In 
addition to our computer lab, students have access to iPads and Chromebooks that are regularly used in the classroom as 
part of their daily learning.
 
 
Classroom teachers utilize differentiated instructional 
programs to meet the needs of diverse learners in their classroom.  
We provide targeted intervention and/or enrichment programs for our gifted and talented students, as well as specialized 
support and English Language Development instruction from the class
room teacher and an English Learner assistant for 
our English Language Learners.

a Madrone Elementary School App, frequent flyers, and our marquee represent the partnership that exists between 
parents, teachers, and students. Our business partnerships continue to g
row as we expand our capacity to provide a real 
world education. We are a vibrant learning community with an abundance of positive opportunities for all students.  
Learning doesn't happen in isolation, and we strive to include all stakeholders working toge

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and wo
rking order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.   A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school'
s needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, Measure D, and state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Austin Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. Village 
School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as recent replacement of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the other five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, cabinetr
y, heating 
systems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker boards. Each multi
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media centers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administrative win
g of each school was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs, a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.
 
 
During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure F and local reserves were utilized for modernization of the 
Matanzas
 
campus.  Included were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled office complex, and 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction of several classrooms, including a 
shared music building.  In August 2
017 the Madrone and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a music room.  A new play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made to the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Village opened up with a major ren
ovation to the classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, and landscaping improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the schools, with the other schools to be completed in the next two years.  
All schools have now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will receive improvements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Board has identified the following as key goals for the Measure F program
. To ensure the 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable classrooms with modular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency components such as HVAC, lighting, and window systems.
 
 
Cleaning standar
ds have been adopted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance and Operations 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cleaning standards are being upheld. In 
addition, the principal communic
ates daily with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
proactive with maintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under this plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, elect
rical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP). With a focus on High Quality Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of annual inservice, 
monthly "Distri
ct Wednesday" workshops on topics of interest/need (8 total), approximately 20 district
-
sponsored after 
school trainings annually, and 2
-
3 planning days throughout the year. A critical component of our professional 
development plan is coaching and mentorin
g through our Consulting Teacher program.  In addition, professional 
development opportunities are offered through attendance at Sonoma County Office of Education classes and educational 
conferences. For 2017
-
18, our topics of focus are English Language De
velopment, Technology Skills, Common Core ELA 
and Math standards implementation, and an incremental roll out of the Next Generation Science Standards.

Austin Creek and Rincon Valley has been focused on improving our math scores for students in grades 3
-
6 as measured 
by the SBAC, and improving English language acquisition for our English learner students as determined by our re
-
designation 
rates on the former CELDT and current ELPAC tests.
 
We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards these goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic growth for our English learners we use the RenL
earn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting grade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC and the SBAC to review the effectiveness of 
our
 

math progress by reviewing Eureka Math end
-
of
-
module assessments, students in grades 1
-
6 also take MobyMax 
placement tests two times per yea
r, and students in grades 3
-
6 take the SBAC summative assessment 1 time per year.
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the LCAP. With a focus on High Quality 
Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three 
full
-
days of professional development trainings, 2
-
3 grade level planning 
days yearly, 8 monthly "District Wednesday" professional development sessions, and approximately 20 district
-
sponsored 
after school trainings.   Teachers can also attend professional
 
development opportunities through Sonoma County Office 

 
Teachers are supported in meeting our LCAP goals with coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher Program, 
teacher
-
principal meetings, and 
grade level PLC teams.  The support is focused analyzing student assessment data to plan 
curriculum and make instructional choices which support teacher and student growth.
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the district administration and school site principa
ls participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with the 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions of Teaching and Leadership.  The administration
 
team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in our classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this professional development to include two 
teachers fr
om each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional 
development in the framework through CEL.
