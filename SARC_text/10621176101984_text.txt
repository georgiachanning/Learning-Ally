A
s you read this School Accountability Report Card (SARC) for Mickey Cox Elementary School, I 
believe you will find a picture of a school with a high degree of community involvement, a faculty 
that is professionally skilled and personally committed to meeti
ng the learning needs of students, 
and a student body that is motivated to excel.
 
 
At Mickey Cox Elementary, we believe that all students should experience academic growth each 
year. We believe that cocurricular activities nurture the whole child and encou
rage school 
ownership. We believe that each shareholder must feel a commitment and a personal responsibility 

mission and goals, which are currently in 
line with our newly revised School Site Plan. Our efforts 
have been rewarded and validated by being named a California Distinguished School during the 
2009
-
10 and 20017
-
18 school years. In 2016, Mickey Cox was honored by being named a Gold 
Ribbon School fo
r outstanding academic achievement and received the prestigious Title I Academic 
Achievement Award. In the 2011 through 2018 school years, Mickey Cox was recognized as a high
-
achievement school and awarded the California Business for Education Excellence A
ward.
 
 
Our goal for the current school year is to continue to close the achievement gap and validate the 
collaborative efforts of our students, staff and community.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Cheryl Floth
 
Principal

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Mickey Cox Elementary was built in 1980 and is 39 years old. Mickey Cox has 22 permanent and three portable classrooms to acc
ommodate our student 
body. These portables, along with the office facilities
, multipurpose room, library media center, snack bar and restroom facilities are adequate to support 
our instructional pro
-
grams. Our facilities also provide students with access to a wide variety of instructional materials, including workbooks; sc
ience ki
ts; 
math manipulatives; a library collection of more than 17,000 books, averaging 28 books per student; and a vast collection of 
instructional videos. In 
addition, students have access to computers in their classroom and a computer lab in the library media
 
center.
 
 
Mickey Cox has many athletic fields that are used for recess, sports, and other co
-
curricular activities during and outside of the school day. Various 
community groups utilize the fields in the evenings and on the weekends.
 
 
We provide a safe and
 
clean environment for learning. Our custodial staff is exceptional, and evidence of their hard work has been recognized many 
times by our community and district.
 
 
Our plant supervisor, one full
-
time and one part
-
time custodian maintain the school daily an
d perform basic cleaning operations. In addition, our facilities 
go through deep cleaning twice a year to maintain our pristine campus. Members of our SART committee conduct eight clean
-
campus inspections each 
year. Feedback from these inspections is share
d with our students, staff and community. When asked to grade how well the buildings and grounds are 

 
 
Graffiti is removed immediately, and everyone on cam
pus makes it his or her responsibility to keep the campus clean. Through increased community 
aware
-
ness, school pride and an open
-
campus policy, we continue to keep vandalism and burglary incidents relatively low. New cameras were installed 
in 2016 as an a
dditional safety measure. Additionally, CUSD provides a police officer to each secondary site and an additional officer is av
ail
-
able for any 
elementary safety concerns or collaborative effort. A full
-
time dispatch position has been added to our police ser
vices allowing for quick response times.
 
 
Keeping our campus secure is always one of the top priorities, so strategic measures are taken to keep our students safe. Sta
ff performs supervisory duty 
on the grounds 25 minutes before school begins, during all r
ecesses and after school. Parent Club also provides volunteers for supervision before and 
after the regular school day. During lunch hours, four campus monitors support our safety plan by supervising our students. W
e are proud of the fact 
that all staff, i
ncluding campus monitors, have participated in safety training. We further promote our safety plan by requiring that all visi
tors and 
volunteers fill out a volunteer form, compete a tuberculosis assessment, and are cross
-

e prior to being given access 

 
 
Philosophically, the district believes that schools are the focal point of their neighborhoods. As a result, we place a
 
high priority on building and 
maintaining excellent facilities. In 2012, voters within the CUSD boundaries approved Measure A. With the Measure A and bond 
monies, many older 
CUSD schools were modernized and improved. As part of the remodel, the office are

lighting upgrades and new touch
-
board projectors. Construction began in April 2016 and was completed in January 2017. In August of 2018, our MPR 
was completely remodeled. Polished concrete wa
s installed, our sound system was upgraded and stage lighting and curtains were re
-
placed. One of the 
points of pride and joy in the remodeled MPR is the state
-
of
-
the
-
art filtered water fountain and refillable water bottle station. Students can read the 
me
ter on the water station to see how many plastic water bottles were saved by using the water station.

School Safety Plan
 
Mickey Cox Elementary has a School Safety Plan and School Crisis Intervention Plan on fil
e, and update both annually. Procedures for emergencies (such 
as fire, intruder, earthquake, lock down) that may occur on campus are described in the document, conveyed to all staff and p
racticed monthly with 
students.  Most recently, the school safety pla
n was reviewed, updated and discussed with the school staff in August 2019 and is reviewed with parents 
in quarterly  SART meetings.  The school safety plan is also reviewed and feedback is solicited by our local fire department.
  
Staff, parents and commun
ity 
members give input and recommendations for changes to the School Safety Plan annually to ensure a secure environment at our s
ite and other Clovis 
Unified School District (CUSD) campuses. Specific areas of focus, coupled with appropriate strategies to a
ddress concerns are featured in our school plan.

Community meetings to discuss best practices, share data and evaluate progress on our instructional focus. CUSD offers Beginn
ing Teacher Support and 
Assessment (BTSA) training for beginning teachers. This is a two
-
y
ear program targeted at five performance areas. Teachers and administration utilize 
the Illuminate Education data reporting system to monitor student achievement, identify areas for reteaching, and to formulat
e deployment groups for 
intervention and enrich
ment.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mast
ery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cu
ltural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://

Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
Scho
ol Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
