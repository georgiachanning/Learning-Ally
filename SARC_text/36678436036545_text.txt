By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As Principal of Mariposa Elementary School, I am pleased to p
resent to the community our School Accountability Report 
Card. Since November 1988, state law has required all public schools receiving state funding to prepare and distribute a 
School Accountability Report Card. The purpose of the report card is to provid
e parents and the community with important 
information about their public school. Mariposa Elementary, home of the Monarchs, is a positive school community 
composed of exceptional students, committed teachers, diligent classified employees, outstanding par
ents, and a devoted 
PTA. Our students are enthusiastic learners and we at Mariposa Elementary are continuously proud of their ongoing 
achievements including receiving California Distinguished School status in the spring of 2012. In the summer of 2013, 
Mari
posa was honored to receive PTO Today Magazine's "National Parent Group of the Year" award.  Over the last several 
years, Mariposa has also been a California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE) Honor Roll School.
 
 
Mission Statement: The staff of Marip
osa Elementary School, with the strong support and involvement of our parents and 
community, is committed to emphasizing academic and social achievement at the highest levels of excellence and to 
meeting the unique needs of all students with standards
-
base
d and visual and performing
-
arts oriented programs.
 
 
School Description: The school motto is: "Mariposa, Where Children Come First". The partnership between school, home, 
and the community is exceptional. We are indebted to the tremendous parental support 
that is a hallmark of our school. 
Annually, we average approximately 13,000 hours of volunteerism.
 
 
Our goal is to provide our students with the academic and social tools they need to become productive members of our 
society. Students are guided by our "Fi
ve Keys to Success" which is central to our character education program.
 
 
These Keys are as follows:
 
Pride: a job well done by putting forth their best effort at all times.
 
Contribution: the ability of students to think of others, contribute to the school,
 
the classroom and our community.
 
Responsibility: the ability to be trustworthy, do what is right, and accept the consequences when they make a poor choice.
 
Flexible Thinking: the ability to solve real problems on their own.
 
Organization: the ability to ge
t classwork and homework turned in on time, come to class prepared and to budget time 
wisely.
 
 
These essential elements of knowledge and character provide a basis for our educational practices. The collective result 
is a responsible and capable student bod
y. The Five Keys are taught by our staff in conjunction with our MindUp Character 
Education curriculum, which are reflected in our daily activities.  A different key is highlighted monthly and students are 
rewarded at Flag Ceremonies for exhibiting exempla
ry behaviors related to our Keys.
 
 
Mariposa School has a unique learning environment for all students. The campus is beautifully decorated with murals, 
gardens, and nature trails.  Thirty minutes before school begins, students and parents can hear music fr
om our current 
Composer of the Month.

Garden, connects science, social studies and mathematics to outdoor learning. This program is coordinated by parent 
volunteers.
 
 
To address the academic nee
ds of all students, the school utilizes a variety of interventions including universal access 
materials, computer
-
based instruction and individualized instruction. All teachers have been trained to use Thinking Maps 
strategies to enhance brain
-
based learni
ng.  In addition, all teachers have been trained on writing instruction via a program 
called Write from the Beginning.  Students with identified learning disabilities receive services through the Specialized 
Academic Instruction Program (SAI).  SAI utilize
s in
-
class or pull
-
out services from highly qualified certificated teachers and 
instructional paraprofessionals in the resource and special day classrooms.  The Speech, Language and Hearing (SLP) 
Program serves students with needs in articulation, language
, or other speech
-
related issues that are impacting learning. 
Approximately 4% of our students are English Language Learners (ELL) and are served by teachers trained in Cross
-
Cultural 
Language Acquisition Development (CLAD) and Specially Designed Academic 
Instruction in English (SDAIE). Mariposa's 
approximately 72 GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) students receive GATE instruction in
-
class; some additional 
enrichment activities are offered to GATE students as well. The majority of Mariposa's staff is tra

strategies for differentiation.
 
 
Fourth and fifth grade students have an opportunity to participate in Instrumental Music and Band programs weekly. 
There are several performances throughout the year on site and in our community. 
Likewise, students in 3rd
-
5th grades 
may join the Chorus. Students also perform at Flag Ceremonies with their classmates. All students have an opportunity to 
participate in at least one performance each year with their classroom.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Built in 1965, Mariposa Elementary School has 26 classrooms, a library, and a lab sp
ace. With an enrollment of 
approximately 532 students in grades TK
-
5, we find our school is near full capacity at almost all grades. The students, staff, 
and parents are very proud and take great pride in the appearance of our school. We have large murals 
painted throughout 
campus that reflect our culture and are continuing to paint more.  We also have two large maps of the United States on 
the blacktop. An efficient custodial staff and a special student program, Friendly Helpers, guarantee a litter free ca
mpus 
each day.  Our custodians work diligently each day and night to ensure our campus and classrooms remain clean and safe 
for all students, staff and parents.  Eagle Scout projects have beautified the campus over the years as well.  The staff at 
Mariposa
 
Elementary School and the Redlands Unified School District work diligently to maintain a safe, clean campus for 
students of our community to attend. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A 
summary of these standards i
s available at the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The 
principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. When 
maintenance and repairs are needed, the site cu
stodians are notified or work orders are submitted to the district's Service 
Center where district personnel are dispatched in a timely manner to make any necessary repairs.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mariposa is fortunate to have a
 
very active parent volunteer community. Our families and community come together to 
accomplish our mission and work to exceed our goals.  We actively work to facilitate parental involvement and awareness 
within Mariposa through the many formal and informa
l communications including, the marquee and weekly bulletin. 
Parents and community members are part of our strong classroom volunteer program. Active involvement includes 
classroom tutoring, facilitating our library program, helping out with many of our sp
ecial functions, Book Fair, Wee Share 
contribution program, Fall Festival, the PTA Reflections program, and a variety of other classroom and school
-
wide events. 
Our active PTA provides annual fundraisers, the "Fall Festival"  and the spring's "A
-
thon," whi
ch raise money for various 
school equipment, assemblies and field trips. Our School Site Council works with the principal to monitor the school plan 
and budgetary expenses, as well as, to provide input on curricular issues and school life matters. Our pare
nts have been 
known to volunteer over 13,000 hours in support of our students. Because of the strong support of our parents, we are 
able to provide extra enrichment activities, such as school assemblies, to our students.  Our Library runs almost full time 
because of parent volunteers. Our beautiful gardens are also supported by parent volunteers via the Garden Club they 
organize on a monthly basis. Students stay physically active because of the volunteer led "Run Club" which meets every 
Tuesday and Thursday
 
before school.  We also have the support of community members such as the University of 
Redlands, the Redlands Educational Partnership, and the Assistance League of Redlands. In 2013, we were named Parent 
Group of the year in PTO Today's national contest.
  
We have frequently been a CBEE Honor Roll School as well.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mariposa School utilizes data 
from its California Safe School Assessment, monthly Safety Inspection reports, discipline 
files, and suspension/expulsion reports to evaluate the current status of our school. A School Safety Plan is adopted in the 
fall of each school year and is reflectiv
e of the school's safety needs. Our SSC council which consists of parents and staff 
members reviewed and updated our plan on October 9, 2019.  Our staff annually reviews their roles and duties within the 
safety plan for the annual Great American Shake out 
which occurs annually in October.  The district wide drill this year 
was held on October 17, 2019. In addition, Mariposa holds monthly safety fire drills.  The school also annually practices a 
Lock Down drill as part of our safety program.

The key compone
nts of Mariposa's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline policies and procedures, 
dress code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, 
dangerous pupil notification, and
 
disaster response procedures. A Disaster Preparedness plan is reviewed annually and 
drills are performed monthly.
 
 
To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, teachers, and the administrator supervise the school grounds 
including the bus drop
-
off area, cafeteria, and playground. Signs are posted around campus for all visitors to check in at 
the front office and scan their drivers license into the Raptor system for increased safety.
 
 
The campus is supervised during the day by Campus Monitors.
 
 
After school, students walk to the bus loading area and a crossing guard ensures students cross the street safely. Teachers 
and a Campus Monitor  supervise the areas until all students have left the campus for home.  The principal assists with 
supervision 
after school as needed.
 
 
Mariposa has also created a school safety committee that consists of parents, staff members and the principal that meets 
once a month to continue to look at and discuss ways that we could continue to make our school a safer place f
or students, 
staff and visitors.

Redlands Unified School District's Educational Services Division assists professional development activities by arranging 
training for staff, parents, and school community members. The district sponsors training for professional growth and 
student care. Al
l district training is aligned with the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.
 
 
Recently our current focus for staff development at our Mariposa is focused on the Standards of Mathematical practice 
and how to effectively integrate those standard
s into the classroom on a daily basis.  This professional development 
consists of a full day of training for our entire staff as well as 3 partial days ongoing throughout the year.  Additionally,
 
we 
are focusing on instructional strategies that can be used
 
to integrate the ELA and Mathematics curriculum and standards.
 
Teachers have an opportunity to take part in six half day collaboration days to share ideas and collaborate on a given 
professional development topic ranging from data analysis, instructional 
strategies, district initiatives, etc. These minimum 
days allow staff to have more time to work together to align their curricular strategies within their grade levels as well as
 
across grade levels.  In addition to these six days, Mariposa teachers have f
requent opportunities to collaborate within 
grade level meetings where they focus on further data analysis and integration of the new Social Studies Curriculum.  We 
also hold regular staff meetings, and Leadership team meetings.  Mariposa teachers have fre
quent opportunities to 
collaborate, including Grade Level meetings, regular Staff meetings, and Leadership Team meetings.
 
 
Teachers also receive instructional assistance (as needed) and on
-
going support from the principal and the District.  Plans 
to suppor
t special needs students, teachers may also receive consultation from district special education staff or outside 
agencies, such as the SELPA.  The District centrally oversees new teacher training.  Training may also include IST or 504 
Training, Instructio
nal Strategies Training, and Classroom Management strategies.
