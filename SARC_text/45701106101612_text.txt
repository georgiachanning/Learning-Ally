Turtle Bay School Mission Statement: Turtle Bay School is dedicated to improving the lives of the 
students we serve. Our school exists to build positive and meaningful relationships with our 

 
stakeholders and surrounding community. Using what have been identified as the best 
instructional practices, engagement through technology and collaborative learning, and social 
curriculum, Turtle Bay School will continue to create meaningful experiences 
for our students and 
serve our community with passion and affection.
 
 
The school's Vision Statement is simply, "Relationships As A Bridge To Learning." Turtle Bay School 
has been named a National Showcase School for Capturing Kids' Hearts by the Flippen Gr
oup for 
three consecutive school years. Additionally, Turtle Bay School has been named a California Honor 
Roll School by the Campaign for Business and Education Excellence for the past three years.
 
 
Leadership is a key to our success, while the atmosphere 
is collaborative and positive. Our school 
collaborates together every Wednesday afternoon and share our expertise. We have developed 
grade level collaboration teams that use student data to shape instruction. Our School Site Council 
and Parent Faculty Club
 
(PFC) provide parents/guardians excellent opportunities for input and 
involvement. We also have a very active Teen Leadership in our Jr. High preparing all of our students 
for college and career readiness.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the District and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify our facilities needs over the next decade. To support the asses
sment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 millio
n facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed in 2018 the District has use
d 
the Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bond Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond the District is seeking any Stat
e Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assist with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and 
working order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program cal
led "Akita Box" is used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest prior
ity. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, the maintenance department 

 
 
Turtle Bay Elementary School was built in 1996 and is located at 1330 Arboretum 
Drive. It is a dramatic and well
-
landscaped facility, and we perform 
regular maintenance to keep the site like new . Each wing contains art, science, and cooking centers, and we have thirteen po
rtable classrooms. In 2016 
the parking area was expanded.  Re
-
roofed kitchen in 2017. The campus has perimeter fencing for safety and has recently added access control to the 
site for improved security.
 
 
The school is staffed with two day, and two night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Pr
incipal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows t

which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a
 
monthly basis the lead custodian uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Northern 
California Schools Insurance to evaluate the conditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the District Faci
lities Department who then does 
an an
nual evaluation for the site.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

As a professional learning community and a Capturing Kids' Hearts National Showcase School, we are proud of our ongoing tradi
tion of high parental and 
community involvement. Parents join our Parent Faculty Club (PFC), volu
nteer in classrooms, or chaperone our many student activities and field trips. 
Our School Site Council (SSC) allows for parental input in key areas of school
-
wide goals, planning, and budgeting. There is an open invitation for parents 
to participate in ord
er to help support our sports and music programs. We welcome parent assistance  in classroom and school activities. Our schoo
l's 
Activities Director uses parental and community support to help with our school's "Career Day" and "World Day" activities.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provid
es the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The maintenance department inspects playgrou
nd equipment monthly, and we review and modify our School Safety Plan yearly. The School Safety Plan 
establishes an orderly response to any emergency or danger. Students and teachers practice organized evacuation routines and 
other drills monthly. Our 
scho

building positive
 
relationships with students, as well as those BEST practices that help teachers model, recognize, and reward positive behavio

unsuccessful. We believe that the key to good student behavior is a meaningful curriculum and engaged students. Turtle Bay Sc

student recognition program and acknowledges appropriate student choices. We encourage
 
leadership, school involvement, risk taking, and 
responsibility because we know that when students discover their passions, school is more meaningful. Our school's Site Leade

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 
2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
State school
-
based funding is used for programs that are consistent with the district goals and priorities (ie, curriculum, After School P
rogram). Funds are 
used for Professional Development, classroom supplies, school
-
wide events, and intervention curricu
lum. Last year our Parent Faculty Club raised more 
than $20,000 through fundraising efforts that pay for a myriad of school initiatives, including the annual fee that allows ou
r school to partner with 
Redding's Turtle Bay Museum and Arboretum. Individual p
arents and businesses help meet school needs through contributions to our sports, academics 
and music programs. Our school also raised over $22,000 through the Ducky Derby fundraiser, which was the most by a school in
 
Shasta County. These 
funds help pay fo
r field trips, classroom supplies, books, and educational materials.
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional infor
mation about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, s
taffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations
 
is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
,
 
and the ability to print 
documents.
