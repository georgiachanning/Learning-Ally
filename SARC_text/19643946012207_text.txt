Principal's Message
 
I
 
would like to welcome you to Sumner Elementary School's annual School Accountability Report 
Card. In accordance with Proposition 98 and to fulfill state and federal disclosure requirements, 
every 
school in California is required to issue an annual School Accountability Report Card. Parents 
and community members will find valuable information about our academic achievement, 
professional staff, curricular programs, instructional materials, safety pro
cedures, classroom 
environment, and condition of facilities.
 
 
Sumner Elementary School provides a warm, stimulating environment where students are actively 
involved in learning academics and positive values. Students receive a California standards
-
based, 
c
hallenging curriculum from a dedicated and professional staff. Ongoing evaluation of student 
progress and achievement, in Professional Learning Communities (PLC), helps us refine the 
instructional program to meet the individual needs of students in order t
hat all students can 
achieve academic proficiency.
 
 
We have made a commitment to provide the best educational and technologically sound program 
possible for Sumner Elementary School's students. We welcome any suggestions or questions you 
may have about the
 
information contained in this report or about the school itself. Together, 
through our hard work and commitment, our students will be challenged to succeed.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Sumner Elementary School will provide challenging academic experiences that wil
l encourage each 
child to reach his/her full academic, social, emotional, and physical potential. Learning will occur in 
a safe and caring environment that fosters excitement, enthusiasm, and discovery. Students will be 
encouraged to appreciate their own w
orth and importance as well as that of others. Sumner 
Elementary School will provide an atmosphere that will enable each child to develop a respect for 
the differences of others and nurture a sense of responsibility to the community and the 
environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Sumner Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California State Sta
ndards. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
ba
sed materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials (English language arts, math, science, and social sc
ience).
 
 
On Thursday, October 17, 2019, the Claremo
nt Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution #06
-
2020 which certifies as required by Edu
cation 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home,
 
and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content of 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science
, history
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 
school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home. These materials com
plied with the stat
e's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. 
Sumner Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1963; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilit
ies remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance a
nd site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in 
good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs ar
e given the highest priority.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attent
ion prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. One day custodian and two evening custodian
s are assigned to Sumner Elementary School. The day custodian is responsible 
for:
 

 
Cafeteria setup/cleanup
 

 
General grounds maintenance
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
Trash removal

Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subs
equently cleaned as needed. The evening custodians are responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Common use area cleaning

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
