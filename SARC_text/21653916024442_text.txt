Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Old Mill School is one of six schools in the Mill Valley School District, which is comprised of five elementary schools and 
one middle school.
 
 
Old Mill School is situated in the fern and redwood canyons at the base of Mt. Tamalpais, named by th
e local indigenous 
Coast Miwok people. As the oldest elementary school in our community (2016 was our 95th anniversary year), we have a 
long and rich tradition that extends back through several generations of students.
 
 
Old Mill provides an excellent educa
tion for its students. In addition to the daily guidance provided by our homeroom 
teachers and support staff, we offer music, art, library, physical education, Spanish and dance classes. Old Mill is also a 
place where we care about others and our planet. W
e focus school
-
wide on the Old Mill Learner Profile, twelve character 
attributes, throughout the year to develop ourselves as global citizens. We also use mindfulness strategies in our 
classrooms weekly, implement "green" initiatives regularly, and encoura
ge students to take responsibility for their 
learning. Our students, staff, and parents find opportunities every year to help those in need and improve our local and 
global community.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and site leadership provide many opportunities for parent participation, such as 
annual school
-
wide day and evening events, volunteering in the classroom, supporting those in need locally and globally, 
and organizing oc
casional events such as guest speakers and assemblies.
 
 
Parents, community members, and local businesses support local schools through a parcel assessment and contributions 
to the district Kiddo! Foundation, which raises funds to augment a broad range of s
chool programs, including visual and 
performing arts, music, Spanish, technology and global studies. An entirely new campus opened in 2014 through 
community supported bond measures totaling $26,300,000.
 
 

cial Education PTA and parents are encouraged to get involved. It was 
formed in 2005 to support students with learning differences and their parents, but has since expanded its mission. ITAV 
provides information and resources to understand, identify and te
ach all students who learn differently.

scale district wide emergency drill involving students, staff, and volunteers as well as Mill Valley Fire Department and/or
