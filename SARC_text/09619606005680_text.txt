By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Pinewood Elementary is a small, rural school nestled on the we
stern slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains between 
Placerville and Lake Tahoe.  Pinewood, one of two schools in the Pollock Pines Elementary School District, serves students 
in transitional kindergarten through fourth grade with an enrollment of 340 studen
ts.
 
 
Pinewood Elementary School is committed to the success of each and every student. This school site consistently reflects 
on its growth on local and state priorities to continually move forward within the district. In recent years, we have 
implemented 
research
-
based programs that better address student needs and eliminated programs where data showed 
otherwise.  As the school looked to implement an improved approach to teaching and learning, we started with Robert 

 

-
rounded approach to student achievement starts 
with research
-
based, literacy and numeracy instructional practices that are implemented school
-
wide. To build upon our 
foundation training of Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI), ou
r district is currently starting to support teachers in implementing 
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) practices. Full implementation of UDL is expected to take several years. To ensure that 
the teachers adhere to the California Common Core  State Standa
rds, we partnered with West Ed to receive intensive 
training on the instructional shifts in both the the English Language Arts and Math standards. In addition, site professional
 
development has centered on understanding the content area frameworks. In our 
mission to develop technologically 
fluent learners, our staff has been trained to use the Google platform so that our many grade levels that are using on to 
one devices can enhance their adopted curriculum with digital experiences. With our goal to grow in
 
math, our staff has 
dedicated a great deal of time studying and implementing mathematical growth mindset norms, identifying research 
based strategies to develop math practices, and  began using the Smarter Balance Interim Assessment Blocks to measure 
stud
ent growth. In English Language Arts, we have read the EduProtocol book by Corippo and Hebern to enhance our 
work within the our recent Benchmark curriculum adoption. We continue our long standing commitment to using district 
wide approaches with Step
-
Up
-
t
o Writing strategies. This year our staff will delve formally into the Next Generation 
Science Standards not only to amplify science instructions, but also to reinforce both ELA and Math skills. Finally, as a Tit
le 
1 school we recognize the need to address
 
social emotional learning. Our staff has received extensive training on trauma 
informed practices, Love and Logic, and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports.
 
 
The success of our school begins with our entire team of dedicated and talented educato
rs. Given the small size of our 
teaching staff, we reflect on the data and performance to guide our professional growth plan. Significant initiatives are 
reported in the School Plan for Student Achievement with extensive action steps that guide our way. At
 
Pinewood 
Elementary School, the 
School Plan
 
is a true working document that is designed to hold each of us accountable on a day
-
to
-
day basis.  Data is paramount when it comes to making decisions and qualifying success at Pinewood.
 
 
Professional Learning C
ommunities play an integral role at Pinewood. Each Wednesday, is an early release day, dedicated 
to professional growth. At least twice per month, teachers meet in grade
-
level groups and fl to discuss student 
performance and follow the cycle of inquiry to 
improve our teaching practices.  In addition, each month the staff meets 
propel our learning of of initiatives outlined in our 
School Plan
. . It is also important to note that our parents and local 
community  play an integral part in the teaching and learn
ing at Pinewood Elementary School.  Our School Site Council 
(SSC) gives critical feedback on the subjects of safety and school climate.  Our active Parent Teacher Club (PTC) has two 
very important missions;  to raise money for enrichment activities like fi
eld trips and also to organize events that help 
create a sense of community around important subjects like literacy.  We have many community volunteers who regularly 
volunteer to support  our students.

Parents are encouraged and asked to visit and volunteer in classrooms as much as possible.  The Parent Teacher Club is 
very active in supporting students, families, and programs.  Many 
activities are coordinated during the year such as fund 
raisers to update technology in classrooms and social events like the Spring Luau.  Some are traditional and occur "every 
year,"  some are "new ideas"  and some are in response to opportunities and ne
eds that arise.  Pinewood's School Site 
Council also meets regularly; parents can be involved by serving as elected representatives or attending meetings and 
contributing to sponsored activities.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Pinewood Elementary School staff members make every effort to provide a safe, orderly, and disciplined campus 
atmosphere. Pinewood 
developed and utilizes a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system to maintain 
behavioral expectations. These ideals are explicitly taught, modeled and reinforced by all staff  on a continual basis. The 
school to home connection and cons
istent communication is essential to sustaining a safe and orderly campus. 
Appreciation, positive recognition, and self
-
esteem building practices are ingrained in the school culture. Positive behavior 
and student contributions to the school are recognized 
at assemblies during the school year.
 
 
The school's Emergency Operations Plan is reviewed every year during staff development days before school begins. The 
most recent review took place in August, 2019. Staff is updated on the plan and made aware of the i
mportant details in 
the plan. Pinewood Elementary School practices a "Lock Down Drill", "Fire Drill" and "Bus Evacuation" during the first week 
of the school year with all staff and students. Monthly evacuation emergency drills are conducted to keep studen
ts and 
staff attuned to safety procedures.  The Plan is regularly reviewed and revisions are considered after every major 
emergency.  Most recently we have partnered with the County Sheriff and the Office of Emergency Services to discuss 
best practices dur
ing emergency events on campus.
 
 
Beyond evacuation procedures, our staff continually receives training aimed at the health and safety of the Pinewood 
Community. Annually, many staff members are trained to administer CPR and first
-
aid. In addition to this t
raining, our 
coaching personnel complete classes on identifying and treating concussions. A school nurse works two days per week 
assisting office personnel, staff, students, and parents with health concerns. This nurse also provides an annual in
-
service 
to
 
review and teach specific health and safety protocols. A team of employees is Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) trained 
to safely manage disruptive and assaultive behaviors. Yard supervision is provided by teachers, paraprofessionals, and the 
principal be
fore and after school and at all passing periods, breaks, and lunch.
