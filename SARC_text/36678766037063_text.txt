By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Highland
-
Pacific Elementary School has 23 classrooms, a multipurpose room, and an administration office, providing 
ample space for instruction. The campus was built in 1957 and modernized in 2012. The facility str
ongly supports quality 
first teaching in the classrooms and language arts support  for struggling students through the learning center.
 
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, 

Mobile Maintenance Teams use the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California 

Operations Department. The most recent inspection took place on 3/13/19. Below is more specific information on the 
condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with an appropriate learning 
environment.
 
 
Safety
 
To ensure
 
student safety before, during and after the school day, rec aides, teachers, and administrators supervise the 
school grounds including the cafeteria, quad area, and athletic fields.  Signs are posted throughout the campus to indicate 
all visitors must rep
ort to and register in the administration office.  All staff and visitors wear appropriate identifying 
badges.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

are p

each site reports safety issues as they arise.  Maintenance and Operations make necessary repairs to ensure that all 
schools are clean
, safe, and functional.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority and work orders are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

s department works with the site principal or designee to develop cleaning runs 
for the site custodian(s). The site principal/designee then works with the site custodian(s) to ensure proper 
implementation of the cleaning runs to maintain a safe and clean s
chool.
 
 
School Facility Improvements
 
Each year the district uses state and local funds to maintain and improve school sites.  Planned improvements for this 
school for the 2019

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Uni
versity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district an
d each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each school provides multiple options for parents to participate in the educational process.  There are several 
opportunities for parents to be involved at Highland Pacific
 
Elementary School. Each month, the principal hosts a "Pastries 
with the Principal" meeting in order to provide parents and guardians with updated information about the school and to 
provide opportunities for parents/guardians to express areas that they wo
uld like to focus on. In addition, parents are 
encouraged to run for School Site Council (SSC), which meets once a month to track Title I spending expenditures and to 
provide input on important school issues like approving the school safety plan. In additi
on, parents/guardians are also 
encouraged to join the ELAC (English Language Advisory Council), which also meets once a month in order to provide 
important input on how the school supports English language learner students. Highland Pacific Elementary Scho
ol is also 
in the process of forming an AAPAC (African American Parent Advisory Council) which we hope to establish in 
January/February of 2020.
 
 
In addition to these formal opportunities for parent/guardian input, Highland Pacific offers family nights and
 
activities 
throughout the school year. Parent Volunteers are heavily encouraged whether it is to attend classroom field trips, or to 
spend time volunteering on campus in the classroom. in addition, the school is seeking to start a parent resource center 
t
o open during the 2020
-
2021 school year.
 
 
At the district level, parents can participate in the District Advisory Committee (DAC), District English Learners Advisory 
Committee (DELAC), District African American Advisory Council (DAAAC), and a variety of sh
ort
-
term, solution
-
oriented 
focus groups and advisory committees.  Additionally, a Family Resource Center is available from the hours of 8:00 AM 
-
4:30 PM.  Goals of the Family Resource Center include increased home/school communication, increased access to
 
district
-
level parent and family training opportunities, and increased access to family involvement resources for district schools.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted
 
and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, tea
chers, support staff, parents, and students (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPS
A, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty master
ing academic state and local content standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment th
e core instructional program and increase the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment,
 
and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to provide impor
tant services and 
instructional support that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improv
ement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
b
ased interventions that are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, base
d on a variety of data, including local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to iden
tify schools and student groups in need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
