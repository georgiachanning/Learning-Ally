By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
With a successful broad
-
based curriculum, Farragut Elementary enjoys continued support from its students, parents, staff, 
and the community at large. Farragut was opened
 
as a small neighborhood school and today serves over 570 students 
from diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds. The school is known to have an Arts and Technology focus. It has a strong 
visual arts program with a curriculum that follows the K 
-
 
5th VAPA s
tandards. There is a dedicated art room where an art 
specialist conducts the lesson. The music program consists of music appreciation classes for all students. Students TK
-
2 
also receive vocal music instruction from a dedicated music teacher. In addition, 
the fourth and fifth graders may choose 
to take band or orchestra classes once a week, and all third graders receive lessons in playing the recorder. We have two 
Bell Choirs, advanced and beginning, which are available as free before school classes to stud
ents in grades 3
-
5 and a 
school choir which is also available for free to all students in grades 1
-
5. In addition to visual arts and music, theatre arts, 
dance and media arts are weaved throughout each grade level through partnerships with local teaching a
rtists and 
community partners.
 
 
Our technology focus has been enhanced this year through our Makerspace classroom. In the Makerspace, the learning 
happens through making, tinkering, art and engineering real things based on an individual's interest. Student
s K
-
5 have 
opportunities to connect art, design, engineering, science, and technology in project
-
based challenges facilitated by the 
Makerspace teacher. In addition to the Makerspace, our computer lab serves all students. The lab was funded by parent 
donat
ions and through grants. In addition to the lab, we also have computers in every classroom. Students learn 
keyboarding skills, perform word processing tasks, use the Internet for research projects, take benchmark assessments 
online, and practice academic s
kills using the various web
-
based software. All classrooms have LCD projectors and 
document cameras that allow teachers to enhance their lesson presentation visually. These tools also afford teachers to 
incorporate video streaming to enrich students' exper
ience with the curriculum.
 
 
Farragut is proud to provide several family nights throughout the year to connect families and build community. Our 
annual Family Math Night highlights our CGI Math practices and provides parents with strategies to continue the 
learning 
at home through math games and activities the whole family can enjoy. Our Science Night engages families in STEM 
activities and challenges students to solve real
-
life questions they have about the world. In addition to these academic 
family nights
, Farragut hosts Family Game Night, BINGO night, Fall Festival, two Book Fairs, Choir, Bells, and Recorder 
concerts, International Night and much more to celebrate our community and diverse talents.
 
 
Several field trips are arranged annually for each grade
 
level and are funded by PTA. In addition, assemblies are also funded 
and arranged by PTA. With the support of the Fan Club, the school is able to provide an extensive, moderately priced after 
school enrichment program through FAAST. Tuition assistance is 
available if needed. The class offerings vary throughout 
the year; however, classes in the fields of science, the arts, sports, and computers are regularly available. Chess Tutors ha
s 
also been a regular after school class for many students.

Farragut is p
roud to have many students actively engaged in service of the community and their peers. The Student 
Council, composed of student representatives from grades 3 
-
 
5, meets twice a month and is the guiding force in organizing 
Community Service Projects. It i
s also responsible for monitoring the halls during lunch recess. The Buddy Reading Program 
pairs Kindergarten and Fifth Graders in a shared reading program. The 5th graders volunteer during their lunch recess 
once a week to read or listen to Kindergartners
 
read. This program teaches older students to be mentors to the young 
kids and it fosters friendships across grade levels. Finally, our School Families Program is another example of cross
-
age 
mentoring and relationship building. The students, ranging from 
Kindergarten 
-
 
Fifth Grade, are grouped as a family and 
meet w it h their adult leader each month to discuss various topics, share ideas, participate in activities, or perform schoo
l 
service based on the Fox PAWS Character Program. 
 
 
The professional and c
aring school staff work diligently to provide a positive learning environment that addresses the 
unique talents and strengths of all students. Everyone in Farragut is committed to building lifelong learners by creating a 
school atmosphere where:
 

 
All childr
en are supported and encouraged in their academic, social, physical, and emotional growth through a 
well
-
rounded educational program.
 

 
Students, parents, teachers, administrators, and support staff work together as partners in improving student 
achievement.
 

 
Students, parents, and staff members all share a true sense of caring and t rust, resulting in high morale and 
strong school spirit .

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or 
not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Opportunities for parental involvement are numerous through the good works of the PTA and The Farragut Fan Club.  It 
is an expectation at Farragut that each and every parent and teacher join PTA.  The PTA gives unwavering support to every 
aspect of the sch
ool program.

PTA is a wonderful way to be involved at Farragut School.  The organizations supports a host of amazing programs and 
activities at the site such as:
 
 
1.  It sponsors curricular field trips for all students and gives each teacher a voucher for
 
use in purchasing any classroom 
supplies necessary to support and enhance student learning. Several assemblies each year are made possible through the 
efforts of the PTA chairperson who finds and arranges special programs that covers a range of topics for
 
all the students 
to enjoy.
 
 
2.  The Home Reading Program which promotes love of reading and literacy for students in grades Kindergarten through 
Fifth Grade is also organized and supported by PTA.  Two book fairs each year are organized by parent coordina
tors and 
volunteers. With the money earned, they buy books for the school library and also donate books to the classroom libraries.
 
 
3.  The annual Fall Festival has grown in size and variety each year. It is a wonderful way to get involved and meet other 
parents early in the year.
 
 
4.  The annual Career Day is an opportunity for parents, grandparents, and community members to share their working 
experiences with the children.
 
 
5.  They hold family movie nights throughout the year in the cafetorium which is
 
equipped with a state of the art sound 
system and projection system purchased with grant money from the Culver City Educational Foundation.
 
 
6.  Other activities organized by PTA include school beautification, Box Tops for Education Program, End
-

-
ye
ar fifth 
grade activities, Gift Wrap Sales, Red Ribbon Week, Reflections Art Contest, School Photos, Science Fair, Monthly Teacher
-
Appreciation Celebration, and Year book.
 
 
The Farragut Fan Club has two main missions: support the Arts Program and enhance t
he school Technology. To raise 
funds for these two programs, parents are asked to make a direct donation to the Fan Club. The amount of $250 is 
suggested per child per year; donations of any amount are also appreciated.  These funds allow the school to pro
vide the 
children with so many enrichment activities through the arts and technology. Through Fan Club the school is able to 
support Music Appreciation Classes. The after school enrichment program, FAAST, offers a wide variety of classes including 
soccer, 
computers, dance, science, theatre, music, and visual arts.  Our state of the art Computer Lab was secured with a 
combination of parent donations and a major grant. Fan Club pays for both ST Math and Freckle,  the school's online 
enrichment and interventio
n program in math. The online subscriptions have also been made available to the students 
for access at home.  ArtWorks!, the school's largest annual fund raising event, takes place each spring. It is an excellent 
opportunity for new parents to work side b
y side with veteran parents and teachers in celebrating student art and much 
more.  An online auction has been a big part of this fundraising effort.  The ArtWorks involves two spectacular events: A 
Community Arts Day is held on a weekend and many artists 
from various fields are invited to showcase their talents and 
crafts for all members of the community to enjoy.  And on Gala night, the parents, invited guests, and teachers join in on 
the fun during live and silent auctions.
 
 
All parents have the opportun
ity to get involved in formal committees at the school through School Site Council, English 
Learner Advisory Council, District committees, and the Culver City Education Foundation. Parents and community 
members are seen as valued partners in the education 
process.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan was presented to the Board of Education 

essentially two components: School Climate (strategies to maintain a caring climate) and Physical Environment (attributes 

ual school plans; b) provided curricululm 
and training in Caring School Communities and training in the Olweus Anti
-
Bullying Program; c) updated the physical 
environment; and d) developed a strategic plan. Each site has an emergency plan with a clear set o
f procedures.
 
 
At Farragut Elementary, our students in Transitional Kindergarten through Fifth Grade participate in a Character 
Development Program called Fox PAWS. Students from all grades practice PAWS which stands for: Practice Effort, Act 
Responsibly, We Show Respect, and Show Self
-
Control. Students review these character traits through classroom meetings 
and school
-
wide assemblies and earn Fox PAW tickets schoolwide.  At school
-
wide assemblies and in classrooms, students 
practice Mindfulne
ss and engage in strategies to support the work they do academically and socially throughout the 
school.  Each month, students are recognized for their efforts in a monthly ticket drawing.
 
 
In addition to classroom discussions, students also practice their
 
PAWS character traits with their cross
-
grade Buddy 
Classrooms.  The students learn about fairness, kindness, caring, responsibility, trustworthiness, and citizenship. In 
addition, we participate in the PTA's Red Ribbon Week, an annual event which encourag
es children make healthy choices 
and to reject drugs, tobacco and other unhealthful things. We use Second Step, Caring School Community curriculum and 
Anti
-
bullying Prevention Program, Olweus, to set up school rules and expectations for student behavior.  
The rules and 
expectations are clear, consistent, safety
-
based, and enforced school wide. We encourage and promote student self
-
regulation and positive reinforcement whenever possible. Good citizenship and good sportsmanship are valued at 
Farragut Elementa
ry.

Professional Learning Communities to monitor student progress and develop interventions to engage students. In addition 
to within the classroom academic supports,
 
Farragut has an Intervention team that includes our Intervention Teacher, ELD 
coordinator, Instructional Coach, Special Education Teacher, adn intervention instructional assistants.  Farragut also has a

School Site Council and Leadership Teams study student achievement, analyze needs, and identify areas for staff 
development. These identified needs become the focus of professional development (PD) for the following year for an 
ongoing comprehensive staff development program. In addition to site PD the teachers are also provided district wide 
assistance on core curr
iculum, special needs students, differentiation, strategies for teaching English language learners, 
Second Step Social
-
emotional Curriculum, technology, paraprofessional training, and classroom management. As a site, 
we also continue to grow our instructio
nal practices and strategies to support all learners by visiting school sites and 
sharing best practices. Furthermore, professional development days have been used to train staff on effective 
instructional strategies and programs that improve student achie
vement. Throughout the year, different grade level teams 
attend PD at different sites where teachers received training on Reading and Writing Workshop, Next Generation Science 
Standards, Restorative Practice, and CGI Math. Recently, the entire district par
ticipated in Balanced Literacy PD with a 
focus on Guided Reading. Teachers also have the opportunity to continue their professional development in district hosted 
PD on running records, guided reading, Daily 5 and the Cafe model of ELA instruction. For the
 
past two years, the focus at 
Farragut is Balanced Literacy with teachers being provided with the opportunity to work with a Teaching and Learning 
Partner (TLP) to support them in their journey. Teachers are provided with extensive PD in ELA, ELD, and Comm
on Core 
standards alignment.
