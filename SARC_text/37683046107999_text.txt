exceptional school with a dedicated staff that strives to provide an outstanding education to each 
student, every day. Our commitment to supporting each student acade

the heart of our school. We also share a passion for developing good character and social 
awareness in our students. Our high quality instructional program is enhanced by the support of 
our PTA and parent volunteers, and we all w
ork together to support students and make every day 
a great day to learn at Mt. Woodson. Our school was honored with the California Distinguished

Association Golden Bell in 1999.
 
 
The team at Mt. Woodson is committed to educating all students to higher levels of academic 
performance in a safe, caring and healthy environment that promotes respect for self and others. 
We work to ensure that our stude

through any challenge. We believe it is our responsibility to prepare all students for career and 
college readiness, without exception. Our program includes an emphasis on academics for all 
student

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Ac
countability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Contro
l 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data repo
rted in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
distri
ct office.

Types of Services Funded
 
We believe all students can learn, and we recognize that all students learn and retain information in different ways. For stu
dents with differing learning 
styles or disabilities, RUSD has a wide variety of intervention programs. The District provides regul
ar education, categorical programs and additional 
educational opportunities designed to help all students meet or exceed grade
-
level standards and to prevent students from falling behind. Federal 
categorical and additional educational opportunities are fun
ded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was reauthorized in 2015 
as the Every Student Succeeds Act. These programs include, Title I (English Language Arts and Mathematics support); Title II 
(Improving Teacher Quality); 
Title III (supp
ort for English Language Acquisition and improving Family Engagement); Title IV (support for elementary music and PE and seco
ndary 
technology and vaping cessation). State funding provides supplemental dollars so the District can provide additional service 
to unduplicated count 
students, including foster youth, English language learners, homeless youth, and students of low income families. RUSD offers
 
a wide variety of alternative 
education programs and settings, including the Ramona Community Campus which h
ouses the Ramona Community Montessori School (TK
-
6) and Mt. 
Valley Academy (TK
-
12 School/Independent Study); Future Bound (7
-
12 off campus Independent Study); and Montecito Continuation High School (9
-
