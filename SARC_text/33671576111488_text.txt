School Description
 
Valley View Elementary School (VVES) is one of 2 elementary  schools (grades K 
-
 
6) within the 
Nuview Union School District, which is nestled in a 
low
-
lying valley in the western  region of 
Riverside county.  The school received its name upon opening in 1991, as a result of recognizing its 
spectacular views of the surrounding mountains (Lakeview, Juniper Flats, San Jacinto, San 
Bernardino, and Mt. Ba
ldy
-
Los Angeles ranges).  VVES has an enrollment of approximately 540 
students. The school mascot is the eagle and the school colors are royal blue, silver, and black.
 
 
Misson Statement:
 
The belief at Valley View Elementary School is that each child should
 
be provided with a safe, 
positive, and challenging learning environment.  We believe that each child should be given the 
opportunity to grow academically, socially, and emotionally, and that our job as staff members is 
to provide an environment that will 
ensure this growth.  We believe that all children should be 
challenged to do their personal best, and that our efforts should lead to the development of well
-
rounded students who will obtain skills that will make them successful adults and participate in a
 
democratic society.
 
 
Shared Vision:
 
We, the members of Valley View Elementary School, through shared decision
-
making, will create 
unique, memorable experiences and learning opportunities that will help develop responsible 
citizens and instill enthusiasm f
or life
-
long learning.
 
 
Learning: We believe that a quality program along with high parent and teacher expectations for 
student achievement is a major factor in all students reaching their full potential for academic 
success.  As educators, we will strive 
to be knowledgeable  and informed of the different learning 
styles of our students so that we might diligently incorporate these into our daily lessons.
 
Respect: We will provide a respectful environment for students, staff, and parents, which values 
our di
fferences, as well as our similarities.  We will educate our students to honor and respect the 
laws and customs of this land, as well as honoring and respecting all peoples and cultures as 
valuable and contributing members of a free society.
 
 
Community: We 
value a partnership among teachers, home, and community that works to provide 
all students with the rewards of a quality education that promotes life
-
long learning.  We will 
encourage and create a positive community school partnership in the effort to find
 
new and better 
ways to involve, inform, and educate all those interested in fostering a stronger community through 
the academic success of our students.
 
 
Communication: We believe that clear communication is the foundation for academic and social 
success i
n the classroom, school, and community.  Communication is a means to encourage and 
ensure that students meet the expectations established at Valley View Elementary School.  A 
positive and professional demeanor between parents and faculty, attained through 
trust, mutual 
support and teamwork, will further the attainment of these stated goals.  An ongoing openness 
between school and home will reinforce the success of our students and make a positive impact in 
our community.
 
 
Accountability: We believe as educat
ors we are entrusted with the responsibility to educate and 
empower this generation of students, which in turn, impacts future generations as well.  We will 
work to ensure academic success for all students by establishing high expectations for student 
perf
ormance, clear and measurable goals, and frequently monitoring student progress.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Ava
ilability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on October 10, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had suffici
ent and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, o
r science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use i
n the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by 
the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoptio
n.
 
 
The table displays information collected in September

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Valley View Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. School facilities were 
built in 1993 and span 42,986 
square feet. The school encompasses 10 acres of land and 
includes 23 permanent classrooms, 12 portable classrooms, a library, a computer lab, a 
multipurpose room, and administrative offices. The campus also features a wide array of recreational and sports areas, includ
ing playground equipment, 
a basketball court
, and grass and blacktop play areas. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and pla
yground 
space, and a staff resource room.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all sch
ools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school office 
or at the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to
 
ensure a clean and safe school. 
Valley View E
lementary School has two full
-
time custodians to provide janitorial and maintenance services on campus.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
The district administers a scheduled maintenance program, including regular facilities inspections, to ensure that all classr
oom
s and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good repair. When necessary, the district takes appropriate actions to ensure campus facilities are in good
 
working order and provide 
a clean and safe environment for all members of the school community. A work o
rder process immediately alerts district personnel of any maintenance 
needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the highest priority. At the time this report was published, 10
0% percent of restrooms 
on campus were in good working order.
 
The facility chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection provided by the district.

school to ensure the safety of all our students.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at
 

student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire drills are conducted monthly, lockdown drills quarterly  and evacuation dril
ls are conducted annually.
 
 
The
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed in 1999 by the district in cooperation with local law enforcement in order to 
comply with Senate 
Bill 187 of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environmen
t. Components of the Comprehensive 
School Safety Plan include the following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedur
es, disaster response 
procedures, procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school, sex
ual harassment policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and 
discipline policies. The plan is updated annually in the spring and shared with school staff throughout the school year. A co
py of the plan is available to 
the public at the district
 
office.  The plan was last updated and reviewed with faculty in October  of 2019.
