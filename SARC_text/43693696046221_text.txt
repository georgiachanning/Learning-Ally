School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our mission is to inspire and prepare our students to achieve their fullest potential, throu
gh a blended curriculum, 
integrating art, technology and academics. We believe all students can learn, and are capable of being creative and 
innovative for success in college and careers. We strive to develop our students into confident and caring citizens
, with 
strong ethical values. We aim to foster a sense of inclusiveness and community among our students, staff and parents.
 
 
Lyndale Elementary School is the hidden gem of the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District.  It is a beautiful and 
spacious cam
pus where we offer our students an educational program that teaches Common Core standards.  We pride 
ourselves on a strong academic program that includes music, art, and theatre.  Teachers, parents, and students work 
together to create a rigorous and engag
ing learning environment.  Our focus is on all children being redesignated on CELDT 
by the time they reach fifth grade.  We incorporate backwards planning and language supports so our students will score 
at or above grade level on all assessments and show 
yearly improvement on the Smarter Balance Assessment.
 
 
We have a positive school climate by believing in a Growth Mindset, incorporating PBIS, and the Lions Laws to Live By.  
We believe in "Living Responsibly, Kindly, and Safely."  At Lyndale, we BELIEVE i
n each other and our ability to come to 
school each day and achieve excellence.  We INSPIRE each other to learn and to grow as scholars and future leaders.  We 
RESPECT each other, our school, our world, and ourselves.  We CREATE a school that is peaceful, 
welcoming, and gives all 
of us a chance to make the world a better place.  We are dedicated in helping all our children succeed.

s given in grades three

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Lyndale we provide many 
opportunities for parents to participate and be an integral part of our school community. We 
regularly provide information on school and school district policies and procedures. We survey families to determine 
needs, interests, and ideas around parenting a
nd how to include and involve our parents and families. Parents are cordially 
invited during Back
-
to
-
School Nights, Open Houses, Autumn Festivals, Math/Science Nights, Literacy Nights, Walkathons 
and other fun
-
raising events. During our Open House towards 
the end of the academic year, we host Art Shows and 
performances by our Mariachi band and choirs. At Lyndale, we have a long standing tradition of parents coming to school 
for lunch with their students.  On rainy days, tables are set aside for parents in t
he cafeteria. Parents are involved in School 
Site Council, ELAC, and Parent Coffees. We also have parent Coffee for our parents with students in our three preschool 
classes and one TK/Kinder class for children with autism.  Lyndale parents actively support
 
school wide activities and 
chaperone field trips. We have several parents attending DELAC and DAC meetings at the district. We also encourage 
parents to participate in Parent Universities. A newsletter in English and Spanish is sent home one to two times 
a month 
and we have frequent updates via parent link. Lyndale is part of the Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) cluster and we are 
part of two art showcases a year. We take pride in having an office that is always welcoming and open to parents. Our 
communit
y liaison works diligently to involve parents in school activities and in district activities.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Lyndale's primary areas of focus for staff development for 2019/2020 is on Positive School Culture and Math. We want to 
implement PBIS school wide, and want 50% of our students to be at or above grade level on iReady Math( diagnostics) at 
the end of the ye
ar.  We want our third, fourth, and fifth graders to gain 10% on the SBAC. We want to re
-
designate our 
EL students before the end of fourth grade.
 
 
Teachers are supported through grade level collaborations and district meetings. We have several staff profe
ssional 
developments on PBIS, math and science presented during faculty meetings through out the year. We have scheduled 
release days for all our teachers to provide extra planning time and reflect on test scores. The staff development plan is 
coordinated 
by the district Curriculum and Instruction Department in accordance with district and site priorities. Staff 
development days at the beginning of the school year are used to inform teachers about biases, inclusion, the math shifts 
and instructional focus, 
and sharing of best practices.
 
 
Teachers throughout the district are provided with opportunities to develop and expand their knowledge and skills. 
Through in
-
house training and countywide conferences, teachers are encouraged to attend in
-
services that 
promote best 
practice strategies in positive discipline, literacy and mathematics. Several trainings were offered to teachers during the 
summer through the district.
