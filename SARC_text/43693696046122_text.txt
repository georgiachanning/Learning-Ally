By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In partnership with parents and the community, Ben Painter Element

their potential as whole and unique individuals through the following:focusing on communication, collaboration, 
creativity, critical thinking, the meaningful use of technology, rigorous learning opportun
ities, and support of English 
Language Learners. This will enable our students to become productive, responsible 21st century thinkers. Ben Painter 
inspires creativity and lifelong learning, which will prepare our students for successful careers.
 
 
Painter 
provides School Linked Services (SLS) for all Painter families. SLS offers on
-
site school
-
based services to heal and 
strengthen individuals, families and systems by addressing needs and risks faced by children, youth, and families. Painter 
has continued it
s partnership with Think Together, which is comprised of 6 lead members and 1 supervisor who provide 
student support from 11:40am to 6:00pm each school day for students in Kindergarten through 5th grade. Students 
receive a healthy snack before participatin
g in a rotation of structured activities. Think Together's standards
-
based 
curriculum intentionally aligns, engages and reinforces learning concepts taught during the core day instruction which in 
turn, positively impacts student achievement.  Furthermore,
 
we believe our programs can have an even broader impact 
beyond academic achievement in that we help to prepare students to be successful in college or careers after they 
graduate high school.
 
 
In addition, Painter has partnered with our after school provi
der Think Together to provide us with a coach who offers 
recess, lunchtime and physical education activities for all students, and a before school recess for all students who arrive 
early. The Painter team strongly believes that parents are very important 
members of the school community. As a result, 

effective we can be, we need to work together to create a positive learning environment f
or all our students. Therefore, 
we encourage you to become active and informed. This may be done by attending meetings of the School Site Council or 
the English Learners Advisory Committee, volunteering to assist in the classroom, attending as many school 
programs and 


parti
cipation program and will be working with all families to assist them in completing 30 hours of parent participation 
hours.
 
 
Education is a partnership between home and school and thus, communication between parents and staff is essential. 
Please visit our
 
website which is designed to provide you with helpful information about our school.
 
Thank you in advance for your support. We welcome your suggestions, and we will solicit your help throughout the school 
year. If you need additional information or assista
nce, please do not hesitate to contact us at (408) 928

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Califor
nia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate 
achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for ent
