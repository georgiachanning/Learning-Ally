School Description
 
The Fulton & Alsbury Academy of Arts and Engineering opened in August 2016 as the newest middle 
school in the Lancaster School District, serving 420 students in 
sixth through eighth grade.  The 


after leading our robotics te
am to the VEX World Championships in Louisville, KY, one of our 
students was hired to co
-
host the Mythbusters Jr. television show with Adam Savage of the original 
Mythbusters series.
 
 
Every student takes an engineering course and an art course for all thre
e years of the program.  In 
engineering, students apply math and science content, expressing their creativity and using 
technology to solve real world problems.  For example, students build wind turbines and measure 
power output with multimeters to determi
ne an optimal blade design.  Students learn about simple 
machines and then use gears and motors to build a basic robot.  On high end laptops, students 
apply 3D modeling skills to build a playground of their own design.  Launching Estes model rockets, 
solde
ring circuits, and building a simple DC motor are other examples of the types of activities in 
which all students participate.
 
 
In the art class, students learn the principles of art and elements of design.  They study line, shape, 
color, form, texture, rh
ythm, and balance in compositions, and they will learn basic sketching 
techniques including shading.  In the second year of the program, still under development, 
Photoshop and video editing will allow students to learn ways to effectively share their ideas
 
with 
the world.  Our third year art program has yet to be determined, but it will continue to focus on the 
visual arts. The focus is on learning techniques that allow students to become comfortable and 
confident as beginning artists.
 
 
Our popular after sc
hool clubs include robotics, Science Olympiad, and Dance Force ballroom 
dancing, and the Youth Environmental Leadership Conference.  Students engage in community 
partnerships, including presenting a float at the Lancaster Christmas Parade.  Students submit
ted 
a design proposal for the new Medal of Honor display at the Air Force Flight Test Museum and met 
with the fabricator who will build the winning display.  Field trips both within our community and 
in the greater Los Angeles area help students understand
 
more about the world around them, from 
the F
-
35 assembly line at Northrop Grumman to NASA Armstrong to the Lancaster Performing Arts 
Center.
 
 
While the program is challenging, it provides a real world context as to how what they learn is used 
in a variety

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the L
os Angeles County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district offic
e.
 
 
School Buildings
 
Fulton & Alsbury Academy was founded in 2016 on a campus that was constructed in 1989.  Modernization begin du
ring the 2015
-
16 school year. The 
school is made up of individual relocatable buildings, an office, cafeteria/kitchen, staff lounge/workroom, library/media cen
ter, a makerspace, and 12 
classrooms.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Sched
ule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the district office. 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a 
clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
New School Construction
 
A classroom was converted for use as a STEM classroom.  Enhancements to the cafet
eria data, visual, and data systems were completed in 2019. A 
marquee was installed in 2019.

Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

There are many ways to get involved at Fulton & Alsbury!  For those wanting to volunteer in a classroom, please contact the t
eacher first to see how you 
might help.  We can also use volunteers in our libra
ry and in our after school robotics club.  Please see the office for more information on these 

 
for fingerprinting and the TB 
test,
 
as all of our regular volunteers are screened for student safety.
 
 
Our School Site Council is a way to help shape the school goals and to ensure that expenditures match that focus.  You can co
ntact Dr. Glatfelter, the 
principal, for more information.
 
 
We 
do not yet have a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) at Fulton & Alsbury, but please see the office if you have interest in get
ting one started!
 
 
Thanks to all our volunteers!
