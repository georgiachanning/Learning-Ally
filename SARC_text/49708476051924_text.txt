School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Old Adobe is a caring community serving students in grades TK
-
6th grade.  We are a small school with a big heart. Our 
program integrates creativity, environmental awareness and a social
-
emotional focus with rich and rigorous academi
cs.  
Students become leaders in their own learning through a wide variety of experiences in art, music, performance, 
gardening, physical education, reading, field trips, and much more. Parents and families are an active part of Old Adobe 
and a strong partn
ership between home and school is valued and encouraged. Together we grow kind, responsible lifelong 

 
 

e and engage the students while providing 
many ways for them to demonstrate what they are learning. Creative expression develops a myriad of competencies while 


natural systems and our interconnectedness with the natural world and each other. Science is brought to life through 
regular work in our edible garden, where the children learn valuable lessons about caring for our planet, nutrition, an
d 
the rewarding results of careful planning and hard work. Field trips, guest speakers and hands
-
on lessons in the classroom 
deepen their appreciation and caring for our environment.
 
 
At Old Adobe we teach the California state standards using carefully sel
ected district adopted curriculum along with the 
arts and ecology focus outlined in our charter.  Students set personal goals for academic growth and are supported 
enthusiastically in reaching them.  Technology is integrated into the school day for individ
ualizing learning, researching, 
developing presentations, and many other purposes. Our goal is to offer a well
-
rounded, challenging, arts
-
infused 
curriculum that gives children a strong academic foundation and the interpersonal skills needed for success fa
r beyond 
their time with us here at Old Adobe.   We take great pride in preparing children for the rest of their lives.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Old Adobe 
Elementary School has many opportunities for parental and family involvement in the education of their 
children. We have a very active Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) that raises funds for many school activities and enriches 
many of the experiences child
ren have in the school.  Parents join this group and establish partnerships with school staff 
in every meaningful endeavor in the school. Parents are also welcome to volunteer in classrooms and throughout the 
school.  Parents are in classrooms daily, help 
in the library, volunteer in the garden or on school projects, go on field trips, 
and help in community giving projects.  Parents enrich our school in many ways and work as partners in the education of 
our students.
 
 
We will find a way for you to become in
volved that matches your passions, skills, and your interests. Parents are also 
involved in parent conferences with the child's teacher and through regular contacts between the school and families.  
This happens through email and voice messages from the pr
incipal, the school Facebook page and social media, teacher 
communication sent via email, the school web page, our Old Adobe newsletter, and written notices sent home.  Families, 
students, and staff all work to make Old Adobe a welcoming place for everyone
.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Safety Plan for Old Adobe School is revisited each year, at least once.  Our plan was reviewed on September 18th, 
2019.  It will also be reviewed on February 12th, 2020.
 
 
Our safety plan outlines the procedures for various drills and emergencies includ
ing, fire, earthquake, intruder, and 
evacuation.  These drills are practiced monthly.
 
 
Our safety plan also includes staff responsibilities in the event of a prolonged emergency and roles each will play in the 
event of a school
-
wide disaster or a disaster 
in the community.  We have worked with the Redwood Empire Insurance 
group in disaster planning and establishing roles in the event of a disaster.  Our safety plan also includes procedures for 
parents including how to get their children from the school in a
n orderly manner that ensures we know where every child 
is.
