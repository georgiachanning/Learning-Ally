By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
The faculty and staff at Bla
nche Sprentz Elementary School (BSE) believe that a child's education is a responsibility shared 
by school, students, family and community. Our mission is to promote individual growth, academic achievement, and 
creativity for all students through positive 
school climate involving cooperation and communication among students, staff, 
parents, and the community. Our vision is to prepare all students to become responsible citizens and productive members 
of a culturally diverse society. Blanche Sprentz students 
are provided with an environment that is safe, kind, respectful 
and educationally inspiring. Our school climate encourages openness, trust, self
-
esteem, self
-
determination, and respect 
for self and others. We provide ongoing opportunities for learning and 
continuously focus on student achievement. We 
recognize and stimulate special talents in all students.
 
 
Language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, technology, physical education and the fine arts are included in our 
district adopted curriculum. A
ll subjects are taught in the context of meaningful learning experiences that take advantage 
of children's natural curiosity. Learning in the classroom is reinforced with homework assignments that students can 
complete independently. Special services are p
rovided by a psychologist, speech pathologist, nurse, nurse assistant/health 
clerk, resource specialist, self
-
contained special education teacher, and library clerk. Students have access to a well
-
equipped Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (S
TEAM) lab to enrich learning and increase exposure to science 
and technology.

Blanche Sprentz Elementary School provides a challenging curriculum, while allowing students to explore and develop 
their interests and talents. All students are assessed formally throughout the year and ongoing assessments guide the 
development of appropriate interventions and enrichment programs to meet the needs of each student.We hold student 
study team (SST) meetings  for students as needed, based on parent and/or teacher requests. We assess students for 504 
plans and special educ
ation services when needs are suspected and/or identified. Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) 
students are clustered in fourth and fifth grades, and conferences are held between the parent/guardian and teacher to 
discuss differentiated instruction to mee
t their child's needs. Systematic Instruction in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, 
and Sight Words (SIPPS) is taught school
-
wide from kindergarten through second grade, with some SIPPS instruction 
continuing into third grade for students who need additional
 
support. Our English learners (EL)  receive assistance from a 
bilingual instructional assistant (BIA).
 
 
Blanche Sprentz maintains a positive school environment through teamwork and the efforts of our staff, students and 
parents. Our hardworking school sta
ff is expected to model the behavior we expect from our students. We expect our 
staff and students to be Respectful, On
-
time, Courageous, and Kind (ROCK).We have a school social worker at our site four 
days per week, as well as Positive Behavior Interventi
ons and Supports (PBIS) based upon clearly defined standards of 
student behavior, consequences and rewards.  Before and after school care is provided by our Student Care Center and 
Folsom STARS. During all school activities, including extracurricular, emph
asis is placed on developing personal 
responsibility and a social conscience. We teach students to support one another's social, intellectual and emotional 
growth.  We offer a variety of extra
-
curricular activities including student council, Young Rembrand
ts, Edventure More 
(EDMO) Science, chorus, and extended
-
day interventions. Our strong Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) enhances 
positive parent/teacher/principal interactions and cooperation, provides a calendar full of fun activities for students, and 
su
pports the school site and facilities.
 
 
Blanche Sprentz families consistently and repeatedly express the desire to be involved in their children's education. We 
encourage a productive partnership between home and school. We also value community partnership
s. Our PTO is 
extremely active, providing many activities and events for the students and families of Blanche Sprentz. The school 
expends considerable time and resources establishing strong connections to our families and community through our 
School Site 
Council (SSC), parent engagement activities, Coffee & Conversation with the Principal, as well as multiple 
volunteer opportunities. Our Blackboard Connect messages (voice, email, and text), school marquee, and school webpage 
keep families informed about sc
hedules, events and activities happening at school. Frequent communication, regular 
conferences, and parent involvement in the classroom all help to build a positive learning environment.We collaborate 
with community partners including the PC Pals/Intel pr
ogram, Oak Hills Church (for a community service day) Folsom's 
Hope, Kaiser Permanente, Micron Corporation, Sacramento Rivercats, Folsom Parks and Recreation, Folsom Rotary Club, 
Folsom Lions Club, and Folsom Police and Fire Departments. Many parents are f
requent and active volunteers in the 
classroom. Our strong and energized PTO further enhances positive parent/teacher/principal interactions and 
cooperation. Our PTO meets twice monthly and they play a key role at Blanche Sprentz. They provide supplemental
 
instructional materials for each classroom, fund classroom field trips and provide funding for after school clubs. In 
addition, they sponsor a variety of school wide activities for Blanche Sprentz students and families.

2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equip
ment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards

aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and
 
to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed b
y all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

g peer pressure.
