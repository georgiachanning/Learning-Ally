Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Oro Grande Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and 
volunteers. School facilities 
were built in 1947 with two other wings added in 1952, 1957 and modernized in 1992. A Multi
-
Purpose Building was built 
in 1996. Facilities are situated on 10 acres and encompass 24,850 square feet. They include eight permanent
 
classrooms, 
35 portable classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room/gymnasium, piano lab, two playgrounds, staff rooms, and administrative 
offices, including EL and Speech. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and 
playgrou
nd space.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance staff are proactive and 
conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good
 
repair and working 
order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority. The district maintenance staff has indicated that 100% of all toilets on school 
grounds 
are in working order.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A custodial staff ensures that all classrooms and facilities are in good working order. Classrooms are serviced each evening.
 
A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at 
the district office. The site administration team works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program,
 
which provides matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, inter
ior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

lunch, recesses, and before and after school, 
proctors, teachers, and administrators supervise students and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to 
ensure a safe and orderly environment.The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed b
y the district to comply with 
Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: curr
ent status of 
school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to 
suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe 
ingress 
and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and 
procedures.  The school evaluates the safety plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including 
elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are reviewed with school and district staff in the fall at the start of each school year. The 
School Site Council along with a school safety committee reviews the plan annually and the board if trustees approves the 
plan on or before March 1.  The lates
t revisions to the Safe School Plan was the 2018
