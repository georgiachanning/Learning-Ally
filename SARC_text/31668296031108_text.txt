About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2018
-
19)
 
All core curriculum materials have been reviewed for alignment with the California Content Standards (Common Core State Stand
ards) and Next 
Generation Science Standards, 
adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE).  These materials have been evaluated, piloted, and selected by a 
committee of teachers, and subsequently adopted by our governing board.  All students receive the appropriate and necessary c
urriculum and 
suppl
ementary materials.  Permanent books are loaned to students each year and collected at the end of the year.  Consumable mater
ials are provided 
to each and every student to support classroom instruction.  For digital curriculum components, students without 
devices are allowed to loan a device 
for access at home.
 
 
Teachers may, according to need, augment these materials with activities, materials, web
-
based resources and utilize instructional strategies they have 
learned in workshops or curriculum classes.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

Together, parents play a very important role in Greenhills School through their participation in our school's success.
 
As a formal group, the Greenhills School Site Council is a guiding 
force in deciding policy and procedures for school advancement.  Our Site Council is 
comprised of equal parts of Parent representatives and Teacher representatives.  The Site Council meets monthly and all meeti
ngs are posted and open 
to the public.  On a r
egular basis staff present reports on curriculum, assessments, and other current issues.
 
Our Parent
-
Teacher Club consists of 55 officers and the membership includes all parents in our school.  Our PTC takes an active role in 
fundraising at our 
school.  PTC
 
runs and provides financial support for special events such as Author Day, Field Day, Harvest Feast, etc.  Parents are encour
aged to volunteer 
in the classroom on a regular basis and are welcomed to participate during singular events.
 
As classroom volunte
ers, our parents serve as art, science and garden docents as well as in providing everything from assistance in working with 
small 
groups to clerical support.
 
Multiple avenues for school engagement are utilized by the school for all parents, with 
particular attention devoted to increasing parent engagement for 
socio
-
economically disadvantaged students, English learners, and students with disabilities.

Types of Services Funded
 
Eureka Union School District is guided by its mission of "Working Together for Excellence 
-
 
Every Student, Every School, Every Day" and hence, its budget 
in 
focused on supporting high
-
quality instruction in the classroom.  The classroom is protected from funding cuts as much as possible to maintain EUSDs 
high academic performance. In a study conducted, the Eureka Union School District was found to have the hig
hest percentage of budget dollars 
concentrated in the classroom (teachers, aides, materials, equipment) relative to other districts in the region.  EUSD also b
elieves in the education of the 
whole child, and its budget reflects this commitment.  Several pr
ograms exist to support and promote socioemotional development and positive 
behavioral outcomes.  EUSD has the highest counselor to student ratio in the region.
 
 
For struggling and at
-
risk students, academic intervention support is available at all sites. 
 
Students and teaching staff also have access to technology to 
help make teaching and learning more effective.  There are instructional aides available for  providing direct support, wheth
er push
-
in or pull
-
out, to 
struggling students.  The district coordi
nates and provides support to programs that serve students representing different populations: SpEd, GATE, and 
EL. Each school site provides unique programs and resources based on identified needs.

g English learners).

of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
