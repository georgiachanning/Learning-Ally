Principal's Message
 
 
Welcome to Arroyo School! Our team of teachers, staff, parents and administration have worked 
hard to create a wonderful learning experienc
e that highlights the SCSD Habits of Mind for 21st 
Century Learners (Ownership, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity, Critical Thinking and 
Citizenship/Stewardship) and deeper learning through PBL (Project Based Learning). We have 
designed a school tha
t will encourage and support risk taking, play and the pursuit of individual 
passions, while fostering intrinsic motivation to learn and discover the world around us. We have 
also developed ways to extend the learning beyond the classroom walls through str
ong elective 
and enrichment programs including music, art, maker space, and garden, along with robust after 
school offerings and flexible learning environments to best meet all of our students' needs. We 
encourage student leadership through our Eagle Counc
il, student
-
led clubs and ambassador 
program. We are very excited to welcome students and families to our wonderful school!
 
 
Mindy Shelton, Principal
 
 
Arroyo School Mission Statement
 
 
The mission of Arroyo School is to inspire our 21st Century learners to 
achieve their highest 
academic, social, emotional, intellectual and physical potential, while developing a strong sense of 
character, community, and stewardship. We aspire to amplify each child's natural curiosity and love 
of learning so they can become ca
ring and enthusiastic lifelong learners.

We believe:
 

 
Project Based Learning (PBL) experiences, developed from Common Core State Standards (CCSS), promote learning through 
authentic experiences that encourage critical thinking,
 
collaboration, communication, and social responsibility.
 

 
Personalized learning, designed to adapt to student learning styles and academic needs, can ignite student passions while 
leading to targeted student growth and
 

learning.
 

 
Small teams of 4th and 5th grade classes cultivate a safe environment for individual
 
learning and self
-
discovery, while also 
building a deep sense of belonging.
 

 
High expectations for character and behavior create a school culture exemplified by
 
p
hysical and emotional safety, integrity, 
compassion, and respect.
 

 
Shared school traditions and celebrations support personal growth, collaboration, and
 
a strong sense of school community.
 

 
Multiple means of assessment, including portfolios and 
student
-
led conferences, along with academic reports, hold students 
accountable for the highest quality of
 
work.
 

 
Multicultural and world language studies instill tolerance and broad world views while
 
fostering an appreciation for local and 
global diversity
.
 

 
Physical fitness, outdoor activities, and visual and performing arts are an integral part
 

 
 
Across the school day our students will:
 

 
strengthen their collaboration skills
 

 
take personal risks (that do not endanger anyone)
 

 
participate in a variety of activities and projects
 

 
learn to communicate effectively and resolve conflicts peacefully
 

 
strengthen their questioning, conversation and argumentation skills
 

 
share their findings in evidence
-
based ways
 

 
deepen their understanding
 
of what it takes to become well
-
rounded citizens and stewards of our environment
 

 
listen to and speaks kindly to others
 

 
look for ways to include and help others
 

 
celebrate differences
 

 
work toward their personal best, socially and academically
 
 
We welcome yo
u to visit our school. It is a special space because of the strong teaching staff, supportive parent community and engaged 
student body.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.c
a.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education and in alignment with the development of
 
State Standards an
d 
Frameworks, making the textbooks and materials used in the school the most currently available. As part of the adoption proce
ss, materials are piloted 
and selected by a selection committee composed primarily of teachers and including other staff as neces
sary. When materials are being recommended 
for adoption, they are made available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption and/or parents are invi
ted to provide input via other 
means. Recommendations from the committee are then brough
t to the Board for adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Arroyo Upper Elementary School campus opened as a Grades 4
-
5 school for the 2017
-
18 school year, and shares a plot of land with Central Middle 
School.  A portion of Arroyo School's classrooms were formerly part of Central Middle School. Those classroom
s and the school office were remodeled 
from 2015
-
2017. In addition to those classrooms being remodeled, a new building was constructed containing six classrooms, two smaller 
breakout 
rooms, and a large Learning Commons. Additional student and staff bathroo
ms are also housed in the new building. Many of the classrooms are 
connected by movable walls or double doors, which allows for flexible learning spaces and cross curricular learning activitie
s.  All classrooms contain 
large screen monitors with Apple TVs 
for projections and a cart of Chromebooks available for student use.
 
 
The Fine Arts Building, shared with Central Middle School, underwent a full remodel and was reopened during the 2015
-

houses the band room, orchestra room an
d library. Cafeteria facilities are located in the original Central Middle School Building, now named Mustang 
Hall. Outdoor spaces consist of a play structure, school garden, "wild zone," as well as a blacktop and large grass field, wh
ich is shared with Ce
ntral Middle 
School.

math centers, activity centers
 

 
Fieldwork: driving, chaperoning, preparing(making calls, gathering materials)
 

 

 
knowledge, craft skills, etc.) at school
 

 
PTA (Parent 
Teacher Association): getting involved and helping with events,
 
fundraising, communication and more
 

 
School Site Council (SSC) Participating on the SSC to help identify and monitor goals for the school.
 

 
Library: organizing materials, re
-
shelving books, supp
orting library time
 

 
School Day: yard duty/supervision, caring for garden plants, organizing
 
materials/play equipment, supporting hot lunch program
 

 

 

 
Helping to supervise and support our stude
nt
-
led clubs
 

 
Garden: Teaching a monthly gardening lesson or assisting in the garden.
 

 
Art in Action: Facilitating a monthly art lesson or assisting with the lesson

School Safety Plan
 
School Safety Plan:
 
Safety of students is a primary concern of Arroyo Upper Elementary School. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, 
and regulations pertaining to 
hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.  The School Site Safety Plan is reviewed and upda
ted each August, based on the feedback of the 
school staff and site council. Our Safety Plan is aligned to the Big Five guidelines from the County. All revisions are commu
nicated to all members of the 
Arroyo School staff including the certificated and clas
sified staff.  The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff 
safety during a disaster. Big Five drills are conducted on a monthly basis throughout the year and are coordinated with Centr
al Middle School, the other 
sc
hool that is co
-
located on the same campus. Staff are trained annually on the Big Five Protocols with ongoing check
-
ins before and after each drill.  
Safety plans are communicated with parents through principal's memos in our weekly newsletter.  Students a
re supervised by staff before school, during 
lunch and recess and after school. Once school begins, the gates are locked and all visitors must check in at the office to b
e on campus.  There are also 
designated and well supervised areas for student drop off
 
and pick up on the campus.

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are 
provided at both the district and individual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The district offers two full
-
day staff development days annually, and eight Wednesday afternoon sessions, 
where staff members are offered professi
onal growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Common Core Standards, 
Next Generation Science Standards, Project Based Learning, Readers Workshop, Writers Workshop, Math in Focus and technology i
nfused instruction 
are bein
g integrated into the curriculum. Teachers also review student data, make timely decisions based in data, and share practical
 
tips and strategies 
with each other, during their collaborative prep and meeting time. This year, we continued coaching and collab
oration sessions for teachers during the 
school day. In addition to opportunities through the district, site "Flex Funds"  as well as other targeted budgets are used 
to provide professional 
development to teachers to attend workshops, observe in other clas
srooms and to collaborate with colleagues. Areas of focus are determined by our 
Strategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.
