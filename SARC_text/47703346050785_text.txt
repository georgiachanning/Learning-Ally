By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
"We at Weed Elementary School believe it is our responsibility to provide quality educational programs which foster 
significant academic achievement for ALL students in a safe environment 
by promoting mutual respect and acceptance of 
individual differences."
 
 
Weed Elementary School is located at the base of majestic Mt. Shasta in far northern California in Siskiyou County, one 
hour north of Redding and an hour south of the Oregon border, ju
st off Interstate 5.  The school site is centrally located 
on a hill overlooking the town of Weed.  The campus is arranged in three separate building groups to accommodate the 
primary, intermediate and middle school classrooms.  There is a large gymnasium 
complete with locker rooms and a 
separate cafeteria with a full commercial kitchen.
 
 
Weed Elementary School District is a kindergarten through eighth grade district with an enrollment of approximately 280.  
Approximately 84% of our student population parti
cipates in the free and reduced lunch program. There is a high rate of 
mobility in Siskiyou County.  Our K
-
3 grades use the reading program Success For All, 4th
-
5th grades use Benchmarks and 
our middle school, 6th
-
8th grades, use Amplify.  We have adopted 
California Math for 6
-
8 grades and Math Expressions 
for grades for K
-
5.  We offer intervention programs for individual and groups of students in grades kindergarten through 
eighth during the regular school day and for two hours after school.  Our middle sc
hool program continues to improve in 
preparing our students to be college and career ready.
 
 
We believe that parents are our partners in education. We have an active Site Council and a parent group called Cub Power 
that sponsors numerous fundraisers throug
hout the year to help support our student activities. We provide a variety of 
extra curricular activities including co
-
ed volleyball, cross country, girls and boys basketball, cheerleading, track, student 
council, peer counseling and we use PBIS as our sys
tems of approach to behavior. WES offers many different electives for 
6
-
8 grade classes such as cooking, VAPA, music, coding, technology, 3
-
D printing and design, small engine exploration, 
tutoring, Elevate Youth (leadership curriculum/program) and green t
eam.  We have a SAFE program (Siskiyou After School 
For Everyone) operated within the guidelines set by the California Department of Education After School Education and 
Safety (ASES) program.  The SAFE Program is open from the end of each school day until
 
6 PM offering a nutritious snack, 
supper, homework assistance, academic enrichment and physical activities in a healthy and safe environment which 
encourages parents, teachers, students and the community to share resources that benefit both the students a
nd the 
community.
 
 
In addition, Weed Elementary School provides a nutritionally balanced hot breakfast and lunch program, a full day 
Kindergarten, small class sizes, as well as daily intervention that is built into the academic schedule for all grades.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan includes provisions for fire, earthquake, ALICE (active shooter on campus) and other kinds of 
emergencies.  In August and September of every school year we practice two off campus evacuation drills.  Fire drills are 
practiced monthly
. earthquake drills are every other month and ALICE drills are practiced quarterly.  The plan is reviewed 
annually by WES safety committee in September, November, January and April.  School Site Council also reviews the safety 
plan at our meetings.  WES ca
mpus has 16 security cameras installed around campus. All exterior doors on campus remain 
locked throughout the day.  Weed Elementary School has also an MOU with the City to employee a 20 hour a week school 
resource officers who is on campus everyday from 
8:00 am
-
12:00 pm.  Every classroom has window coverings for security.
 
 
The Safety Plan includes the framework and provisions for a safe and clean environment for students, staff and volunteers. 
WES is in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations pert
aining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 

and drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.
 
 
Through
out the school day all exterior doors leading to classrooms, quads and hallway areas remain locked from 8:30 AM
-
3:00 PM.  Any person on campus can not get into rooms or hallways unless they check into the school office, receive a 
visitor's badge and are es
corted to the classroom by office personnel. WES employees a School Resource Officer, for 20 
hours a week. This year we moved our after school office to the front office in order to ensure all visitors on campus report
 
to the office without wandering aroun
d the school.
 
 
Our custodians ensure classrooms, restrooms and campus groups are kept clean, safe and secure through well maintained 
classrooms and facilities.
 
 
In August each year the staff of Weed Elementary is trained on the components of the School Safety; emergency response 
map, emergency drills, universal precautions and an analysis of school discipline plan trends and recommendations. 
Monthly drills are als
o held which address fire, intruder, chemical spill or bomb threats.  Weed Elementary School works 
hard to promote continuous school safety.  Weed Elementary School works with the Weed Police Department and Weed 
Fire Department on the ensuring that the com
ponents of the Safety Plan are effective.
 
 
Weed Elementary School has school safety meetings that are scheduled four times a year.  The superintendent/principal, 
head of maintenance, administrative assistant and School Resource Officer attend these meeting
s to review current safety 
issues and concerns.

Discipline practices are in place for the playground, cafeteria, bus and each instructional setting.  All staff has been trai
ned 
and continues follow up training in the area of Positive Behavior Intervention
 
Support (PBIS).  Consequences are geared 
toward changing student behavior.  Time out, refocus sheet, parent contact, bully contracts, behavior contracts, 
detention, referrals and suspension are used to address severe incidents. Weed Elementary School prom
otes positive Cub 
Character by providing monthly activities on and off campus for students who demonstrate on going positive 
behavior/character.  Weed Elementary School also has an Opportunity Class on campus that students may be placed in to 
help support 
our top tier behaviors.  The Opportunity Class is part of our  behavioral response to intervention (RTI).  
Students placed in this class learn strategies and skills necessary to positively contribute in the classroom and school 
through the Second Step curr
iculum, with the ability to earn their way back to the general education classroom.  All classes 
have the Second Step Curriculum to teach social and emotional behavior.  WES has a counselor on campus for 28 hours a 
week.
 
 
Every Monday morning, middle schoo
l teachers hold a meeting with all students and middle school staff to discuss school 
issues, bullying and other problems with the attempt to create a positive classroom environment.
 
 
Weed Elementary has two dismissal times: kindergarten through third grad
e are dismissed at 2:15 PM. Fourth through 
eighth grade are dismissed at 3:00 PM.  Walkers/riders are dismissed first then bus riders are dismissed to get on the bus.  
Every Monday we have a school
-
wide early dismissal at 1:00 PM. Parents and guardians of 
the students at WES park in 
designated parking areas to wait until their student is dismissed.  This keeps the middle of the parking lot open for clear 
vision when entering and exiting the parking lot.

Weed Elementary School is committed to a comprehensive long
-
term plan for professional growth and development. This 
is very necessary as we continue to strive to deliver a rich curriculum to all of our students and sub groups. The district 
office provides 
administrative support as well as financial support of professional growth through federal and state 
resources. We believe that one of the most effective way of supporting student achievement is to invest in professional 
development that will improve instr
uction.
 
 
WES staff sets high standards for all students to achieve. We believe everyone is accountable for student learning. It is our
 

knowledgeable of the curriculum and provide quality instruction. We collaborate in our Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC) in order to help students achieve common core standards, not only in English/Language Arts and 
Mathematics, but in all subjects. 
Professional development in the areas of Professional Learning Communities, Common 
Core Collaboration, Response to Intervention, Data Analysis, LCAP Goals, WES Vision for systematic approach and Behavior 
Management prepare us to accomplish these goals alon
g with our Academic Focus for the school year.
 
 
For the 17
-
18 school year school all teachers, superintendent/ principal, technology coordinator and technology assistant 
attended a county wide technology summit (1 day) prior to school. Two math teachers pa
rticipated in a year long math 
content, coaching and lesson study workshop.  Four of our classified employees attended a paraprofessional training at 
our county office.  A teacher from each PLC grade level attended a two day training on Next Generation Sci
ence Standards. 
In June of 2018,  primary teachers attended a three day training in the area of English Language Arts.  We received two 
days of coaching in our new K
-
5 math program and a day training for 6
-
8 ELA teachers for our newly adopted ELA program, 
Amplify.  We had full staff follow up training in the area of PBIS. In spring of 2018 middle school teachers attended a 
Google training at our county office of education.  In August of 2018, ALL staff participated in a local training with a focu
s 
on Trauma
 
Informed Practices. Intermediate and middle school teachers, technology coordinator and technology assistant 
along with some support staff attended the CUE Conference (2 days) to support the use of 1:1 devices in all grades. All K
-
3 teaches along with sup
port staff will have 18 days of professional development scheduled for this year for the English 
Language Arts program, Success For All. In our PLC meetings we have a County Office employee doing a series of ELD 
trainings for the whole year.
 
 
In August of 
this year 2019, ALL staff participated in a local training through the county office centered around Retorative 
Practices.  Two middle school math teachers are working  on math professional development through the Silicon Valley 
Math Initiative, at the cou
nty office.  Three teachers in grades three and four are participating in a writing series through 
the county office of education.  The district continues to provide professional learning on Monday, early release days, that 
are centered around benchmarks, 
academic data, social and emotional learning by using staff, administration and school 
counselor as the facilitator of these meetings.
 
 
Our LCAP, along with WES's vision and data dictates the direction of professional development for staff. The 
administrat
ion, school board and school site council make suggestions as well. There are both on
-
site and off
-
site 
opportunities and because we are a one
-
district school with limited resources, we often attend the professional 
development offered by the Siskiyou Coun
ty Office of Education or other nearby County Offices.
 
 
Team planning and collaboration (Professional Learning Communities) are an integral part of our school operations.  
Teacher committees, grade level and subject matter meetings and in
-
services provide 
opportunities to develop a 
Professional Learning Community.  Weed Elementary staff meets every Monday to participate in a PLC meetings, grade
-
level collaboration, common core planning and other types of professional development. Through the PLC process, WE
S 
teachers have identifying quarterly common core standards (curriculum mapping), common core benchmarks in both 
English Language Arts and Mathematics around claims and targets.  Our PLC group our focus is around student 
achievement and using benchmark dat
a to strategically ensure all students are learning.  Our PLC's also focus on student 
achievement,  behavior and academic data analysis, Common Core and creating a system change that is best for all our 
students to ensure they are learning.
