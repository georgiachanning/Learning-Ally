School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is 
updated annually based on student and staff changes. The plan covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and 
egress and ens
uring a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in, usin
g 
our Raptor system and by presenting their identification, at the front office prior to ent
ering campus. In instances of 
emergency, we use an automated telephone and email system (Blackboard), and the school website to contact parents 
with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our school cond
ucts emergency drills regularly 
throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire drill each month 
they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the school year.  We also 
participate in Lock 
Down drills three times per year.  All classrooms have posted Emergency Plans and information.  All staff members have 
access to the complete School Safety Plan.

District Commitment to Learning for All 
Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in ac
tive staff development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided durin
g formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and 
provide instructional support as teacher 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff 
development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curriculum 
and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices for e
ach course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning 
Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student ach
ievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
