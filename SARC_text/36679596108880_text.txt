By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
Ridgeview Elementary School opened in 1990.  It operates on a traditional calendar and educates students from 
transitional kindergarten through fifth grade.  As 
principal, I have the pleasure of introducing you to the annual School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC) for Ridgeview Elementary School. The SARC contains important information which you 
can use to learn about all aspects of our school. Information includ
es achievement scores, demographics, ongoing 
assessments, discipline, budget, and a report on facilities. We view this as an opportunity to publish our accomplishments 
of which we are proud, and outline our plans for continued improvement in the future.
 
 
R
idgeview has demonstrated academic improvement as measured by performance on the CAASPP.  These scores are an 
indicator of our success in teaching the California Common Core State Standards at all grade levels.  It is our aim to 
continue to ensure academic
 
success for all students.  The data presented here is used by our teaching staff to facilitate 
change and improvement of our programs.  Our goal in presenting you with this information is to keep every member of 
the educational community informed. To that
 
end, we hope to keep open lines of communication, and we welcome your 
comments, suggestions, and questions about our programs. Thank you for being concerned about the success of not only 
your student(s) but all students at Ridgeview.  You play a vital rol
e in the success of our school.
 
 
SCHOOL MISSION STATEMENT
 
Believing that education is an on
-
going journey, we will work together with families and the community to make a 
difference in the life of each child. We will value individuals, maintain high expect
ations, and create a positive 
environment. We will encourage students to think critically and develop their potential so that they are prepared to meet 
the challenges of tomorrow with courage, imagination, and conviction, while being positive, contributing
 
and responsible 
members of society.

The Yucaipa
-
Calimesa Joint Unified School District sets a high priority to ensure that sufficient and current textbooks 
and 
materials are available to support each school's instructional program. The district went through an evaluation on October 
1, 2019, and has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and/or science lab equipment pursuant to 
the set
tlement of Williams vs. the State of California. The district determined that there are also sufficient visual and 
performing arts materials.
 
 
All students, including Special Education and English Learner students, have access to adopted instructional mate
rials in 
core subjects.  These materials are for use in the classroom and/or to take home to complete required homework 
assignments.  All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district are aligned with the California State Conten
t 
Standards
 
and Frameworks.
 
 
Instructional materials in all subjects were approved by the Board of Education. Although the Board
-
adopted instructional 
materials in Mathematics are not on the State Board of Education list, the materials were recommended by an adoption
 
committee of staff and community members following extensive research on the alignment of the materials to California 
State Content Standards and Frameworks, and a pilot of the materials to study their positive impact on the children we 
serve. The distric
t has not yet adopted instructional materials in History
-
Social Science in the time since the State Board 
approved History
-
Social Science programs in November, 2017. The district is collaborating with community stakeholder 
groups to determine the most appr
opriate materials for implementing the state standards and framework in History
-
Social Science.
 
 
Students are provided with weekly trips to the school's fully
-
staffed and automated library.  The library also sponsors an 
Accelerated Reader program that rewa
rds students for the number of books they read.  For additional research materials 
and Internet availability, students have access to the school computer lab, and are encouraged to visit the Yucaipa Branch 
Library which contains numerous computer workstati
ons and online connectivity.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ridgeview Elementary School is a closed campus. During school hours the entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in 
with the front office. All visitors are required to sign in and wear a visitor badge during their st
ay. While visits by parents 
and community members are welcomed, anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours should notify the staff 
ahead of time. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school, yard aides, the principal, and teachers supervise s
tudents 
and monitor the campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The 
plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each scho
ol includes the 
following requirements of SB 187 within their safety school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine, and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees to and from school; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the 
plan annually and updates it as needed.  The plan was last updated in Fall of 2019. Safety 
procedures, including elements of the School Safety Plan, are reviewed with school staff at the beginning of the school 
year and after every yearly update.
