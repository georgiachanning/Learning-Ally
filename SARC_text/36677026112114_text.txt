By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Carleton P. Lightfoot Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance 
and campus supervision. Original scho
ol buildings were constructed in 1994. Ongoing maintenance ensures school 
facilities are kept safe, in good working condition, and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Carleton P. Lightfoot Elementary is proud of its high standards r
egarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping 
practices. Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus gro
unds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The school secretary, custodian, and 
principal coordinate effo
rts in the preparation and submission of work orders to M&O for resolution. Emergency situations 
are given high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial staff.

director of maintenance and operations (M&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss maintenance

issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, wor
k orders (submitted 
and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with the custodian to conduct a comprehensive 
inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are req
uired by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identif

time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully

cafeteria after meals are served. The custodian checks restrooms frequently throughout the day as a proactive measure 
in keeping facilities stocked, safe, and sanitary. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian i

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populatio
n and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligne
d with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the req
uirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
