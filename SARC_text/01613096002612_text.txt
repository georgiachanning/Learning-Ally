By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
Anti
-
 
Bias Framework Mission Statement:
 
We, the educators of the San Lorenzo Unified Sc
hool District, are committed to working daily to interrupt, disrupt, and
 
dismantle systems that act to replicate historical inequalities and commit to examining systemic, institutional, and 
individual
 
biases that make us complicit in that replication.
 
 
Eq
uity Vision and Mission:
 
As a result, students will become creative, collaborative, compassionate,resilient, well
-
informed and socially responsible 
advocates for equity and social justice as a result of their education,
 
experience and support from educator
s, families and the community.
 
 
Hesperian's vision is aligned with the San Lorenzo School District's Anti
-
Bias Framework:
 
Hesperian School is a large elementary school located in the unincorporated part of San Lorenzo Unified School District 
that serves ap
proximately 589 students in transitional kindergarten through fifth grade. Our student body is diverse 
ethnically, linguistically, and socio
-
economically. 62%  identify as   Hispanic or Latino; 15% as African
-
American;  5%  white; 
9% as Asian,  7% Filipino
, and 1% as other.  51% or 303 of our students are classified as English Language Learners, with 
9% or 52 students re
-
designate. The majority of the English Learners, Spanish is their primary language.  76% or 445 of our 
students qualify for the free or re
duced lunch program.  In kindergarten through third grades, Hesperian provides 
transitional Spanish bilingual classes for children whose parents prefer that they learn to read and write in both English 
and Spanish. We also offer primary language support to
 
many of our Spanish
-
speaking children through bilingual 
instructional assistants and other language support like Chinese through district provided resources as available.  English 
Language Learners receive differentiated DELD (Designated English Language 
Development) instruction  while their English 
Only Peers receive  instruction to support literacy.  Hesperian is unique in that it is one of two elementary schools that 
offers a Spanish bilingual program for K
-
3rd graders. In addition, Hesperian has two sp
ecial day classes serving the needs 
of  autistic children.
 
 
State and federal categorical programs have allowed us to supplement the base district program with the goal of improving 
student achievement in transitional kindergarten through fifth grade throu
gh additional  services like technology 
integration, staff development, literacy coaching, parent involvement, and Restorative Practices. Categorically
-
funded 
teachers provide supplementary reading support for children and their teachers in all grades.  We
 
are  committed to 
ongoing refinement of our Tier 1 Response to Instruction and Intervention  where K
-
5 students will receive targeted 
literacy instruction in leveled reading groups within a balanced literacy framework.

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hesperian School was built as a small neighborhood school in 1952. It has expanded over the years as the student 
population has grown. A mixture of permanent and portable classrooms is now home to 34 classes for stud
ents in 
kindergarten through fifth grades. The campus underwent modernization under the Leroy Greene legislation in the late 
1990s, which ensured that the facility is wheelchair accessible and up to current building codes.
 
 
As part of the recently passed 
Measure E bond, new permanent classrooms replaced four portable classrooms, and the 
library was expanded, doubling it in size. In addition to the library and classrooms, the school has a staff room, a multi
-
purpose room/cafeteria, resource/book room, compu
ter room, and several smaller offices or classrooms for support staff. 
Classrooms are wired for Internet, and most rooms have wireless Internet access. The new permanent classrooms and 
library remodeling has increased the overall support for teaching and l
earning.
 
Hesperian School has been allocated 92.5 hours of custodial time per week and the services of a District maintenance 
crew to ensure that the school and grounds are clean and well maintained. Safety hazards are identified and taken care 
of as soon 
as possible. The relatively small parking lot creates a traffic hazard at dismissal time, but staff is assigned to 
monitor the area to prevent accidents.
 
 
The School District Emergency Plan has guidelines and procedures for dealing with earthquakes, fires,
 
and other 
emergency situations. Staff members supervise students on the playground during recesses and other outdoor activities.
 
This site is had new roofs and gutters installed on the permanent buildings in the summer of 2019. Traffic mitigation 
improvements have been made, by constructing a traffic loop in the front of the school and creating 40 new staff parking 
spaces in the back of the school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Hesperian School Safety Plan is reviewed annually. The Plan addresses emergency procedures in response to 
earthquakes, fires, 
and/or intruders on the campus and how to put these procedures in place. It provides directions for 
monthly practice fire and earthquake drills and twice
-
yearly disaster drills. The School Safety Plan was most recently 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with
 
school faculty during one staff meeting in August and October of 2019.
 
Parents are informed of the student release procedures in case of an emergency as part of the opening packet of 
information all students receive. The Site Site Council (SSC) and PTO ad
dress safety concerns and issues on an ongoing 
basis and input from these groups are gathered to help drive our School Site Safety plan.
 
 
There are a number of other procedures in place to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and other staff members. T
his 
includes requirements for visitor sign
-
in and visitor badges, yard supervision by teachers and other staff, teacher 
notification regarding suspensions and expulsions, closed campus policy, and first aid training for selected staff members. 
All students
 
have completed emergency information cards with medical information and emergency contacts; these
 
cards are on file in the office.In order to ensure that we have proper safety supplies at Hesperian, staff will take inventor
y 
of the safety supplies on hand
. In addition, a safety committee will meet to review procedures and emergency plans.

State and federal categorical programs have allowed us to supplement the base district program with the goal of improving 
student achievement in 
transitional
-
kindergarten through fifth grade through staff development, literacy coaching, and 
improved parent involvement. Categorically
-
funded teachers provide supplementary reading support for children and 
their teachers in all grades. We are committed
 
to ongoing refinement of our Tier 1 Response to Instruction where TK
-
5 
students will receive targeted literacy instruction in leveled reading groups within a balanced literacy framework with 
coaching support from our District TSA's on the newly adopted EL
A F&P Curriculum. 
 
 
In addition, during the 2019/2020 school year, Hesperian is proud to be participating in:
 
 
Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program. SEAL is a preschool through third grade model that provides children 
with enriched and powerful language and literacy education. The SEAL model includes several components:
 

 
Language
-
rich instruction with an e
mphasis on oral language development and high
-
level vocabulary
 

 
High value placed on bilingualism (proficiency in both English and the home language)
 

 
A text
-
rich curriculum and classroom environment that leads to appreciation and love of reading and writing
 

 
An active, engaging and affirming learning environment
 

 
A full curriculum (including science, social studies, arts, math and literacy) that teaches the new rigorous 
standards preparing children for college and career
 

 
Teachers and parents working together t
o support strong language and literacy development at home and at 
school.
 
The Hesperian community is committed to working collaboratively to create systems that support highly engaged and 
rigorous classrooms and a healthy environment where students can lea
rn and thrive. The staff will continue to engage in 
ongoing professional development and collaboration to ensure better understanding and effective implementation of the 
enriched curriculum through the SEAL Model, Common Core Standards, ELD Standards the i
ntegration of technology and 
opportunities like Restorative Practices and Tool Box Chacter Education (SEL Curriculum) and RTI2 that further support 
student success. The staff will work together to build capacity using Multii
-
Tiered Systems of Support to pr
ovide 
intentional, appropriate academic, social and emotional support for students.. Families will be offered many opportunities 
to be involved in their child's schooling to learn what can be done to support their child's education. The Single School 
Plan 

 
 
In addition to ongoing site
-
based professional development, all teachers have the opportunity to improve their skills by 
taking college courses, workshops in various areas offered through 
differing Departments at the District Office, and in
-
services or other workshops offered by the County Office of Education or other organizations. Teachers have opportunities 
to attend professional conferences supported by site or District funding. 
 
 
Profe
ssional Development for New Teachers:
 
Through participation in the Teacher Induction Program, the District secures support providers to work with our new 
teachers. Through this Teacher Induction Program, new teachers are also afforded the opportunity to ta
ke university level 
courses at a reduced tuition cost. This program offers training to new teachers for two years, as they sharpen their skills 
as educators. The induction portion of this program leads them to acquiring their clear credential through the C
ommission 
on Teacher Credentialing.
