By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

library and several classrooms were remodeled.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools i
n good working order are completed in a timely

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad

students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

All school sites in the Manteca Unified School District annually update the Disaster Plan and School Safety Plan. The plan 
was revised by Safe Schools Consultants and Site Administration according to the required adoption process with 
appropriate School Si
te Council public hearings and School Safety Planning Committee input. Teachers and staff annually 
receive training on disaster procedures. Teachers and staff received ongoing training throughout the 2019
-
2020 school 
year in order to meet the appropriate g
uidelines established by the state. The safety plans are confirmed and approved 
by March 1, 2020.
 
 
Manteca Unified School District continues to make strides in the improvement of the educational climate and reduced 


students and the security of campuses are high priorities in MUSD. School personnel and students participate in monthly 
disaster preparedness drills including specific proced
ures for fire, earthquake, flood, civil disturbance, and hazardous 
chemical situations. The school sites also focus on establishing goals that are needed.
