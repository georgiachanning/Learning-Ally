Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Leggett Valley Elementary School is a small, rural schoo
l nestled in the beautiful coastal hills of Northern California. Our

relatives. Our school is truly an extended family.
 
 
Leggett Valley Elementary School strives to provide the best education experience for each child while working with 
students individually to meet their
 
academic needs. With our average classroom size at 12 students these words are not 
just statements they are reality.
 
Leggett Valley elementary students get individualized instruction and attention!
 
 
The mission of LVUSD is to provide academic excellence i
n a safe, responsible, and respectful environment. Our 
commitment is to ignite motivation, creativity, self
-
discipline, and a love of learning by providing students with the

school building. Our kindergarten is a stand alone program. We have
 
combination classes at the 1

levels, and 5
-
6 grade levels.  Each combination classroom averages 12 students.We also have a classroom for our resource 
program and a multipurpose room which is used for music, assemblies and after

s
chool activities. Our campus is shared 
by Leggett Valley High School with a common cafeteria and gym.
 
 
The District Facilities Committee meets annually to review our five year maintenance plan and to discuss issues that need 
to be examined and prioritized 
w it h our facilities. Our campus was recently renovated and is in good condition.
 
 
In the summer of 2017 we added solar panels to our campus to make it more energy efficient.  We also changed all lighting 
to LED.  Our water system project was completed in
 
2018 and we now have drinking water available throughout the 
campus.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

The 
opportunities for parent involvement within the school are many and varied. The following represent opportunities 
for our parents to become involved with the district and in the schools. Each year we send out a survey asking parents to 
help with events at 
school. Parents are encouraged to bring their talents to the students at Leggett Valley Elementary 
School.
 
 
1. Classroom Volunteer: Volunteer help is always encouraged and welcome in the schools. Parent volunteers often seem 
to drop as children advance thr
ough the grades, although the need for volunteers continues for all grades. Interested 
parent and community
 
members can contact Anthony Loumena, Principal, at 925
-
6285 for further information.

responsibilities are defined by state mandates. This advisory council ensures that the school's 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement is being
 
implemented and assesses periodically the effectiveness of
 
each program. The Site Council meets quarterly during the 
school year. Interested residents should contact the school principal, Anthony Loumena at 925

agendas posted 72 hours in advance for regular Board meetings. Meetings are generally held on the second Wednesday 
of each month. Meetings
 
alternate monthly between Whale Gulch and Leggett Valley schools. Public input and attendance are 
encouraged. Contact 
the district office at 925

4. District Advisory Committee: This committee is comprised of representatives from throughout the school district . The 
main purpose of the committee is to advise the school board 
on the Local Control Accountability Plan. Meetings are held 
in February, March, April

5. Wellness Committee: Meets annually to develop and promote district
-
wide health, nutrition and physical education 
activities.
 
 
6. Activity Nights/Field Trips:
 
Each year there are numerous outreach activities held for students and their parents; these 
include our Talent Show, Winter Program and Spring Fling . These events are enjoyed by all who attend. We also have 
numerous field trips that
 
parents may help chap
erone.

Each year parents come into classrooms and teach a small unit on something they are passionate about. 
This year we have a parent teaching ceramics and two high school studentsteaching dance.

days on the first and third Friday's of each month during the school year. These days allow the staff to meet as teams to 
work on best practices , plan curriculum, discuss studen
t achievement, revise assessments, discuss school safety and work 
on other necessary and essential components of the school program. The district staff development program continues 
to encourage teachers to participate in various professional development o
pportunities. Some of these may include:
 
 
1. Participation in professional development during the three paid teacher in
-
