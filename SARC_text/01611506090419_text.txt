School Description
 
Palomares Elementary is committed to providing a quality environment for 
student learning. We 
are dedicated to success for all students, families and staff. Our goal is to provide inspiration for 
life
-
long learning while implementing positive, effective approaches to education that build a sound 
academic foundation and promote 
self
-
esteem and interpersonal skills.
 
 
In 2015
-
16, Palomares Elementary received the Gold Ribbon School honor from the California 
Department of Education. In 2011
-
2012 and 2007
-
2008, Palomares Elementary School was 
recognized as a California Distinguished 
School. In 2005, Palomares was recognized as a NCLB 
National Blue Ribbon School. These high honors were earned through the academic efforts of the 
students, the support of the parent community, and the dedication of the staff. 
 
 
On April 14, 2018, Palomare
s Elementary School celebrated it's 150th Anniversary. Established in 
1868, the original charter was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. 
 
 
We celebrate learning as an engaging and dynamic experience. Students are immersed in a 
challenging standards
-
based 
curriculum in Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, History
-
Social 
Science, and Visual and Performing Arts. Teachers work collaboratively to ensure that a balanced 
comprehensive curriculum builds logically and consistently throughout the elementary grades. 
The 
Palomares staff continues to implement innovative and reserah based teaching strategies to assure 
all students have the best opportunity to learn. As students interact and apply their learning to real 
life situations, they are instilled with a life
-
lon
g passion to ponder ideas, set goals, share in a vision, 
view others' perspectives and challenge themselves.
 
 
We value collaboration between home and school. Parents are encouraged to actively participate 
in their child's elementary school experience. Oppo
rtunities for direct involvement include 
membership on School Site Council and our Palomares Parent and Teacher Club (PPTC), 
volunteering in the classroom with special projects, teaching a lesson as a professional in one's 
field, assisting in the library, 
supporting school
-
wide fundraisers and seasonal celebrations, and 
participating in campus beautification days. Our parent community is an invaluable asset to our 
school. We believe communication is an integral link in a successful partnership, and to maint
ain 
that relationship, teachers and the principal are readily available for open door discussions. This 
partnership ensures that each child excels to reach his or her fullest potential.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Palomares Elementary School is located at the east end of Castro Valley, nestled in a quiet canyon surrounded by wooded hills
ide
s with a creek flowing 
at its edge. Palomares opened in 1868 as a one
-
room schoolhouse after the trustees of the Palomares School District bought 1.21 acres of land for the 
sum of $60.50. In 1955, a larger three
-
room school was built across the creek from 
the original site. After eighty
-
seven years, the old school said farewell 
to its last class of students. In 2016, voters approved Measure G which will bring many improvements to the campus.
 
 
Currently, Palomares Elementary School serves 145 students in gra
des K
-
5. There are six classroom teachers, a Principal, and additional support staff 
including our Science and PE Specialists, and Special Education teacher. The campus consists of six classrooms, a library/off
ice building, a science center, 
and a multi
-
us
e room. The original cast iron school bell is proudly displayed in the center of the school grounds.
 
 
Our natural surroundings allow Palomares to serve as an environmental science model school, integrating environmental educati
on with rigorous core 
curricu
lar standards and research
-
proven best practices. Our science lab allows Palomares students to incorporate technology with hands
-
on, inquiry
-
based activities.
 
 
Palomares Elementary School is a safe, healthy, nurturing school community that encourages posit
ive attitudes in students and staff. Lighting, cameras, 
additional fencing, and an electronic gate were added, increasing campus security. A joint effort helps keep the campus clean
, well
-
maintained and litter
-
free. District maintenance staff ensures that 
necessary repairs are completed in a timely manner. A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service 
and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sma
rter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 

afety Plan is revised annually by our School Site Council, which is comprised of the principal, teachers, classified 
personnel and parents. In addition, our Safety Plan is annually reviewed and discussed with staff. Every effort is made to ma
intain communi
cation with 
the Office of the County Supervisor regarding traffic concerns. Safety is addressed often during the school wide weekly Frida
y Flag Welcome Assembly. 
morning announcements and regular reminders regarding safety concerns are sent to families via
 
email and our school newsletters. Due to the unique 
location of the campus, the Safety Plan includes evacuation procedures in case of wildfire in the canyon. Emergency supplies 
are stored in our Emergency 
Container. Emergency drills including fire and ear
thquake drills are conducted on a regular basis, and secure campus drills are held each trimester. 
Palomares School participates in the California Great Shake
-
Out Drill every October, simulating emergency procedures in a large scale catastrophe.

Each year there are two days of district
-
wide professional development during the school year. 
The areas of focus for these district professional 
development days are developed through collaboration of teachers, site administrators, and district administrators.
 
 
Additionally, site areas of focus are determined by the teaching staff and principal tha
t are in alignment with our district's strategic plan and priorities at 
the beginning of each school year. MTSS and RTI refinement including identification of essential standards and development of
 
formative assessments 
continue to be a focus of learning a
nd professional growth at the school site level. These areas are identified using student achievement data and a school 
culture assessment. Staff is encouraged to pursue other professional development opportunities in order to better their instr
uctional pr
ogram, improve 
their teaching practice and most importantly, better meet the educational needs of our students. Professional development is 
delivered in a number of 
ways, including district
-
wide workshops, conference attendance, and site
-
based workshops in
cluding time during staff meetings. Teachers also receive 
professional support through in
-
class coaching and meetings/trainings with our district Science and Technology TOSAs (Teachers On Special Assignment) 
and individual meetings with the site principal.
