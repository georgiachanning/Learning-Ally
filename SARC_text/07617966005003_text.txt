By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure
 
that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repai
r and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning sch
edules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

regular voice and/or written communications, our school's website, the Valley View Community Website, Peachjar, and a 
monthly calendar. Valley View also holds Family Math Night, Literacy N
ight, Science Night, STEM Night and The Arts Night.
 
 
Valley View Elementary does not have a Parent 
-
 
Teacher Association (PTA) but is the "friend of" the Valley View Parents' 
Club (VVPC), a registered 501 (c) (3) organization: The VVPC hosts community
-
buil

principal in attendance.
 
 
School Site Council (SSC): Every elementary school must have a School Site Council composed of five parents
 
or community 
members, the principal, three classroom teachers, and one other staff member (Education Code Section 52852). The role 
of the Valley View SSC is to empower elected members to work democratically to improve student achievement and 
provide leade
rship and accountability for closing the achievement gap.
 
 
Valley View is working on organizing an African American Parent Advisory Council )AAPAC and an English Language 
Aquisition Committee (ELAC).

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is 
to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.

The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, di
saster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
Th
e objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the 
District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the
 
District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School 
Safety plan will be avail

Valley View teachers attend a variety of professional development sessions throughout the school year. Teachers at Valley 
View participate in professional development to enhance visual 
and performing arts, science, math, and STEAM 
instruction. Professional development in these and technology and best practices are offered on
-
site and throughout the 
district.
 
 
This year our focus is writing using New Teachers Reading and Writing Program w
ith a continued emphasis on Multiple 
Methods of problem
-
solving, showing evidence in reading comprehension and writing, and student discourse. Quality 
instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensur
e this, the Academic 
Support Division engages teachers, administrators, and other personnel in ongoing professional development focused on 
improving teaching and learning.
 
 
Training is provided to principals and other administrators to improve their abilit
y to provide strong instructional 
leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The principals, in turn, provide support to teachers through 
staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and planning, and individual coaching based 
on ongoing classroom 
observations.
 
 
Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site professional development in all standards
-
based 
curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, professional development is provided in English Language
 
Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), differentiated instruction and educational technology. In addition, 
training is made available in classroom management and the effective use of assessment data and teacher data teams in 
meeting the needs 
of all students. A primary goal of the professional development program is ensuring that all students 
are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional 
leaders.
