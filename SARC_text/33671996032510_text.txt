By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Perris Elementary is the oldest school site in the district. Seven classrooms built
-
in 1948, and the remaining permanent 
classrooms were built in 1953. We modernized the entire school in 1995. Presently there are 19 portab
le classrooms and 
22 permanent classrooms, a library/media center, and a multipurpose building. Our facilities department update 
infrastructure, green and hard spaces, and other spaces/areas as needed. Carpeting and interior updates occur as the 
classroom 
or space needs it. The exterior of the school was painted during the summer of 2013. The exterior fences and 
paved areas were all updated in 2008. A new slurry coat to the paved area, as well as new stripping, was conducted during 
the beginning of the 2017
-
2018 school year.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation of 2004.  In the assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structur
al integrity, 
electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The vital purpose of this assessment is to determine if our 
buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs repairing, this assessment identifies it. It targe
ts a 
date by which we commit to making those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written by the Office of Public 
School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can find the six
-
page Facilities 
Inspection Too
l used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC. The most recent school inspection took place on 
November 20, 2019. No emergency repairs were needed, and no unsafe conditions were found. All restrooms were fully 
functional and available for student u
se at the time of the inspection.
 
 
To determine the condition of the facilities, district representatives inspected them. They used a survey, called the 
Facilities Inspection Tool, issued by the Office of Public School Construction. Based on that survey, w
e have addressed the 
information you see in this summary. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the 
date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

We support a robust and positive partnership with parents and the community. Parents and families can volunteer 
individually or as p
art of a group. If a person would like to volunteer at school, the first step is to complete a volunteer 
application form. Perris Elementary School has many opportunities for parents to be active participants in school activities.
 
Parent teams support many
 
of our student programs, making the learning experience both productive and culturally 
relevant. Parents stay informed of volunteer opportunities with upcoming events and school activities through our 
Peachjar information system, parent portal, school new
sletters, school marquee, and Blackboard messenger (automated 
telephone message delivery system). Individuals and families are encouraged to participate in a decision
-
making group, 
our Family Involvement Action Team (FIAT), Parents as Partners, and Family 
Night Programs. All of these programs allow 
for interactive volunteering and informative decision making. Parent groups meet regularly and work on school initiatives 
that assist in increasing student achievement in Reading and Math. Daytime activities for 
parents include workshops, 
Wake
-
up, and L.E.A.D. events focused on readers as leaders and volunteer visits. An array of after school opportunities 
for family nights (i.e., Math Night, Holiday Performance, Science Fair) occurs throughout the school year. Ac
tivities for this 
group range from fundraising to assisting in the classroom and at times in the front office. Parents can join our School Site
 
Council, which works with the Principal to help make real
-
time educational decisions on various school goals. Pa
rents of 
English Learners are vital to our English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC) and our outreach efforts on behalf of new 
families. Other parent volunteers help with special projects in the classroom and chaperone field trips.
 
We invite all parents t
o attend Back to School Night in the Fall, Open House in the Spring, and Parent
-
Teacher Conferences 
in November. We always need new volunteers! If you would like to help out, contact our front office staff at (951) 657
-

ication.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Perris Elementary School staff works with District Office staff to develop a site safety plan and an emergency preparedness 
plan, laying out procedures for responding to a wide variety of situations. Students and staff practice emergency 
procedures monthly
 
and review emergency plans. Our school site has several representatives who participate in the 
District Disaster Preparedness Committee. The individuals involved include teachers, administrators, and other school 
staff. The safety team ensures that all sa
fety procedures are in place and updated. The school safety team attends district 
level meetings and brings valuable information back to the entire staff. Our Custodial staff and the District Maintenance 
staff inspect our school site for safety concerns fr
equently and scheduled "safety checks" weekly. Staff members and yard 
supervision aides monitor children whenever they are outside the classroom. As students transition from outside recess 
to their classrooms, our yard supervision aides provide opportuniti
es for learning, reinforcing leadership habits. The 
Comprehensive Safe School Plan includes safety practices, according to Ed Code. A copy of the plan is available for 
inspection by the public at the front office. School administration and teaching staff p
lace a high priority on providing 
adequate adult supervision on campus before, during, and after school.
 
 
Together, the teachers and administration collaborate to strengthen practices for teaching and learning. The school's staff 
has established a culture 
of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (P.B.I.S.), that encompasses universal 
expectations. The students learn skills to help them be safe, respectful, responsible, and leaders in all areas of the school
 
campus life. Our school is a leadership aca
demy in which students focus on the core pillars of a successful student defined 
as L.E.A.D., which stands for learning, excelling, achieving, and determination in all academic aspirations.
 
 
We have an enclosed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must en
ter and depart the school through the main door. All 
visitors must sign in at the office, presenting a valid government identification. Each visitor uses the Raptor® system and 
is provided a visitor/volunteer badge to wear throughout their stay that descri
bes the purpose of their visit. All visitors at 
Perris Elementary School must sign in at the front office and wear a visitor's name tag. The front office staff and supervisi
on 
aides enforce this system daily to ensure that all visitors have checked
-
in with
 
the front office staff.
 
 
Our school has a school Safety and Disaster Preparedness Plan with specific procedures for handling emergencies. We 
hold monthly practice drills for fire and lock
-
down procedures. The school's safety committee, consisting of staff
 
and 
parents, review and update the safety plan annually. In October, we hold a Disaster Drill to prepare students and make 
them aware of all procedures involving an earthquake type of emergency or disaster. Students and staff practice different 
emergency 
procedures and drills, including evacuation practices. Each day, the staff monitors the playground and campus 
before, during, and after school. We have strict policies that prohibit fighting and bullying. All playground equipment and 
school facilities unde
rgo inspections.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually, and it reflects current procedures and practices. The plan includes emergency 
procedures, exit routes, safe supervision of students, and student family reunification routines. We share the 
plan with all 
staff during a school
-
wide staff meeting. We practice fire, earthquake, or lock
-
down drills monthly and hold staff training 
on emergency preparedness at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year.

building through the Leader in Me program.
 
 
Professional development is ongoing and consistent throughout the year. School staff meets for professional development

build the Unit of Study and participate in collaboration time to plan in order to enhance and enrich weekly lessons, 
providing a content
-
rich and rigorous education for a
ll students.
