By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Located in downtown Riverside, Bryant is an ideal location as it is centered among the city's museums, theaters, library, 
and art galleries. Authors, artists, architects, poets, and performers, alon
g with other civic organizations, have shown a 
growing interest in developing partnerships that will support this new program. While enthusiasm for Core Knowledge 
and its potential for students is high, the challenge remains to make citizens aware of this 
school choice. Since Riverside 
Unified has become a "District of Choice," students from within Riverside's boundaries, as well as students from outside 
its borders are welcome to apply for transfers to attend Bryant Elementary in the winter for the followi
ng year.
 
 
Core Knowledge at Bryant School is a great way to link Riverside Unified School District's educational options with our 
city's motto of "City of Arts and Innovation," not only for our residents, but all interested parties. As the curriculum unfo
l
ds, 
no matter what level of ability a student starts with, he or she will experience a sense of achievement as knowledge and 
skills are mastered. The Core Knowledge Sequence covers language arts, history and geography, mathematics, science, 
art, and music,
 
and comprises the bulk of the school's curriculum. Other areas of study, such as local and state history, 
technology and physical education, are integrated with what is being taught in the Core Knowledge program.  Bryant also 
offers additional opportuniti
es beyond the instructional day to engage, enrich, and empower students 
-
 
including our 
afterschool HEARTS program and E3 program/clubs.
 
 
Bryant's Mission Statement is:
 
 
The Bryant community commits to create a school with a nurturing, stimulating, and acc
epting culture:
 
* where students engage in rigorous standards
-
aligned instruction that results in high levels of student achievement, and
 
* that builds self
-
motivated, life
-
long learners who are academically, socially, and emotionally successful; culturall
y 
literate; and good stewards of the core virtues.
 
 
Bryant has aligned its goals with those of the Riverside Unified School District.  Namely:
 
1. Provide high
-
quality teaching and learning environments for all students.
 
2. Prepare all students to be 
college, career, and world ready upon graduation.
 
3. Fully engage students, parents, and the community in support of short and long
-
term educational outcomes.
 
 
Our strategic focus is fluency and comprehension across all content areas.  Additionally, we str
ive for increased student 
attendance and high levels of student engagement, digital literacy, and student achievement through utilization of 
technology for learning, as well as a measure of assessment.  Progress towards these goals are monitored via our sc
hool 
plan and are measured frequently throughout the school year, including formal and informal assessments, observations, 
attendance records, and teacher records.  Data is analyzed and informs instruction and next steps via the informative 
inquiry cycle (
analyze, plan, act, reflect).

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the
 
total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.
