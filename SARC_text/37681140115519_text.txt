School Description
 
Santa Margarita Leadership Academy currently provides a single classroom 
environment with a 
combination of students in grades 6
-
8. The class is led by one teacher, one classroom assistant, and 
contains a maximum of 15 students. The small adult
-
to
-
student ratio provides intensive academic 
assistance, strategies to develop social
 
skills and provides opportunities for success. A school 
counselor works with groups and individual students weekly to focus on leadership social skills. In 
addition, both parents and students are encouraged and assisted to obtain additional outside 
counse
ling when needed. All students receive instruction using the California State Standards and 
district
-
adopted textbooks in all core subjects. A lower student
-
to
-
teacher ratio allows teachers to 
work in small groups or one
-
on
-
one more often to facilitate stu
dents meeting the standards. Santa 
Margarita Leadership Academy uses sound classroom management techniques as well as many 
positive reward incentives to assist students in making good choices and in developing positive 
behavior.
 
 
Santa Margarita Leadership
 
Academy students are expected to meet the following learning goals:
 
1.
 
Every student will communicate and work effectively with others
 
2.
 
Every student will demonstrate proficient skills in reading, writing, speaking, social studies, 
mathematics, science, and t
echnology
 
3.
 
Every student will demonstrate responsibility to oneself, their school, and the community
 
 
Mission Statement:
 

interests and abilities to achieve academi
c, social, and future career success.
 
 
Vision Statement:
 
Santa Margarita Leadership Academy is an alternative program for students who have experienced 
challenges in the traditional school environment. It is an academically and behaviorally focused 
interve
ntion program designed to assist upper elementary and junior high school students:
 

 
Establish a pattern of academic success and good attendance
 

 
Transition back to a regular elementary and junior high school or promote to high 
school
 

 
Develop new habits in at

future success in school
 
 
The District believes the educational success of our students is dependent upon quality academics, 
effective programs, and community partnerships. The Santa Margarita
 
Leadership Academy is 
student
-
centered and adapts to meet individual needs. We believe that:
 

 
All students can learn
 

 
Each student should be given the opportunity to fully develop his/her potential
 

 
There is a need to facilitate learning by drawing on indivi
dual strengths and learning 
styles
 

 
Structured educational environments and programs help our students to learn
 

 
There is a need to embrace diversity
 

 
Collaborative relationships are essential in delivering quality services and effective 
programs
 

 
We are 
accountable through evaluation of students and programs

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. 
Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the 
school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Santa Margarita Leadership Academy, we believe parent involvement is critical.  We are committed to daily communication wi
th our families.  Prior 
to entry
 
into our academy parents/guardians are provided with an individualized intake meeting and our staff is available for one
-
on
-
one conferences as 
needed.  As a partner school with Potter Junior High our parents are also welcome to participate in or attend al
l parent education opportunities and 
events they host, along with participating in or attending PJHS Parent Teacher Association and School Site Council meetings.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Clima
te (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan* (CSSP), including 
a disaster preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office
 
on Camp Pendleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, at
tend site and district safety meetings and collaboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safety Plans are available for review at ea
ch school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures
 
for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strategies and programs that will 

d to sc
hool safety. Students, 
teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emerg
ency skills, policies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional fe
edback is sought from all participants to continually improve emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to fost
er lines of open 
co
mmunication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or thre
ats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many pos
itive programs exist districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Practic
es, Suicide Prevention, Anti
-
Vaping Education and Trauma
-
Informed Practices.
 
 
*The San
ta Margarita Leadership Academy students and staff are included in the Maie Ellis Elementary CSSP and work collaboratively to
 
meet student 
safety needs.
