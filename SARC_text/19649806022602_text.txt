About the SARC
 
By Februar
y 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). 
The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding
 
Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and
 
local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

School Safety Plan
 
Malibu Elementary opened in August of 2019.  The principal Chris Hertz has extensive background with school safety and Safe S
chool Plans.  Our campus 
has full security fencing and is locked during school hours.  All visitors including parents must pass thr
ough our single entrance and have their ID scanned.  
We use Raptor screening to ensure that no offenders ever enter our campus and to document who has entered, when they entered 
and left and where 
they went on campus.  We have also replaced our intrusion m
onitoring system to prevent after
-
hours theft and vandalism.  The principal and the elected 
School Site Council has been reviewing and adapting the Safe School Plan template provided to us by our school district.  Thi
s plan includes procedures 
for every co
nceivable crisis or disaster including earthquake, fire, bad air quality, bomb threat, bus crash, and threat on or near campu
s.  It also have 
procedures for staff on how to mobilize after a disaster or crisis to care of students and adults, and systematica
lly reunite students with their families. 
(No student may be released to anyone not listed on the student's emergency card.) A public hearing of this plan was conducte
d on January 9, 2020 and 
was forwarded to the Board of Education on January 30, 2020 for 
further review.  The plan has been given to both the local Sheriff and Fire Department.  
Members of law enforcement and fire were active in the development of the plan.  The Safe School Plan will be posted on the s
chool website by March 
2020 as required by
 
California Code.  All tactical and personal information is redacted prior to posted so as not to inform criminals.  An abstra
ct of the 
plan will be part of the School Handbook by March 2020 and all subsequent years for parent and community review.  Staff 
training is ongoing and in the 
future will occur at the beginning of the school year.

All teachers and staff in SMMUSD participate in ongoing professional development through banked time, a total of 90 minutes o
f meeting and 
professional development time each week at each site. Malibu Elementary School's major focus area was determined by a
 
review of summative and 
formative data collected from our founding schools, Cabrillo and Pt. Dume and from data collected at the beginning of the 201
9
-
2020 school year.  Our 
analysis of data and best practices from our founding school lead us to select si

our Friday Bank Time 90

minutes weekly to teach one
 
another as some staff are already highly trained in most of the areas of focus.  We also utilize district sponsored trainings
 
that match our goals.
