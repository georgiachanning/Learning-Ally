of
 
talented,
 
eager
 
learners,
 
a
 
dedicated,
 
creative
 
staff,
 
and
 
active,
 
supportive
 
families.
 
We
 
provide
 
a
 
rigorous
 
standards-based
 
curriculum,
 
and
 
have
 
high
 
academic
 
and
 
behavioral
 
expectations

all
 
children.
 
We

At

we

that
 
each
 
child
 
is
 
a
 
unique
 
and
 
special
 
person
 
capable
 
of
 
high
 
levels
 
of

HVE™s
 
comprehensive
 
safety
 
plan
 
was
 
reviewed
 
in
 
August
 
by
 
staff
 
members.
 
It
 
includes
 
information
 
on
 
emergency
 
procedures,
 
first
 
aid,
 
evacuation
 
and
 
crisis
 
management.
 
Emergency
 
supplies
 
were
 
updated
 
for
 
the
 
year
 
as
 
well.
 
The
 
comprehensive
 
plan
 
will
 
be
 
presented
 
to
 
all
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
law
 
enforcement
 
for
 
plan
 
approval.
 
The
 
plan
 
includes
 
all
 
drill
 
procedures,
 
a
 
schedule
 
of
 
drills,
 
and
 
the
 
Crisis
 
Response
 
Plan
 
for
 
Emergency
 
Preparedness.
 
As
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
security,
 
all
 
visitors
 
and
 
parent
 
volunteers
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
sign
 
in
 
at
 
the
 
office
 
and
 
wear
 
a
 
badge
 
while
 
on
 
campus.
 
School
 
staff
 
is
 
instructed
 
to
 
question
 
any
 
visitor
 
they
 
don™t
 
recognize.
 
Regular
 
classroom
 
volunteers
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
have
 
fingerprint
 
and
 
TB
 
clearance
 
through
 
the
 
district
 
office
 
before
 
beginning
 
their
 
work
 
in
 
classrooms.
 
Regular
 
safety
 
and
 
evacuation
 
drills
 
are
 
completed
 
on
 
a
 
monthly
 
basis
 
with
 
intruder
 
drills,
 
shelter
 
in

and
 
earthquake

2018-19 School Accountability Report Card for Hidden Valley Elementary School
 
Page 10 of 12
This
 
year
 
is
 
the
 
fourth
 
year
 
of
 
PBIS
 
implementation,
 
Positive
 
Behavior
 
and
 
Intervention
 
Supports,
 
an
 
initiative
 
which
 
includes
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
restorative
 
practices.
 
Hidden
 
Valley
 
staff
 
and
 
students
 
focus
 
on
 
character
 
education
 
to
 
promote
 
a
 
positive
 
and
 
safe
 
school
 
climate.
 
Each
 
year
 
we
 
present
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
assemblies
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
bully-free
 
school
 
community.
 
We
 
also
 
implement
 
the
 
Peacemaker
 
Program,
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
30
 
students
 
(grade
 
3-5)
 
chosen
 
by
 
their
 
classes
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
campus
 
peacemakers
 
for
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
Peacemakers
 
facilitate
 
students
 
in
 
walking
 
the
 
Peace
 
Path
 
with
 
their
 
peers
 
to
 
peacefully
 
resolve
 
conflicts.
 
Having
 
the
 
Peace
 
Path
 
permanently
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
playground
 
allows
 
students
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
path
 
and
 
communication
 
tools
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
at
 
any
 
time.
 
In
 
addition,
 
restorative
 
practices
 
have
 
been
 
implemented
 
as
 
an
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
discipline
 
process,
 
and
 
community
 
building
 
circles
 
training
 
has
 
been
 
provided
 
for
 
all
 
teachers.
 
 
Finally,
 
to
 
add
 
to
 
the
 
safety
 
of
 
our
 
school,
 
three
 
years
 
ago
 
security
 
cameras
 
were
 
installed
 
throughout
 
the
 
exterior
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
to
 
monitor
 
the
 
campus
 
24/7.
 
In
 
addition,
 
a
 
new
 
security
 
system
 
was
 
installed
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
2013-14
 
school
 
year
 
using
 
Measure
 
C
 
funds.
 
 
The
 
Hidden
 
Valley
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
will
 
be
 
presented
 
and
 
hopefully
 
approved
 
by
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
at
 
a
 
public
 
hearing
 
on
 
2/11/2020.
