School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-
20
 
 
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relev

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental Involvement
 
GT School of Innovation welcomes parents and grandparents to volunteer in classrooms and on special projects. Our 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) consists of very dedicate
d parent volunteer leaders who meet monthly to plan 
fundraisers, give back to our community, beautify our school and provide extra student support. We urge all parents to 
support and join the PTA.
 
 
Another important parent group at GT School of Innovation 
is the School Site Council (SSC). The parent community elects 
parent representatives to the SSC, and they meet with SSC staff representatives to help examine assessment data and 
conduct surveys to guide an action plan for improvement called the Single Scho
ol Plan. For more information about how 
to get involved as a parent volunteer, please call Wendy Westsmith at (530) 333

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Safety
 
We emphasize providing a safe environment for our students and regularly conduct safety inspections. We conduct 
systematic evacuation and emergency drills on a monthly basis. The local fire department, emergency medical technicians 
and ambulance service ar
e in close proximity to our school and provide immediate response. Our school has a closed 
campus, which allows for a well
-
supervised environment. All efforts to ensure building safety, cleanliness and adequacy 
have been successful. More detailed informati
on on our safety and evacuation procedures is in our school safety plan. 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty in January 2020.

GT School of Innovation continuously upgrades the skills and knowledge of its educational team through a variety of 
training activities. These include staff development days, 
conferences, workshops and participation in professional 
development activities. There are in
-
service opportunities available yearly for classified and certified staff. The staff has 
been actively involved in the creation of the staff
-
development plan for 
the school year. Teacher leaders take an active 
role in planning and implementing staff development.
 
The curriculum at Georgetown is based on the district course of study in language arts; the District Curriculum Guide for 
Parents; and the state Curriculum
 
Frameworks in language arts, mathematics, science, history and social science, and 
visual and performing arts.
 
In 2017
-
18, there are eight days dedicated to professional development with a focus on our RTI systems districtwide PBIS 
as well as Lexia Readin
g intervention and ALEKS Math intervention.
 
In 2018
-
19, there are three days dedicated to professional development with a focus on our RTI systems of districtwide 
intervention, NTN, PBIS as well as Lexia Reading intervention and ALEKS Math intervention.
 
In
 
2019
-
20, there are three district days dedicated to professional development with a focus on NTN Projects that engage 
learners, RTI Intervention, Reading Horizons, Daily 5 and math intervention cycles.
 
We plan collaborative time for teachers strategically
 
so that both teachers and students benefit, and it is done with GED 
(Georgetown Enrichment Days). We use this time to study, examine student work, collaborate and do team building. Our 
goal this year is mathematics alignment and intervention and NTN Proje
ct Based Learning.
 
This year, we have six scheduled GED days. On these special days, teachers are released from classroom responsibilities 
and are able to use data to examine student performance related to the Common Core State Standards and explore topics
 
developed during summer professional development. This examination is used to determine how to drive instruction at 
GT School of Innovation in the future.
 
Additionally, Georgetown has staff receiving professional development from a New Tech Network, El Do
rado County 
Office of Education, El Dorado County Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA), and other organizations and educational 
institutions.
