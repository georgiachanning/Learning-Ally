By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Vision Statement:  All Franklin students can, and will, learn at high levels in a safe, supportive, and nurturing 
environment.
 
 
School Description:  Franklin Elementary School is an urban, public school located in west Modesto, 
California, 

Our enrollment is 792 students in Transitional Kindergarten through sixth grade.  Additionally, we have 84 Head Start and
 
State Preschool children on our campus, for a school wide enrollment of 876 students.
 
 
Our campus is diverse and comprised of approximately 74% Hispanic or Latino, 6% Asian, 6% White, and 6% African 
American. 53% of our students are second language learne
rs, 11% of our students have a diagnosed learning disability, 
and 98% are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Franklin Elementary has 55 certificated staff members and 40 classified 
staff.
 
 
Franklin is a generational school where the veteran faculty are now 
proudly teaching the children of former Franklin 
students.  Many of the teachers have advanced graduate degrees and certificates (i.e. Masters, Doctorate) and our support 
staff members are passionate about meeting the academic, behavioral, and social
-
emoti
onal needs of our students.  
Additionally, our dedicated Resource Specialists, Instructional Paraprofessionals, District Improvement Facilitator, 
itinerant professionals (School Psychologist, Speech Therapist, Library Assistant, Mental Health Clinicians, S
tudent 
Assistant Specialist, Family Support Specialist, Healthy Start Coordinator, Nurse, Health Clerks, Prep Providers, Computer 
Literacy, and Music teachers), and three site administrators work together with families and the community in a 
collaborative 
partnership to build a positive school community and strengthen student achievement.

Our large campus houses 31 Transitional Kindergarten through sixth grade classrooms, one Head Start class, three 
Preschool classes, a library, a resource classroom, two i
ntervention centers, and two computer labs. Our emphasis on 
literacy is reinforced by two Instructional Coaches, three MTSS Intervention Instructional Paraprofessionals, two Title I 
Instructional Paraprofessionals, and a District Improvement Facilitator wh
o work closely with classroom teachers in using 
research
-
based programs to support struggling readers in grades K
-
6. Teachers provide targeted intervention during the 
school day, as well as after school tutoring in the RISE program (Rigorous Intervention f
or Students Excellence) to promote 
proficiency in reading comprehension and fluency. The After School Education and Safety (ASES) Program provides 
homework support, enrichment opportunities, performing arts, and sports activities for approximately 270 stud
ents. Our 
Healthy Start Program offers parenting, nutrition, and empowerment classes and connects families to a variety of 
community services. Our collaborative network of business and community partnerships enables Franklin students to 
receive mentoring a
nd additional literacy support. Collectively we endeavor to: (1) provide each student with a relevant 
educational experience that addresses real
-
world problems; (2) cultivate life
-
long learners; and (3) develop a respectful 
and responsible citizenry.
 
 
The 
instructional program at Franklin is built upon an infrastructure of Response to Intervention (RTI).  We believe that all 
students can, and will, learn at high levels in a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment.  In Tier I, students are taugh
t 
through
 
high
-
quality and research
-
based instruction in all areas, but focusing particularly on English Language Arts 
curriculum and standards.  In Tier 2, every student is strategically placed into intervention reading groups, using data, and
 
are given differenti
ated small
-
group instruction based on their reading levels.  This allows all students to receive the 
instruction they need to continue to grow in the ELA standards.  Students needing additional support receive Tier 3 
interventions from a Resource Specialis
t or Instructional Paraprofessional.  The focus on Tier 3 is for those who have not 
responded to all other interventions.
 
 
Franklin embraces the Peace Builder philosophy, which includes several tiers of support, including Restorative Practices.  
Teachers u
se the district
-
adopted materials in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies.  The school 
also has two computer labs, which are used to teach students keyboarding, word processing, and presentation skills.  In 
addition, the school h
as two reading intervention centers, which are used to provide students with reading intervention 
support throughout the day.

The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the District Office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensu
re that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and

lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they receiv
ed a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
