By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

School Profile 
 
 
Home of the Roadrunners, Canyon Rim is situated in a quiet, residential neighborhood adjacent to a park in Anaheim Hills, 
California. It is one of 27 el
ementary schools in the Orange Unified School District. The 20 year
-
old school serves 
approximately 670 students in transitional kinder through sixth grade. The school facility is well maintained, with 29 
classrooms allocated for general education classes,
 
behavioral special day classes, a speech pathologist teacher, a Learning 
Lab, STEAM Lab and two day care classrooms. Eleven of the twenty
-
nine classrooms are portable classrooms that 
accommodate the large enrollment. Each set of four classrooms in the mai
n buildings has a central pod area, used for 
small group interventions, assessment testing, etc. The administration building houses the administrative offices, school 
counselor, school psychologist and school nurse office, staff lounge, workrooms, the tech
nology lab and library. There is 
a large multi
-
purpose room to support the community participation in programs and performances. The fence and 
walkways represent the canyon area that surrounds us. 
 
 
The student body at Canyon Rim is 
predominantly white (51.3%) plus 6 other ethnic groups are represented. In addition 
to cultural diversity, students range from behaviorally challenged to intellectually gifted. The contributions, achievements,
 
and progress of all students are valued and ce
lebrated.
 
 
Over the past years, we have embraced a strategic framework for whole school improvement: Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Supports. We continue to analyze data, set goals, and plan appropriate instruction and interventions to improve student 
achievement 
and teacher instructional practices. The Canyon Rim staff and parents use student assessment information 
to:
 
 
1) Deepen the school wide instructional focus. As a result of analyzing SBAC data, Canyon Rim has identified the following 
claims as areas to impr
ove: Listening (ELA), Problem Solving, Modeling and Data Analysis (Math), and Communicating 
Reasoning (Math.)
 
 
2) Develop professional learning communities to improve teaching and learning. PLC's meet at least monthly to discuss 
and compare student 
work samples and data for the purpose of setting high standards, expectations, and student 
outcomes.
 
 
3) Learn and use effective research
-
based teaching practices and engagement strategies.
 
 
4) Implement a targeted professional development plan that builds
 
expertise in selected best practices. Data is used in 

teacher expertise and promoting high expectations for all students. As expertise is dev
eloped, teachers are held 
increasingly accountable for implementation of the strategies.
 
 
5) Re
-
align resources to support the instructional focus. A review of the School Plan shows allocation of resources in 

 
needs.

6) Engage families and the community in supporting the instructional focus. Families know, understand and support the 
chosen instructional focus through home practices and work in school. There is equity and access for all families and 
community m
embers to the school decision
-
making process and resources through PTA, School Site Council, English 
Language Advisory Committee, and school surveys. 
 
 
7) Work with district office for support. The school is collaborating with the district for continued su
pport in providing 
leadership, coaching, supervision and creative problem solving to ensure our school demonstrates growth in student 
achievement. This time includes time spent meeting with teacher teams to review student work and data, attending and 
deliv
ering professional development and providing follow
-
up coaching.
 
 
Canyon Rim is committed to providing a success
-
oriented and safe learning environment for all students. The teaching 
staff encourage parents to become involved and familiar with their childr
en's school. We encourage parents to support 
our school goals and their children's individual academic goals. We provide home
-
school communication via monthly 
newsletters, SchoolMessenger (phone call and e
-
mail messages), weekly communication folders, SeeS
aw and/or DOJO 
and parent meetings.
 
 
At
-
Risk Students (Below Grade Level, Foster Youth, McKinney, and Socio
-

Canyon Rim offers a Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports to provide intervention for students who are below grade level. 
Sup
plemental materials that are selected are state/district approved, research
-
based, and meet the needs of all students, 
including English Language Learners. 
 
 
English Learners
 
 
English learners receive daily Language Development to improve fluency and liter
acy in English. The English Learner 
program assists students in the acquisition of English for language proficiency, achievement in the core academic subjects, 
and in meeting the state content standards. Teachers support Beginning
-
Intermediate Level Englis
h Learners daily in small 
group instruction. In addition, ELD is integrated within whole
-
group lessons throughout the day using SDAIE (Specially 
Designed Academic Instruction in English) strategies. 
 
 
Special Education Students
 
 
Services for special educat
ion students include a wide continuum of options, such as a a Learning Lab, speech/language 
services, special day classes for behavior, and occupational therapy. SPOT ON (Supporting Positive On
-

d students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs) experience highly trained
-
teachers and instructional assistants who deliver the core curriculum with scaffolding. Students also have frequent 
opportunities for mainstreaming into regular education classroom
s.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Many 
opportunities are available for parents to be involved in their children's education.  Parents participate by attending 
Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, and parent
-
teacher conferences as well as school
-
planned social events and family 
nights.  Parents are
 
encouraged to get involved in school leadership groups such as PTA, School Site Council, and ELAC.  
Our PTA and library media technician are able to provide additional ideas for parent involvement/volunteer opportunities.  
Teachers encourage parents to vo
lunteer on a daily basis in the classroom supporting the needs of the students, teacher 
and school. Canyon Rim also offers a minimum of 4 Parent Education Nights.
 
 
Canyon Rim Elementary School has exceptional parent participation at many different levels. 
 
The Canyon Rim PTA offers 
varied educational enhancements, not only through funding, but  also by being actively involved on all levels. The PTA 
supports the instructional program by  providing funding and/or volunteers for various instructional support p
rograms. 
This year the  PTA donated funding for supplemental classroom materials and curricular enrichment programs such as 
physical education, Art Masters, K
-
4 music, field trips and technology. PTA also provided dedicated volunteers for in the 
classroom 

Act Music Program, in addition to a myriad of classroom  volunteers. The PTA also provides social opportunities for 
students and their parents such a
s a Canyon Rim Flow Fest, Step It Up, Family Fun Nights, and class parties throughout the 
year.
 
 
Daily classroom activities and a wealth of student performances beckon parents to become involved. Parents participate 

 
communication cards where they can voice concerns and give input to current 
events happening at the school. Student performances across the curriculum bring parents to Canyon Rim daily along with 
a plethora of volunteers.
 
 
The Canyon Rim School Site Counc
il, composed of staff and parents, reviews the instructional program and approves 
additional State funding for staff development, supplemental  educational materials and instructional supplies. The School 
Site Council meets 4

d their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Child Welfare and Attendance. The office of Child Welfare and Attendance provides plan development assistance to the 
schools and maintains a file of i
ndividual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted monthly. All schools in the 
district are linked through an emergency radio contact system, and distri
ct radio drills are held periodically to be prepared 
in case of an actual disaster. Providing a safe environment for our students is of paramount concern at Canyon Rim. Canyon 
Rim has a Site Safety Plan monitored by the School Site Council. The plan is rev
iewed with the faculty each fall and 
periodically during the year as we implement our plan. The 2019
-
2020 plan is scheduled to be reviewed with School Site 
Council on 12/10/2019.
 
 
Our safety and behavior goals for the 2019
-
2020 school year will include pro
moting character education through the Big 
R characteristics  (Respectful, Responsible and Ready to Learn) with a Kind Heart emphasized by the classroom teacher 
and school

assistants, noon duty 
supervisors, bus drivers and parent volunteers. Bus, bike and walking safety procedures are 
addressed in age appropriate class discussions and assemblies. School rules and guidelines are reviewed each 2x a year by 
the Principal at a Standards Assembly for 
all students.  Parents are informed immediately, through a strong home
-
school
