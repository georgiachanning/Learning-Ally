School Description
 
Heritage School is a 70,000 square foot campus located along Santa Lucia Road in the Otay Ranch 
development of Chula Vista. It opened on July 10, 2001, and is currently home to 800 students. 
Heritage School represents a new prototype that reflects Chula Vi
sta Elementary School District's 
progressive perspectives on educational facilities for the information age. The school's unique 
''village
-
like atmosphere'' is the result of a planning process that included input from the 
community, educators, administrato
rs, and maintenance personnel. The design includes expanded 
classroom square footage and auxiliary planning space due to the impact of class size reduction. 
The Heritage campus includes eight single
-
story structures, including an administration building, a
 
multi
-
purpose building, a library, and seven classroom buildings. The village atmosphere of the 
campus fits beautifully with the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Heritage School is the 
school district's 38th school.

innovative, and socially conscious thinkers for their immediate future and beyond.
 
 
~Heritage Dual
 
Language Immersion~
 
The mission of Heritage's DLI program is to develop biliterate and bilingual critical thinkers. 
Students acquire high levels of critical thinking in English and Spanish
 
language proficiencies while meeting academic common core state st
andards in both languages. 
Students develop social
 
consciousness, global responsibility, and appreciation of their cultures in 
our society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE 
LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

The parents at Heritage School truly enhance our educational program.  The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) sponsors many pr
ojects for
 
the benefit 
and enjoyment of our children.  Many parents and members of the community volunteer in the classrooms and assist with special
 
events.  The community 
feels welcomed at Heritage School and they actively support our school.  They recognize the im

success.
 
 
Currently, we offer programs that encourage parent involvement and participation school
-
wide.  Parents participate through the School Site Council 
(SSC), English Language Advisory Committee 
(ELAC), Parent Teacher Organization (PTO),  and as classroom volunteers throughout the year.  Quarterly 
Coffee Chats with the principal help maintain ongoing communication and build a strong home
-
school partnership.  A parent volunteer committee 
supports t
eachers and students in the classroom.  Parents and students are supported through parent trainings and differentiated instru
ction within the 
classroom.
 
 
All cultures and languages are affirmed and respected at Heritage Elementary School.  We embrace diver
sity and promote acceptance, respect and 
tolerance.
 
 
Teamwork is the key to our school's success.  All stakeholders, students, parents, and staff work together to enrich learning
 
opportunities for our students 
and to make Heritage School a place of educati
onal excellence.

programs, child abuse awareness, and weekly character education lessons. Our monthly Pride Assembly centers on creating and m
aintaining a safe and 
positive learning community. We offer positive reinforcement
 
for behavior through our Heritage Heroes program and Caught You Being Good Slips. Our 
School Resource Officer (SRO) and school psychologist support Heritage in ensuring that students are safe physically, sociall
y, and emotionally. Heritage 
School implemen
ts the Project Wisdom program.  There is ongoing training for students and adults. Our campus fence provides a safety feature
 
to our 
school. Students must be signed out in the office by the parent or designee prior to leaving the school grounds. All staff 
and visitors are required to report 
to the office using the Raptor System and wear a badge while on campus. Our school's Safety Patrol and parent volunteers assi
st our school in enforcing 
traffic and pedestrian safety. Our school's Peace Patrol helps stude
nts learn how to resolve issues on the playground.  We are proud and confident that 
students and adults feel safe at school. The School Site Council approved the School Safety Plan on September 19, 2019.

classroom teachers are given the opportunity to collaborate and review instructional practices, as well as receive profession
al development in identified 
areas of need.
