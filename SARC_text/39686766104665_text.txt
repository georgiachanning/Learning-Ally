About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The main fact a
bout textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes for all students.
 
The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is
 
far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Washington School understands that all parents may not be able to support students by physically being on campus, but we  sti
ll believe that parents 
and guardians can support our learning environment and their students by the following: Mon
itoring student attendance,
 
monitoring completion of student homework, monitoring and regulating television viewing; participating in the decision making
 
process in school 
organizations and committees,planning and participating in activities at home that s
upport classroom learning;volunteering in the classroom, and

School Safety Plan
 
At George Washington Elementary School, a strong emphasis on ensuring the safety of all students and staff members is embedde
d within the school 
day. A comprehensive School Safety Plan, which wa
s recently reviewed by the School Site Council, helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean 

ies and natural disasters. 
Emergency 
drills are conducted on a regular basis. Our School Inspection Checklists for Elementary Schools is done quarterly and it is 
used to detect and 
correct unsafe conditions. If needed, we submit work orders promptly so corrective action can be taken.
 
 
Every e
ffort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, teachers, site ad
ministrators, 
campus security assistant and school staff provide supervision for students before, during and after school. The play
ground is safe for all students. All 
visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their passes at all ti
mes. Visitors must return to the 
office and sign out upon leaving the school.
 
 

stodial team ensures the school facilities are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each y
ear a deep 
cleaning process occurs during a close of school, either during the summer or other extended breaks. In the event of a f
acility plant emergency, the 
principal notifies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the student
