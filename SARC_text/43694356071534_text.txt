About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sc
hool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availabilit
y of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to 
take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according t
o a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.
 
The district does not have a formal textbook adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
deter
mine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public meetin
g aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to 
California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted by the SBE, s
o long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the di
strict are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Laurelwood Elementary School, originally constructed in 1971, is currently comprised of 18 permanent classrooms, three portab
le classrooms, four 
specialist classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, t
hree staff rooms, and two playgrounds. All classroom interiors were also painted between 2005 
and 2007, and lunch tables were installed on the outdoor patio in 2005. The school's exterior was repainted in 2016 and three
 
awnings were built over 
the lunch ta
bles as well. The chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Laurelwood Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adop
ted cleaning standards 
fo
r all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with empha
sis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The princip

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

ial staff on a regular basis, with heavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by Evergreen Schoo
l District to ensure that 
school grounds and facilities remain in excellent re
pair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received
.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Th
e State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, p
lumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided sch
ool districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In a
n effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good rep
air.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
