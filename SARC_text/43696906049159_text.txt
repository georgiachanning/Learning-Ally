By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vargas Elementary is a neighborhood school consisting of transitional kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms and 
serving approximately 485 students in the heart of Sunnyvale and Silicon Valley. Our diverse student population in which 
o
ver 21 languages are represented and our strong community culture provide for outstanding educational opportunities. 
Vargas Elementary is a science
-
focused school and began the journey of focusing on inquiry
-
based science instruction for 
all students in 20
13. Our unique science program, Student Success through Science, allows students a variety of 
opportunities for inquiry and exploration, and to make real world connections to their learning. We believe that science 
provides a foundation for critical thinki
ng. In turn, students learn to question, interpret data, base decisions on evidence, 
and develop intellectual independence. Our role is to foster and encourage students' natural curiosity. We do this by 
providing learning opportunities both inside and outs
ide of the classroom through field trips, and visits to our on
-
site 
science lab, maker space, and outdoor garden/lab. 
 
 
Vargas Mission Statement: At Vargas Elementary School, we strive to create an engaging learning environment in which 
students develop th
eir sense of social responsibility, scientific curiosity, and desire for lifelong learning. 
 
 
At Vargas, students succeed through science. We believe:
 

 
Science provides a foundation for critical thinking.
 

 
Our role as educators is to foster a sense of 
curiosity.
 

 
As scientists, it is vital to investigate and learn about the world around us.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Vargas values 
family involvement and offers many opportunities for families to learn, volunteer, and support the Vargas 
community.  Vargas School encourages parents and caregivers to be actively involved in their child's classroom through 
voluntary participation.  Paren
t representatives serve on our School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, and 
our PTA. Parents/caregivers and community members play a valuable role in classroom activities, field trips, and our 
Reading Partners program.
 
 
This year our parent
s/caregivers will also have the opportunity to participate in a variety of courses facilitated by Foothill 
College Family Engagement Institute on a variety of topics including supporting literacy at home, mathematics, and 
developing a supporting environmen
t at home. Vargas is also offering several sessions of a digital literacy with the support 
of a grant through the City of Sunnyvale and Columbia Neighborhood Center.
 
 
Throughout the year Vargas has several opportunities in which families are invited to cam
pus and participate in family 
nights. These nights include interactive and hands
-
on learning opportunities for the whole family. Family nights include 
Family Reading Night, Math Night, Science Fair, STEM Night, Family Fitness Night, and Game Night.
 
 
Parent
s/caregivers are encouraged to contact Heather Willhalm, Vargas Science Coach, with ideas of how their skills can 
be incorporated into the Vargas science learning community.  Parents/caregivers can also contact Kathryn Armstrong, 
Principal, or John Austin,
 
Assistant Principal, for information about volunteer opportunities on campus. All volunteers 
must complete the Sunnyvale School District volunteer forms and submit for District approval.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vargas has a Comprehensive School Safety Plan to ensure a safe and orderly environment. It was reviewed by School Site 
Council on November 7, 2019.  The 
goals outlined in the plan are:
 
1.
 
Decrease the number of referrals during recess, lunch, and class time.
 
2.
 
Maintain a clean and safe learning environment that promotes cultural awareness and celebrates our diverse 
school community.
 
 
Staff, law 
enforcement, and parents/caregivers were instrumental in formulating this plan and ongoing monitoring is done 
annually with our Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) and school leadership teams. Fire, earthquake, and 
lockdown trainings are provided
 
annually and drills are scheduled throughout the year to ensure we are well prepared.  
With the support of ICS for Schools, a district
-
hired consultant, we have been able to look at school and district safety 
protocols and make necessary adjustments to en
sure student and staff safety. We examine our Social Emotional Well 
Being and school climate data via Panorama and PBIS surveys.
