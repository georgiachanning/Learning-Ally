FROM THE PRINCIPAL
 
 
I would like to welcome you to the Kermit McKenzie Intermediate School's Annual School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC) and thank you for taking time to explore it. The McKenzie staff 
is made up of passionate intermediate sch
ool educators who believe very strongly in our role in 

understand the changes the student in this age group encounters in regards to their physical, social 
and emoti
onal development. Our collective vision can be defined within our new campus motto of 
Bobcat PRIDE 

 
Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, Discipline, and Excellence. We want our 
students to persevere when times get rough, be responsible in making the r
ight choices that lead 
towards success, demonstrate integrity with excellent conduct, stay dedicated and disciplined to 
achieve goals, and show their excellence by being the best they can be. Together with parents we 
have an opportunity to guide these stud
ents through their mistakes, which are inherent to their 
development as young adolescents, and turn them into positive learning experiences.

achieving success and afford them the opportunity to ultimately choose their own path, whether that b
e college or career. I welcome 

ack 
so that we can best serve our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information abou
t the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend t
o meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, s
ee the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Guadalupe Union School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that sufficient and current textb
ooks and materials are available to support 
instructional programs. As a result of the site visit on September 3, 2019, pursuant to the Williams Settlement, Guadalupe Un
ion School District had zero 
findings and was determined to have (1) "sufficient" stand
ards
-
aligned instructional materials in four core subject areas, (2) facility conditions that do 
not "poses an emergency or urgent threat to the health or safety of pupils or staff", and (3) the schools provide accurate da
ta on the annual school 
accountabi
lity report card related to the sufficiency of instructional materials and the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school fa
cilities.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional ma
terials, or both, in core subjects, 
health, and visual and performing arts for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks in all subject areas are aligned 
with the California Content 
Standards and are selected from the state's most recent list of sta
ndards
-
based materials. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according 
to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making textbooks used in the school the most current availabl
e.
 
 
The table displays information collected ab
out the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Kermit McKenzie Intermediate School sits on eleven acres.  School facilities span 30,000 square feet, and include 28 classroo
ms, a media center, workout 
room, student services center, cafeteria, administrative of
fices, restrooms, and storage rooms.
 
 
The November 2016 election addressed the need for a school facilities bond, allowing for the construction of a new middle sch
ool to be built at the 
southeast corner of the new Pasadera Development Project, the addition
 
of an eight classroom wing at the current site and upgrade of playfields.  
Developers have begun construction on a new housing development.  During the course of the next several years as the new (800
) homes are built, it is 
estimated that 448 new student
s will enroll in our district.  It is estimated that each new residential unit will generate 0.6 students for grades kinderga
rten 
through eighth grade. Until the new housing development is complete and the district is able to build a new junior high schoo
l
, adequate facilities will 
continue to be a challenge. The Guadalupe Union School District participates in the State Financial Hardship program which pr
ovides assistance for 
districts that cannot provide all or part of their local share for a School Facili
ty project.
 
 
Future planned projects include upgrading of bell and intercom system; increasing security at entrances; and pavement rehabil
itation at Kermit McKenzie 
Intermediate School.
 
 
MAINTENANCE REPAIR
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Mai
ntenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working are completed in a timely 
manner.  A work order 
process is
 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency and safety related repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
CLEANING PROCESS AND SCHEDULE
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district.  All schools are cle
aned daily. A summary of these standards is 
available at the school office of the district office. The site administration team works with the maintenance, custodial and
 
operational staff to develop 
preventative maintenance and cleaning schedules to ensure
 
a clean, safe campus.

glish langua
ge 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may particip

[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

ty of California and

Parents and the community are very supportive of the education program at Kermit McKenzie Intermediate School. Parents and co

are always welcome to visit the campus. Our s
chool programs are enriched by contributions of local organizations such as the local Kiwanis Club, 
Guadalupe Historical Society, local American Legion, the Barajas Foundation (Jaime Barajas 
-
 
Info@BarajasFoundation.org), the Boys and Girls Club of 
the Cen
tral Coast (Roberto Rodriguez

many others.
 
 
Parents are encouraged  to be involved in their child's education through volunteering in the classroom,
 
participating at curriculum nights, as well as 
attending school
