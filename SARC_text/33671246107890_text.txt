neighborhood, with a richly diverse student 
population. Our students range from transitional kindergarten to fifth grade. We currently have 24 
classrooms in grades 1

Special Day
 
Classes. The Bear Valley "three R's" are Respect, Responsibility, and Ready to Learn. 
The staff is dedicated to the Professional Learning Communities, as they continue to fully 
implement the core curriculum, and provide the Essential Learning for all stud
ents. The following 
programs serve our students: Regular Education, Resource Specialist Program, English Language

in addition to State, District, and school site

other services to increase student learning. These programs enhance the teachers in their goal to 
challenge and support student learning. Bear Vall
ey's staff is focused on providing a high quality 
curriculum to all students based on specific targets. Teachers work collaboratively throughout the 
year analyzing test scores and establishing SMART goals to raise student academic achievement.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by st
ate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are requ
ired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is t
o be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
 
 
C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We believe that student achievement and success are based upon strong school and community partnerships. Therefore, Bear Vall
ey Elementary School 
encourages and provides a wide variety of opportunities for direct parent and co
mmunity participation.
 
 
Our active Parent/Teacher Organization (PTO) enriches the quality of the school climate by coordinating school spirit activit
ies, as well as numerous 
fundraisers throughout the year. Volunteers are actively encouraged to assist in t
he classrooms, help during field trips, and support teachers with special 
projects.
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC) works immensely hard in recommending and developing the school plan. They review school program
s annually. Our active 
English Learner Advisor
y Council (ELAC) provides input on matters that affect students who receive ELD services. Our African American Parent Advisor
y 
Committee provides input, and insight, on matters that affect our African American students.
 
 
Throughout the school year, the par
ents attend Literacy Events and Family Nights
-
 
enjoying instruction in curricular areas to develop skills they can use 
at home. A committee coordinates activities such as the Math and ELA Nights, Black History, Hispanic Heritage, Multi
-
Cultural Nights and 
student 
performances throughout the school year. The Grade Level Teams provide Parent Workshops to assist parents in providing suppor
t to their children. 
Community involvement is further evidenced by support from organizations that help highlight our acade
mic programs with recognition incentives.
