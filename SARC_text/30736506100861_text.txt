By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission Statement:
 


 
 
A Snapshot of Northwood Elementary School: Northwood Elementary is a neighborhood school that opened its doors in 
1980.  Throughout its 38 year history, Northwood Elementary has enjoyed impressive academic growth and strong 
community support. Locate
d in Irvine, California, Northwood Elementary School serves approximately 600 students, 
kindergarten through sixth grade, in the heart of suburban Orange County.  Established in 1980, Northwood Elementary 
serves a richly diverse student population with stu
dents representing approximately 20 different language groups. Over 

in 1999, to 933 in 2013, a growth of 143 points.  Northwood Elementary beca
me a California Distinguished School in 2002, 

Department of Education awarded Northwood Elementary the prestigious Blue Ribbon Award fo
r its high academic 
performance.
 
 
Mission: At Northwood Elementary School, our dedicated teaching staff, hardworking students, and supportive parents 

 
and speaks 


addre
sses the need to provide our students the knowledge base and critical thinking skills they need to succeed in a rapidly 

ethical and soci

promise.
 
 

To create our v
ision, we enlisted the help of students and parents to join with our teachers in crafting a vision for our 
future.  After bringing all stakeholders to the table, three main areas of focus emerged from our visioning process: (1) 
Fostering a Love of Learning
, (2) Valuing Individuals, and (3) Enriching Learning. We continuously foster a love of learning 
in our school by (a) celebrating accomplishments, (b) motivating student success, (c) teaching with enthusiasm, and (d) 
giving students meaningful project
-
base
d learning tasks. We enrich learning by (a) creating after
-
school programs, (b) 
offering learning opportunities beyond reading, writing and math such as art, music and physical fitness, (c) utilizing 
computer
-
aided programs, and (d) fostering community ser
vice oriented activities.  To value individuals we (a) promote 
character values, (b) praise effort and recognize good work, (c) differentiate instruction, and (d) promote personal goal
-
setting.  As a community of learners, we constructed a compelling pictu
re of what Northwood Elementary could be, and 
by working together as parents, teachers and students, we have taken our school from good to great. Northwood 
Elementary embodies the spirit of No Child Left Behind by: (a) identifying all students with learnin
g difficulties, (b) 
providing research
-
based interventions (e.g., Response to Instruction and extended learning opportunities) to help those 
with learning difficulties improve, (c) using proficiency data to measure learning levels, (d) setting individualiz
ed learning 
goals, and (e) continuously improving instruction. In so doing, we endeavor to have all our students perform at high levels.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Northwood School Community continuously focuses on providing a safe learning environment for all students. School 
safety and cleanliness are a priority.  Our efforts are focused on keeping all students safe before, 
during and after school.  
Northwood provides before and after school supervision by certificated staff members and the staff works as a team in 
an effort to prevent unauthorized access to school.  There are established procedures for check in / visitors, s
upervision 
of grounds, student pick
-
up and drop off.  To alleviate congestion during drop off and pick up times, lanes have been 
reconfigured for drop off only and drive through only.  Additionally, eight visitor parking spaces were added.
 
 
During the summ
er of 2007
-
08, Northwood Elementary underwent extensive re
-
modernization.  Upgrades included 
upgraded bathrooms for students and staff (ADA compliant), new doors, soundproofing, complete classroom renovations 
(including new paint, new carpet, and structura
l changes to comply with ADA statutes that have been enacted since the 
school opened in 1980).  In 2008
-
09, the computer lab was equipped with new computers and monitors, and all portable 
classrooms were outfitted with 4 networked computers per room.  For 
the 2009
-
10 school year, all ball walls were 
replaced, new playground swings were installed, a new marquee was mounted on the front of the school, and backpack 
racks were hung to create more space in the classrooms and improve flow through the hallways.  I

approved a historic plan to place energy
-
generating solar panel systems at 16 district sites, including Northwood 
Elementary School. Upon completion, this ambitious project will be the largest solar deployment for a public school system 
in California, and possibly the United States. The clean, si
lent renewable energy systems are anticipated to save the district 
$8 million in energy expenses over 20 years based on conservative estimates. In 2010, Northwood Elementary had solar 
panels installed on its roof surfaces to capture solar energy; the energ
y cost savings for Northwood Elementary will be 
approximately $10,000 per year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

In addition to a school wide discipline program, each teacher has established class
room discipline expectations. Copies of 
expectations and consequences are provided to each parent and student at Back to School Night. Many teachers have on
-
going teacher developed incentive programs in their classrooms. The best way to keep children safe,
 
however, is to 
encourage them to behave safely and be their best selves. We promote safety through the positive reinforcement of 
exemplary behavior. Our students are rewarded for academic and social growth through a variety of programs including: 
 

 
School 
Spirit Day weekly trophy awards
 

 
Monthly character recognition
 

 

 
To reinforce adaptive behaviors and discourage maladaptive behaviors, all students are taught behavior expectations for 
all settings at school in the
 
beginning and throughout the year. These expectations are also clearly communicated to 
parents and reinforced by teachers and support staff. Additionally, students engage in regularly scheduled emergency 
drills, and teachers are trained to implement lockd
owns, search and rescue, and first aid.
 
 
At Northwood, we pursue an integrated approach to creating a safe and positive school environment by complementing 
our academic programs with our Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) system. The logi
c, tenets, and 
principles of PBIS are similar to those represented in Response
-
to
-
Instruction (RTI) such that universal screening, 
continuous progress monitoring, data
-
based decision making, implementation fidelity, are evidence
-
based interventions 
impleme
nted. Literacy and numeracy implementation frameworks are examples of the application of RTI for academic 
behavior, and PBIS is an example of the application of RTI for social behavior. Northwood Elementary School is also proud 
to partner with Harper for K
ids to teach our students important character traits from legendary UCLA Coach John 


 

 
Co
ntinue to implement staff development in Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS).
 

 
Continue to provide continuous training for our PBIS Team and PBIS Coach/Principal.
 

 
Implement Tier II IPBS with PBIS Coach/Principal/IPBS Tier II Team.
 

 
Continue 
to implement and adjust a school
-
wide PBIS behavior matrix (R.O.L.L.: Respectful, On time & Ready, 
Living Responsibly, Living Safely) to meet the needs of Northwood's school culture and climate.
 

 
Continue to conduct PBIS walkthroughs with all students at th
e beginning of the school year to communicate 
behavioral expectations.
 

 
Continue to hold behavior assemblies for all grade levels during the first two weeks of the school year as well as 
during the middle of the year.
 

 
Continue to teach and reinforce charact
er development school
-
wide.
 
Other staff trainings that emphasize a safe school climate include:
 

 
Staff trained in the implementation of Tier I PBIS.
 

 
Staff trained in Tier II interventions and supports for IPBS which supports PBIS.
 

 
Staff trained by Irvine Po
lice Department School Liason, Dr. Ray Chips in the areas of: (1) school lock downs, (2) 
search and rescue, (3) student supervision/parent reunification, and (4) triage and first aid.

The Local Control Funding Formula has 

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spen
d those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the foll
owing programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and 
staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purc
hase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
-
size reduction, 1
0) Additional secondary sections to reduce class size, 11) Middle school 
zero period program, 12) Maintain positive behavioral intervention and support program, 13) Maintain site staffing with 
full
-
time assistant principals, 14) 450:1 counseling ratio, sup
port for large elementary schools and elementary classroom 
aides, 15) Support interventions and supplemental programs impacting English learners, low income and foster youth, 16) 
Continue to build Career
-
Technical Education pathways and blended 0n
-
line lea
rning opportunities for students, 17) 
Develop mental health and wellness programs and hire district and site based staff including support for the Irvine Family 
Resource Center.
 
 
Finally, CONCENTRATION grant funding equal to 50 percent of the base is provi
ded to districts in which English
-
learners, 
low
-
income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent thre
shold.
