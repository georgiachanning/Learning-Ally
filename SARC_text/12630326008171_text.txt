Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are a
ligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy th
e requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Teachers and administrators from both school sites have participated in School Safety Plan Training
 
at Humboldt County 
Office of Education and are actively updating and revising the present Safety Plan to reflect necessary changes. Our 
Comprehensive School District Safety Plan is currently undergoing a comprehensive review with new goals and related 
act
ion plans to be determined.  Gary Storts assumes incident command should an emergency occur. Emergency plans are 
in place, and have been rehearsed. For example, we participated in the Great California Shake
-
out on October of 2019 to 
practice our Earthquake
 
procedure.
