Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Statement of Philosophy
 

ased on the idea that the purpose of education is to provide a continuation of essential 
learning. It is our ultimate goal to supply each student with basic facts and experiences. These will aid our youth in 
becoming self
-
sufficient individuals mentally, p
hysically, socially, and morally so that they can meet the demands of a 
rapidly changing society. It is essential to instill in each student the importance of individual worth and to create a posit
ive 
self
-
image through the personal development of initiati
ve, resourcefulness, and responsibility.
 
 
It is the intent of the faculty to lead students toward being disciplined, productive, informed, and fulfilled individuals. T
o 
achieve the ideals, mutual respect and understanding must be present in the learning pr
ocess on the part of all 
participants
--
the faculty, students, and community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mountain House School, originally constructed in 1893 and remodeled in 1975, offers a safe and secure campus for 
s
tudents, staff, and visitors. The school is currently comprised of two classrooms, one modular with a computer lab, one 
playground, and a multipurpose room.
 
 
The chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
Mountain House School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district governing 
board has adopted cleaning standards for Mountain House School. A summary of these standards is available at the district 
office for rev
iew. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the school site custodial Contractor. The administrative secretary 
works daily with the con
tractor to develop cleaning schedules that ensure a clean and safe school. Additionally, an 
operations and maintenance program is administered by Mountain House School District to ensure proper care, 
protection, and improvement for all classrooms and facil
ities. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
