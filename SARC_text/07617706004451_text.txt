Message:
 
G
lorietta Elementary School is a place of discovery! Administration, teachers, and para
-
professionals aspire to make learning meaningful and challenging for all, while fostering an 
environment that is nurturing, supportive, and inclusive. Credent
ialed teachers are experienced, 
yet actively pursue professional development. Support staff are cherished for their contributions, 
and parents are appreciated for their partnership in the educational process.
 
 
Glorietta Staff, Parents Club, Coordinating Co
uncil, and advisory teams work collaboratively to 
implement District goals, address targeted priorities, and offer meaningful learning experiences. 
Consistently high academic performance (as measured by the California Assessment for Student 
Progress and Pe
rformance) is maintained through differentiated instruction, data analysis, 
implementation of best practices, and strategic support from the instructional support team. We 
approach teaching as facilitators of learning and focus on continuous improvement in
 
literacy, 
mathematics, history/social studies, and science. Teachers receive support and training from the 
OUSD Teachers On Special Assignment. Additionally, teachers devote countless hours collaborating 
with colleagues and are encouraged to attend profes
sional growth workshops and conferences.
 
 
We intend to continue integrating inquiry
-
based learning activities and experiences that are driven 
by the Common Core Standards, real
-
world challenges, and a multi
-
disciplinary application. Our 
goal is to inspire 
students to develop a deeper appreciation for the STEAM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts, Math) disciplines, while fostering innovative thinking, and providing students 
with the Core
-
knowledge and the skill
-
sets necessary to explore, create, collabo
rate and 
communicate in an ever
-
changing society. To help in this effort, Glorietta is fortunate to have a 
STEAM Lab, where weekly, all classes have the opportunity to explore, innovate, and create.
 
 
Regularly scheduled enrichment in art, music, and physic
al education instruction is made possible 
through the generous donations of our parent community. We also have a library technician who 
supports teachers and students during their weekly visits to the library. Parental support and 
financial commitment cont
inue to enhance our learning community with access to identified 
resources, as well as the latest technology tools including chrome carts in all grade 3
-
5 classrooms, 
1:1 iPads in every K
-
3 classroom and adaptive software to enrich the experience of our 21
st
-
century 
learners.
 
 
Beyond the standards
-
based curriculum, students are exposed to character education, focusing on 
nurturing student's social
-
emotional learning. Students participate in the OUSD adopted Kidpower 
and the Second Step program which is a na
tionally recognized character education curriculum. 
Additionally, in support of OUSD's Strategic Priorities, we cultivate ethical and respectful citizens 
through our 'Everyone Belongs Here' initiative that includes themed activities, buddy class 
interactio
ns, monthly community building assemblies, exemplary character recognition, reflective 
school
-
wide read
-
aloud books, and more. We are committed to further developing our caring 
school community with a commitment towards an inclusive and anti
-
bias climate t
hrough our 
partnership with ADL.  Students are also encouraged to get involved in Student Council, Green 
Team, Student Leader and Safety Patrol Team.
 
 
Glorietta is a caring community that prides itself on rich traditions, high academic standards, and a 
dri
ve to cultivate dreams in a global society!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Quality, C
urrency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Orinda Union School District (OUSD) convenes textbook committees to help in the selection process. The textbook committees co
nsist of teachers and 
administrators in the Di
strict. State
-
approved books are reviewed, piloted, and a selection is made based upon pre
-
determined criteria. The books go on 
public display for two weeks and are then presented to the Governing Board for adoption. The district has affirmed that class
 
se
ts or electronic versions 
of textbooks are available to all students, including English learners.
 
 
At the middle school level, class sets or electronic versions are also purchased to eliminate the need of students carrying h
eavy books. Books have been 
purc
hased for all core academic areas as well as visual and performing arts, and music, at all grade levels. Textbooks are Califo
rnia Department of 
Education
-
approved and California Standards
-
based.
 
 
A public hearing is held each October and reports are made q
uarterly to the Governing Board to meet all requirements according to the Williams 
Settlement Agreement.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
