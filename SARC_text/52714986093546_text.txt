About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The campus is designed to facilitate 
teaching and learning in a variety of ways. All classrooms spaces meet, at least, the minimums required by California 
law, are clean, and are equipped with adequate light, heat, technology, storage, etc. In addition, each classroom has space f
or a teacher

Maywood/DaVinci also houses a district psychologist, district counselor, and district technology
 
staff.
 
 
In addition to the academic buildings, we provide access to athletic fields, basketball courts, an outside food court, a larg

and a cafeteria building.
 
 
Our facilities are built and maintained for the purpose of serving 
students academically, physically, and socially. This school has a total of 31 classrooms, 
a technology room, two Makerspace labs, a band room, a gymnasium, multi
-
purpose building, a library/resource room, and an administration building. 
The main campus wa
s built in 1973.  In the spring of 2017 most portable classrooms were removed.  Fifteen new classrooms were constructed and w
ent 
into service in August 2017.
 
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Dist
rict maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. The Maintenance and Operations Department 
works daily with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure clean and safe schools. The school site is reported in good repair as of the November 2019 walk 
through verification.

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy t
he requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
