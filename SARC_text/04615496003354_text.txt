By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Nelson Avenue 
Middle School recognizes that parent/guardian involvement provides one of the most important keys to 
student success. Several opportunities exist that promote parent involvement in our school. These opportunities for 
involvement are open to all parents/gua
rdians of Nelson Avenue Middle School and its community. The School Site Council 
(SSC) is one opportunity for parent involvement. At present, five parent/community members along with four faculty/staff 
members and the principal commit to four  meetings per
 
year to discuss and decide how money is spent on school 
programs and to evaluate the efficacy our School Plan with regards to student achievement and school climate.  For our 
second
-
language families, we host parent meetings through our English Language A
dvisory Committee (ELAC), which is 
made up of parents and guardians of our second
-
language learners. Parents not wanting such an official title or committee 
involvement have the opportunity participate in Pastries with the Principal. This is a  casual gath
ering offered several times 
per year for ALL parents/guardians to meet with the principal. At this gathering, we discuss everything: school safety 
(including bullying), homework, parent education topics, 8th grade promotion, home/school communication, etc.
 
This 
forum provides the principal with valuable information from parents/guardians that may otherwise "slip through the 
cracks," and it's a great Nelson resource for parents. Other opportunities for parents/guardians to get involved include 
volunteering i
n the classroom, either by the hour, day, or whatever works with one's schedule. Another valuable way to 
connect with school activities is to chaperone at a school dance. This helps us with providing a safe and enjoyable 
environment for our students in gra
des 6, 7 and 8. At the end of the school year, our Eighth Grade Promotion Ceremony 
is a time to celebrate our students' successes throughout their time at Nelson. The Eighth Grade Promotion Committee 
meets monthly and is made up of parents/guardians who ar
e dedicated to making the promotion ceremony and activities 
memorable experiences for our 8th grade students as they move on to high school. If you would like to get involved and 
invest in Nelson's students in any way mentioned above (or perhaps you have a
nother idea of getting involved or 
contributing), please contact us at 530

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Nelson Avenue Middle School takes a serious stance when it comes to school 
safety. High standards are established and 
adhered to that promote and instill safety for all participants in areas not limited to harassment, emergencies, bullying, 
and safe comings and goings  to and from the campus.
 
 
There is a Thermalito District
-
wide 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan that is updated annually, Pursuant to Education 
Code 32280 

 
32289. Our vision is to empower all stakeholders in order to create a safe and challenging environment 
where all students and staff can be safe, and students can 
grow academically, socially, and emotionally. We will provide 
an environment which allows for the development of attitudes that promote healthful physical, social, academic, and 
mental habits. This will be accomplished by encouraging pride in self achievem
ent, respect and responsibility toward self 
and others, recognition of students and staff, and positive relationships with young people.
 
 
Monthly safety drills and site meetings are held to report and review safety issues, and a community safety meeting is
 
held three times per school year at the site in order to share safety data and gather input from stakeholders. In addition, 
various safety drills  and inspections are performed school
-
wide on a monthly and trimesterly basis.
 
 
Twice each school year, Nelso
n students each complete the Nelson School Climate survey electronically, individually, and 
anonymously.  Every other school year, the 7th grade class and its parents/guardians also take the California Healthy Kids 
Survey. Reviewing and analyzing the resul
ts of these surveys then takes place by the faculty/staff and students.The data 
is  then shared with parent/guardian groups, School Site Council, site Leadership and Intervention/PBIS teams, and other 
stakeholders where further ideas and actions are adopte
d to address any issues.
 
 
The entire Nelson staff has a priority for each school day, and it takes place even over student learning: that priority is 
student safety. The School Safety Plan is available at the  school site and school website, and it can 
be checked out to any 
parent/guardian wishing to review it or give further input. Again, we welcome community input as we at Nelson work 
daily to ensure that this middle school is a safe environment for our students to learn, play, and grow.

Number of school days 
dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Over the past several years, Nelson Avenue Middle School has consistently provided opportunities for staff to participate 
in a variety of professional learning activities not limited to the 
following: training in English language development (ELD), 
math (CPM), literacy (Wilson Reading), English Language Arts (Study Sync), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), 
Social Studies Framework, Chromebooks for classroom use, Google Classroom, class
room formative assessments, physical 
education, and visual/performing arts. Our teachers are trained in best practices for advancing literacy in students and 
one of the primary foci of the staff is improving the informational text reading of all students i
n all content areas. Teachers 
participate in learning modules, site coaching, extensive collaboration regarding fidelity of program, and study and 
implementation of best practices. Each teacher is further supported via teacher
-
principal meetings whereby th
e teacher's 
pedagogical abilities/content knowledge is observed, assessed, and evaluated, resulting in individualized professional 
growth  goals. All core departments have identified essential standards, and Tier 2 interventions to support students in 
grad
e
-
level content/skills for reading and math are offered during the instructional day. Additionally, the district calendar 
provides 33 minimum days in order to provide teachers the time to collaborate and perfect their professional learning and 
daily pedago
gy. Current faculty collaborations are focused on building Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) with a 
commitment to student achievement. For more information, please contact Rochelle Simmons, principal, at 530
