School Description
 
At North Park Elementary, we believe all students deserve an excellent education that prepares, 
equips, and best positions them to prosper in the 21st century global community.
 
 
North Park Elementary strives to educate the whole child.  
Our goal is to provide a safe, nurturing, 
well
-
rounded education and learning community that meets the academic, social, emotional, and 
physical needs of all our students.  Beyond academics, helping students learn to listen, assess 
situations, communicate 
articulately, advocate for themselves, think critically, work together, and 
navigate relationships is essential.  These are the foundations upon which North Park builds its 
school culture where high expectations, respect, responsibility, academic excellenc
e, and pride 
resonate throughout the campus.
 
 
We believe it takes the entire community 

 
all of us working together 

 
to develop these abilities 
in our children, empowering them to reach their utmost potential, as they are our future.
 
 
Recognized as a Cali
fornia Distinguished School and a Gold Ribbon School, North Park has an 
upbeat, enthusiastic atmosphere where children and adults enjoy coming each day.  In September, 
2019, North Park received a Silver Medal by the California PBIS Coalition for its implem
entation of 
Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports.  Ideas are freely shared, and encouragement is 
always given.  Relationship is very important to our teachers, classified employees, administration, 
parents, and students.  Our belief is that it take
s the entire community to empower children to 

to help staff and students celebrate accomplishments and promote the expectation that all children 
can and will 
learn.

About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sc
hool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Since 1988, California has sought to provide intensive learning experiences for beginning teachers.  To provide an effective 
transition into the teaching 
career for first
-
year and 
second
-
year teachers, programs have been developed statewide and are in use in our district.  The Induction program extends 
individual support and training and supports success in the practice of teaching.
 
Professional growth activities are planned annuall
y based on current needs and input received from staff.  Many workshops on professional effectiveness 
and classroom skills focus on English Language Arts, Math, and Next Generation Science as aligned with the Common Core State 
Standards.  This year 
our tea
chers are participating in professional development activities to learn about social
-
emotional learning and trauma informed strategies for the 
classroom. Professional development is offered throughout the year centering on technology and its integration in
 
the classroom.  In addition, our 
teachers participate in professional development activities to refine their practice in regard to feedback, student dialogue,
 
and lesson elements along 
with other highly effective teaching practices and current research on
 
teaching and the brain.
