By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district
 
uses 
a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
Fischer Middle School was built in 1962. School facilities are being reno
vated according to the Field Act requirements of 
the State Building Code with a focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead containing building 
materials are found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), St
ate, and Local 
requirements. Deferred maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate district buildings. Needed 
repairs and maintenance projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
Whenever possible, school facilities are upgraded to supp
ort and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 

 
the instructional program. The Alum Rock School District maintenance 
staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, 
ensure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that 
classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playground
s are clean for both student and staff use.
 
Regular oversight by district maintenance crews ensures that grass and landscaped areas are well maintained, and that

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019

Fischer Middle School has a very detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and 
procedures in the event of any emergency. The plan also contains the yearly safety goals as determined by the students, 
staff, and 
parents. The safety plan is developed by the Fischer Safety Committee before it is presented to the Alum Rock 
Union Elementary School District Board of Trustees for approval. The safety plan and drill procedures are reviewed during 
the year with all staff.
 
Safety alerts are shared with all staff as needed throughout the school year. In addition, all required 
drills are calendared and completed, and the results are shared with the staff and a School Resource Officer is available 
for daily support. Furthermor
