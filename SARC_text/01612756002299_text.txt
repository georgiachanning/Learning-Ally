School Description
 
The Havens School community is located in Piedmont, a city of about 11,000 residents, nestled in 
the hills above the San Francisco Bay Area.  The original school opened in 1901 and has 
continuously 
been modernized and renovated to accommodate around 450 students.  The school is one of three 
elementary schools in the Piedmont Unified School District
 
 
The faculty of Havens Elementary School is a team of professionals, firm in their resolve
 
to bring a 
world class education to our students. Classroom teachers, teacher specialists in music, art, library, 
reading, math, science, technology and special education, collaborate to integrate curriculum in 
order to best meet the academic, social and 
emotional needs of our students. We strive to cultivate 
critical thinking, social responsibility and collaboration in students and faculty alike.
 
 
Our support staff of custodians, office staff, para educators and administrators work with students, 
families
 
and staff to maintain a positive learning environment for all students so that they can 
realize their potential.
 
 
We redefined our mission and values in Fall 2018:
 
Everyone at Havens Belongs.
 
We are Caring.
 
We are Courageous.
 
We have Integrity
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dat
aquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school g
raduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to 
the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of
 
software programs available on a

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the St

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational program at 
Havens School, volunteering, fundraising and input on school decisions. 
There are a variety of committees, including school site council and the safety committee on which we invite parent membershi
p. Parents are invited to 
volunteer in classrooms regularly
 
in grades K
-
1 and in occasionally in grades 2
-
5.  Havens Parent Club also offers a multitude of volunteer opportunities, 
as do other school support groups and the Piedmont Education Foundation. Numerous programs and activities are enriched by the
 
generous
 
contributions made by the Havens Parents Club, School Parcel Taxes and Bond Measures, Piedmont Educational Foundation and oth

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan provides each student a safe physical environment by providing well
-
maintained buildings, a safe campus and 
safe ingress and egress to and from school.  T
he Principal, faculty and staff provide campus security.  The safety plan address emergency preparedness 
through well communicated plans, regularly scheduled drills, and guidelines for student behavior that are consistently monito
red and reinforced. There 
are monthly fire drills, in addition to shelter in place, lockdown/reverse lockdown, and earthquake drills which all occur du
ring the first half of the year. 
There is also a trischool safety committee that reviews and updates the safety plan each year. The
 
last substantive changes were made in fall of 2017. 
Annual updates were made in fall 2018.
 
In order to create a school environment that is a safe, kind, respectful place for learning, our entire school community util
izes Restorative Justice and the 
Second
 
Step curriculum.

PUSD staff members build their knowledge of curriculum and their repertoire of 
instructional strategies by participating in various types of professional 
learning: local and national conferences, on and off
-
site workshops, coaching cycles, and as members of professional learning communities.  Prior to the 
2016
-
17 school year, the Dis
trict offered three staff development days annually where teachers were provided with a range of PD offerings on topics 
such as Common Core Standards training, differentiation, instructional technology, new math curriculum, and vertical alignmen
t of standa
rds instruction.
 
 
Beginning the 2016
-
17 school year, PUSD instituted a flexible professional development program, which allows all certificated staff to select th
e 
professional learning topic and structure that best fit their learning needs.  Some examples
 
of professional development selected by tri
-
school elementary 
teachers are as follows: differentiated math instruction, teaching reading in small groups, integrated learning, and social e
motional learning.
 
 
In 2018
-
19 we used a new model where the distric
t, site, and teachers determined the content of each of the three days. The district selected training 
on the social justice standards, the site selected training on professional learning communities, and teachers chose a range 
of topics that are relevant 
to 
their teaching. Some topics include integrated learning, phonics, word study, mathematical problem solving and Professional L
earning Communities. In 
addition to providing professional learning opportunities on the professional development days, teacher 
have ongoing professional development 
opportunities at monthly staff meeting and on an as needed/as requested basis.
 
 
New teachers participate in a full day professional development orientation are assigned a mentor as part of the Teacher Indu
ction Program
 
(TIP) or may 
participate with Teachers Engaged in Active Mentoring (TEAM).  Tenured teachers can also participate in coaching by participa
ting in Teachers Engaged 
in Active Mentoring (TEAM).
