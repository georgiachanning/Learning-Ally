About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elementary School District sit

annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office
 
on Camp Pendleton who 
review the pla
ns and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and collaboratively h
elp to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safety Plans are available for rev
iew at each school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strate
gies and programs that will 
provide or maintain a high level of school safety and address the s

teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emerg
ency skills, policies, and 
procedures at al
l school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to continually improv
e emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of 
harm. Teachers and administrators seek to foster lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or th
reats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong stand against threatening behav
ior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist districtwide to enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Practic
