Theodore Elementary School's Vision and Mission Statement
 
 
Theodore Judah Elementary has been a neighborhood tradition since 1937. On the registry of 
historic places, this neighborhood school values each student as an individual and welcomes parent 
involvement.  The school supports student academic achievement in 
all core content areas (i.e. 
English Language Arts, Math, Social Studies, Science, Physical Education) through a rigorous 
curriculum based on the Common Core State Standards, which is taught by experienced teachers.
 
 
By incorporating teaching techniques an
d strategies designed to engage all students and to 
promote life long learning, all students are held to high standards, and GATE services are available 
in grades 2
-
6.  Staff monitors student academic progress during collaborative planning time and 
academi
c conferences.  This data is used to focus staff professional development, and to provide 
data to support instructional planning during teacher collaboration sessions. Staff also uses this 
data to inform supplemental academic student support services, as n
eeded.  All students have 
access to the library and computer lab on a weekly basis.  To support proper school readiness and 
for our youngest learners, Theodore Judah provides Early Kindergarten.   This class provides a 
strong academic and social foundation
 
for kindergarten success.
 
 
Our community believes in educating the whole child, and through our strong partnership with our 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA), we offer weekly instruction in Art, and Music for all students.  
Students are also further enrich
ed through our instructional Garden and Science Alive program, 
which is complementary to our standards
-
based science instruction.  Students engage in leadership 
opportunities by participating in our Green Team, and they lead the way in teaching others abou
t 
recycling, waste reduction and environmental stewardship.  We also have a wide variety of after 
school programs (e.g. speech and debate, Robotics) to extend and enrich the learning day.  Social 
Emotional learning is supported throughout the day through t
he use of our "Principal's High Five":  
Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Kind, Be Learners.  We also celebrate a monthly positive 
character trait.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluat
ion committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the dist
rict's adopted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, paren
ts/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being conside
red for adoption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recomme
ndation. In some instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for 
college and career, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focu
sed on Literacy (including ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportun
ities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessmen
t for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday ti
me provides the opportunity for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fo
stering a shared sense of responsibility.
