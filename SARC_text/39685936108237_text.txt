Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the District 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.
 
The results of this survey are ava
ilable at the District Office. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
Brock Elliott Schoo
l was built in 1987
-
88 including the administration building, multi
-
purpose room, library, and several 
classrooms. Since then portable classrooms have been added for a total of 42 classrooms.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff 
ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The Distric

is available at the school office and at the District Office. Staff works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensur
e a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The District allocates funding for deferred maintenance. The Deferred Maintenance Program includes funding for 
replacement of existing school building components so that the educational process may s
afely continue. Typically, this 

2019
-
2020 budget allocated $640,000 to address deferred maintenance needs throughout the district.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 

plan. As part of that activity there are projects planned at the campus which will be completed through the use 
of local 
funds. State funding will also be sought for those projects which may be eligible for modernization.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All school sites in the Manteca Unified School District annually update the Disaster Plan and 
School Safety Plan. The plan 
was revised by Safe Schools Consultants and Site Administration according to the required adoption process with 
appropriate School Site Council public hearings and School Safety Planning Committee input. Teachers and staff annu
ally 
receive training on disaster procedures. Teachers and staff received ongoing training throughout the 2019
-
2020 school 
year in order to meet the appropriate guidelines established by the state. The safety plans are confirmed and approved 
by March 1, 20
20.
 
Manteca Unified School District continues to make strides in the improvement of the educational climate and reduced 

students and 
the security of campuses are high priorities in MUSD. School personnel and students participate in monthly 
disaster preparedness drills including specific procedures for fire, earthquake, flood, civil disturbance, and hazardous 
chemical situations. The sch
ool sites also focus on establishing goals that are needed.
 
The District has established procedures for submitting complaints against personnel and programs.  An information 
brochure, policies, and forms are available to the public at the school site, on t

a nondiscrimination/harassment report form is used to help staff in reporting and tracking data.
 

ts.  In 
addition, authorized prevention activities include conflict resolution strategies, before and after school programs, and 
district
-
wide efforts to prevent illegal gang activities with Drug Free and Tobacco Free School Zones clearly established 
and p
osted. Our District seeks grants and utilizes the Health Services Department to meet the health and counseling needs 
of students.
