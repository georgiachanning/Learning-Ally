School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School cleanliness standards are enforced district wide. Inspections are conducted routinely. The district maintenance 
crew assures that all graffiti, broken windows and other types of vandalism are repaired immediately. Our school 
custodian and principal 
inspect the yard and buildings every day to ensure safety, and to keep our school clean. Voters 
approved a bond to renovate the schools. A portion of these funds will go toward our school. In the summer of 2013, 
Garden Village got a solar panel to make JES
D more environmentally friendly.
 
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
conducted every year. The most recent inspection was conducted in January 2018. Additional information about 
the 
condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent 
three
-
year period.
 
 
Staff development is made available through district and school site funding. This school year, there are two areas
 
of focus. 
First, the implementation of our new language arts curriculum, BenchMark Advance, and the second area is professional 
development in Bridges which is our newly adopted math program.
 
 
Staff development is presented in various ways. There are afte
r
-
school trainings and release day trainings. The school 
district provides training for Instructional Leadership Team in our focus areas. Then, at the school site, the Leadership 
Team brings the training to the teaching staff.
 
 
After any training, teachers
 
are given support through classroom observations and collaboration time with grade level 
colleagues.
