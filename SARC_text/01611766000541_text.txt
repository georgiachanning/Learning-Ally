School Description
 
John Blacow Elementary is situated in an established neighborhood of Fremont. The campus is 
surrounded by a large park with many trees and lots of open space. Our school mission is to develop 
life
-
long
 
learners, critical thinkers, and global citizens through the delivery of a rigorous 
instructional program, by providing a safe, nurturing environment, by embracing our diversity, and 
by honoring parents as partners. We also have a Spanish Dual Immersion (
SDI) program strand. The 
goal of our SDI program is for students to become biliterate, bilingual, and bicultural by the time 
they leave for junior high school. Although children in this program are taught in two languages, all 
students are expected to mast
er the California State Standards at each grade level.  John Blacow is 
now primarily a transitional kindergarten through 5th grade school.  Beginning in 2019
-
20, 6th 
graders attend Walters Middle School.  However, our Spanish Dual Immersion (SDI) program 
c
ontinues to serve kindergarten through 6th grade.
 
 
Blacow is a high needs school that receives additional funds to provide supports and resources to 
unduplicated students. These funds are used in a variety of ways such as intervention during the 
day and 
technology to assist our students in mastering the grade level standards and to prepare 
them with 21st century skills needed to be competitive in a global society. Our school
-
wide focus 
is to increase student achievement in both language arts and math.   W
e continue with the 
implementation of an English Language Development (ELD) block and the use of Guided Language 
Acquisition Design (GLAD) strategies. In addition, we have before school and during the day school 
interventions, including having our computer
 
lab open before school.  Our intervention specialist 
teacher and para
-
professional work directly with our at
-
promise students during the day on 
foundational skills, reading, reading comprehension and math. Our teachers review data 
throughout the year and 
plan instruction based on their observations and student data. Our 
students also have greater access to our math intervention programs ST Math  and IXL as well as 
our reading software program Lexia and Istation for our SDI program . Each classroom is also 
 
provided  technology resources and equipment such as an LCD projector, a document camera, an 
Apple TV,  iPads, Google Chromebooks, laptops, and a computer lab that allow all students 
additional opportunities to access technology at school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, pare
nts/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availabi
lity of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal wh
ether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our main building was opened in September 1960. There are four wings, which include classrooms, the library, and the staff lo
unge. Another separate 
group of four classrooms in the southeast corner of the campus we ca
ll the annex area. In addition, we have two portable classrooms that serve as the 
science lab and music room.
 
 
In the summer of 2002, we installed ten skylights and eight solar tubes for rooms that had insufficient daylight. This was do
ne to promote a bett
er 
learning environment in accordance with the Herschong Mahone Group study on the positive effect of daylight on academic achie
vement. The next year 
Blacow participated in a Rebuild America program, which provided eight skylights, sensor controlled lighti
ng, high vision bulbs, reflective coating for 
walls, and motion sensor lighting controls for our multipurpose room/cafeteria. This has improved this facility tremendously,
 
and it is enjoyed by everyone 
every day.
 
 
In 2003, the district installed controlled
 

to this same system. In the summer of 2005, our front parking area was remodeled, which has resulted in improved traffic flow
 
and better safety
 
in the 
drop
-
off and pick
-
up zones. During the summer of 2006, new grass was installed on our playground field.
 
 
The most recent improvements to our campus was made in the summer of 2016.  About 85% 
-
 
90% of our classroom and hallway floors were replaced 
t
o remove possible asbestos tiles.
 
 

akes all needed repairs 
and scheduled maintenance. The Facilities Department provides needed imp
rovements, such as the replacement of vinyl flooring in the office and in the 
annex area classrooms.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facili
ties 

ions you see on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the re
port. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 
Our teachers perform before and after school supervision as well as during our daily recesses.   The principal and noon super
visors help ensure a safe 
and orderly lunchtime. FUSD has contract
ed a private security company that monitors the campus on nights and weekends. Visitors must sign in at the 

 
 
We revise our safety plan each year, and it was last reviewed and revised October 2019. This plan includes proce
dures for emergencies and an inventory 
of safety supplies. We hold monthly fire drills and periodic earthquake drills. Several staff members have received American 
Red Cross CPR certification 

anager. Each year our safety plan is reviewed in a staff meeting to ensure that all teachers 
are knowledgeable about our safety procedures. We  have taken several measures to ensure that we are prepared in the event of
 
an emergency. 
Emergency backpacks are
 
provided to each teacher. We have a disaster storage container with emergency supplies which include water, food, batteries, 
sanitation,first aid, and search and rescue supplies. We also participated in The Great California Shake Out, a statewide ear
thqua
ke drill, and plan to 
participate again this year.

Professional Development provided for
 
Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional devel
opment:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
