About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
la
w to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required t
o prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
c
onsistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the 
CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been pro
vided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that are
 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in the foll
owing subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructional
 
materials were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes off
ered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each
 
student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
year. Ad
ditionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing arts.*P
lease note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Boa
rd of Education approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to cons
ider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of p
aramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact 
safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a re
gular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and c
arried out during breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
chool improvement for this 
site was the schoolwide security c
amera system completed in the 2017/2018 school year. and a schoolwide keyless access system planned in the 
2020/2021 school year.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the school
 
sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete a
ll work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to record inspection results.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by 
the School Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are reviewed monthly by the Sch
ool Site Council.  Each 
staff member is assigned a specific responsibility in the event of an eme

Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular basis so that all students and staff are familiar with emergency 
procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campu
s in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy regarding campus visitors
 
is enforced by requiring 

A visitor sign
-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visitors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all ga
tes remain locked during the 
school day,
 
so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health and safety, in both for
m and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect a
ll students while they are at 
sch
ool. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency managem
ent, and public health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance wi
th Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to critical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency a
nd Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles and responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimu
m requirements for 
school and site plans throughout th
e District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
I
t also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
