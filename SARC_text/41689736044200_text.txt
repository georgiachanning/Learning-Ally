School Description
 
Green Hills is a warm and nurturing school community. Staff, parents, students, and 
community 
members work together to provide a diverse group of 359 students the best possible educational 
experience. Our school enrollment increases annually and there is high public interest toward 
enrolling in our school. Although we have consistently de
monstrated high performance on 
standardized testing and annual report cards, our community is especially proud of the exceptional 
accomplishments of the students developing as whole individuals, with sense of school and 
community pride. We have a dynamic s
taff dedicated to the achievement of all students. We have 
a strong and active parent community who enrich the school program by volunteering time to 
provide supplemental art and science programming. Green Hills is a school where everyone works 
towards mee
ting the expectations of a rigorous school program despite the budget and financial 
challenges our school has faced in recent years. Our most recent facility improvements include the 
addition of two additional portable classrooms to meet our increasing stu
dent enrollment. We also 
completed the second phase of modernization work made possible by Measure N school facilities 
funds. Highlights from the summer modernization work included: ADA accessible path
-
of
-
travel, 
ADA staff and student restrooms, ADA doors,
 
frames & hardware, ADA reception and library check
-
out counters, wheelchair lifts, HVAC upgrades, fire alarm system upgrades, Local Area Network 
(LAN) upgrades, wireless capabilities and wireless thermostats.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Califor
nia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational age
ncies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data rep
orted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/a
c/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Green Hills was built in 1949 and was remodeled in 1990. A computer lab was first estab

2001 and upgraded with current technology in Spring 2008. Additionally, classroom teachers received computers and use them fo
r email communication 
with colleagues and parents, data entry and asse
ssment, researching, and word processing. The school is equipped with wireless Internet throughout 
the campus, and 16 classrooms are using SMART Board technology and document cameras. District maintenance crews and school cu
stodians refinished 
the hardwood
 
floor in the multiuse room and dusted and cleaned all classrooms and bathrooms, which were upgraded and  remodeled in the sum
mer 

h
ave set a goal of keeping 
every classroom and restroom clean and safe despite cutbacks, budget reductions, and decreased maintenance staff. During the 
summer of 2011, the 
school received major upgrades that made the campus ADA compliant, including a remode
led driveway with handicap accessibility to the main office 
and classrooms. The fire alarm system was replaced, along with new roofing and conduits on all buildings. This was made possi
ble with money from the 
Measure X bond passed in May 2009. The upper an
d lower fields were renovated, and a new play structure was built on the yard. During the summer of 
2013, our school completed the second phase of facilities modernization work made possible by Measure N school facilities fun
ds. Highlights from the 
summer 
modernization work included: ADA accessible path

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement 
(Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Green Hills School enjoys a history of positive relationsh
ips among schools, parents, and community members through open communication and shared 
decision
-
making. Each year, a televised board meeting features our Green Hills school report and highlights student activities to show
 
the many positive 
projects in whi
ch children are involved. An active PTA organization coordinates volunteer activities at the school, which include daily clas
sroom volunteers 
and school events and activities. Some activities are designed as fund
-
raisers; others are appreciation events or 
community pursuits. The Green Hills PTA 
actively supports educational programs by sponsoring our Annual Fund. This direct ask sponsors 100% of our school supplies, f
ield trip costs, technology 
enhancement, music assemblies, and a family picnic/campus beaut
ification day. Decision
-
making is shared at our school. There are advisory groups that 
meet throughout the school year, including the ELAC and the SSC. During kindergarten through fifth grade parent conferences, 
teachers inform parents 

academic, social, and behavioral progress. Informal conferences can be scheduled throughout the year. Progress reports are se
nt to 
parents when children are experiencing academic difficulty. The SST (Student Success Team meeting) which includes students an
d parents, meets to 
discuss and plan for student success and achievement. Report cards are issued three times each year.  Progress reports are se
nt home only when needed. 
Parent education is a high priority in the Millbrae School District. It is important 
to keep parents well informed about changes in the curriculum. PTA 
events are planned throughout the year, as well as district parent education programs covering a variety of topics from test
-
taking strategies to interactive 
math games and centers. Parents
 
from all schools are invited to attend. Green Hills School provides an online handbook for each student and family 
outlining expected standards of behavior, a calendar of events for the year, and other essential information. In addition, ea
ch school distr
ibutes a 
newsletter to keep parents informed about current and upcoming activities, including PTA and district wide news. Many teacher
s send frequent or weekly 
updates on class activities and curriculum themes. Much information is posted on the school's ne
wly remodeled Web 
\
site and on a signboard in front 

 
Good communication 
promotes parent involvement and brings a significant amount
 
of parent participation to Green Hills. For more information about becoming involved at 
our school, please call our principal, Mr. Peter Fong, at (650) 588
-
6485.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff and parent volunteers monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all 
recesses and at lunch time. Teachers 
regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground. At the beginning of the school yea
r, students participate in a 
behavior assembly and sign a student rules and safety pledge. Vis
itors must sign in at the office, where they receive a bright badge to wear throughout 
their stay. A regular crossing guard and periodic visits by Millbrae police and traffic
-
control members contribute to the safety of our students, parents, 
and community 
members as they come and go from campus. Families are encouraged to walk to school and follow safety rules for crossing stree
ts. 
Emergency preparedness is a high priority in the Millbrae School District. Each school, in collaboration with the Millbrae Po
li
ce Department, has 
developed and implemented a School Safety Plan that provides emergency response  and procedures in the event of need. Green H
ills School has regular 
fire, lockdown and earthquake drills along with district wide emergency drills in which 
local Sheriff and Fire Departments participate. Additionally, Green 
Hills School has  partnered with a local high school, Cappuccino High School to ensure that Green Hills staff and students ha
ve a safe, and well provisioned 
facility off site for relocatio
n if the need should ever arise.  The Green Hills Safety Plan was last revised in October 2019 and was approved during a wint
er 
school advisory council meeting. The Green Hills Student and Parent Handbook outlines key elements of the plan. The handbook 
is 
accessible on the 
school website, and is referred to by the principal at various school meetings.
