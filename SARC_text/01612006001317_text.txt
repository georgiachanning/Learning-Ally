By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Marylin Avenue Elementary School serves
 
approximately 400 students in grades TK
-
5. There are 19 general education 
classroom teachers and three special education classes, plus more than 30 specialists and instructional assistants. Marylin 
Avenue is considered a neighborhood school with close tie

Professional Learning Community that holds students to the highest academic and social standards. Teachers and parents 
share our mission, vision and values. Our school community is defined by collabo
ration and collective inquiry. The staff 
have created a highly effective leadership team and have successfully implemented a process of reform that includes 
examining best instructional practices, effective school characteristics, and using data to institu
tionalize systematic 
change. Because of this reform process, student achievement continues to increase. Three books and several professional 

 
 
Marylin Avenue is a place where parents and 
teachers turn aspirations into action and visions into reality. In November 

for continuous school improvement. In June 2010, another boo

upgrade by providing each student in grades 3
-
5 a Chromebook laptop. The school ut
ilizes these computers to enhance 
lessons by implementing blended learning, flipped classrooms and collaborating with students using Google Apps for 
Education. Students in grades K
-
2 share five carts containing 32 Chromebook laptops, with which they learn 
how to 
develop keyboarding and mouse navigation skills as well as research, practice math and reading skills, create 
presentations, and compose essays. Students in grades 3
-
5 use these devices on a daily basis, while K
-
2 grades utilize the 
computer carts o
n a shared schedule for developing similar skills. Two years ago, we opened our Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Art and Math, STEAM Lab through the support of various grants. Students have the opportunity to 
collaborate, investigate and engineer in order
 
to create various projects from robotics, videography, sewing, and coding. 
We are in year three of being a Leader In Me school where students and staff focus on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective 
People. Students create personal and academic goals.  This ye

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Marylin Avenue School was built in 1958 and has recently been remodeled. In addition to 25 renovated classrooms, offices, 
and a multipurpose 
room, Marylin Avenue has a media center, computer room, and two science classrooms.
 
 
Also housed on the Marylin Avenue campus, are six portables used by adult education and four preschool classes, including 
a migrant education preschool.
 
 
During school hou
rs, the Marylin campus is closed, and visitors enter and check in at our office in the front of the school. 
A new entry was installed during the Summer of 2019 to further secure the entry of visitors and volunteers. Staff members 
monitor playground, lunchr
oom, and crosswalks in front of the school to ensure the safety of each child before and after 
school.
 
 
Two years ago, we installed solar panels on our playground, providing shade for students and solar energy for our school. 
We are in the process of insta
lling new playgrounds at the back of the school and the kindergarten playground as part of 
the Measure J Bond. Security cameras and lights were installed during the 2018
-
19 school year.
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore have passed three major funding measures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous an
d supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond.
 
 
Measure J funds will be used to:
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs and educational technology for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and elect
rical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated
 
hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to school facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities
 
Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize 
and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan.

Facilities are maintained through the diligent efforts of the site custodial crews and the district maintenance staff. The 
LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all sch
ools in the LVJUSD. The principal works with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to maintain clean and safe schools. District maintenance staff performs the 
repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely manner. A wor
k
-
order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant 
to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education p
opulation and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
ar
e aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy
 
the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Educational research s
uggests that highly effective schools have a number of features in common, including high levels of 

high levels and have more well
-
rounded
 
educational experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school 
community. There are a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activ
ity booster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Information Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportu
nity for parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information 
with parent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Commit
tees (ELACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Adviso
ry Committee, and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, an
d school staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Marylin Avenue has a full community service model of supporting students and family needs. Through the food bank, 
families can receiv
e free groceries three times a week. Our Parent Resource Center provides workshops and links families 
to low

or no
-
cost medical and dental care. There are multiple family events that are funded annually to engage family 
participation, such as the Back to 
School BBQ, Parent Institutes, Thanksgiving Turkey Feast, Spring Ice Cream Social, Leader 
in Me Parent Engagement classes,  and End of Year Community Celebration. Our community liaison facilitates classes for 
families on a wide array of relevant topics. We
 
invite family participation in our Site Safety Committee (SSC), English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) and Family Volunteer 
organizations. To facilitate communication with families, bi
-
weekly updates
 
are sent to families, email and phone blasts 
to families for special events and announcements and conferences are held with families twice a year to report student 
progress. Our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) has reorganized to better support the stude
nts at our school. For more 
information on how to become involved, please contact Danielle Wyckoff, PTO president at MarylinPTO@gmail.com.

Marylin Avenue School, in conjunction with the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District, provides our students with 
a welcoming campus that is clean and in great condition. Staff, students and 
parent volunteers are proud of our campus. 
There are murals, cozy meeting areas, a garden with livestock, and a welcoming parent center.

In addition to a campus that is welcoming, our staff and parents continually monitor ways in which we can maintain our
 
positive environment. Through programs and activities such as monthly safety drills, student valet parking; anti
-
bullying 
and drug
-
 
and tobacco
-
prevention programs, our students know about positive lifestyles and are encouraged to follow 
them. Parents are
 
encouraged to volunteer at school and must sign in and out through our electronic check in system that 
prints each volunteer a badge.
 
 
Our Marylin Safety Committee met and revised our plans for disaster and emergency situations to create a comprehensive 
s
ite plan. Our Site Safety Committee meets every other month and the whole staff reviews and suggests improvements 
to the plan annually. Our students receive training in fire, earthquake and lock down drills on a monthly basis. The staff 
review their jobs a
nnually and receives training as needed. Cameras have been installed to monitor happenings 
throughout the school 24 hours a day.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty in October 2019.
