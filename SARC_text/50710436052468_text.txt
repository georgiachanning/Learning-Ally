By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Westport Elementary is a wonderful K
-
6 school located in the California Centr
al Valley. It is one of the fourteen elementary 
schools in the Ceres Unified School District.
 
 
We believe the mission of Westport School is:
 
 

 
Welcome every student
 

 
Encouraging a love of learning
 

 
Specializing in meeting individual needs
 

 
Teaming up with our 
community
 

 
Promoting perfect attendance
 

 
Opening the door to the future
 

 
Reaching the CA State Standards
 

 
Teaching is our passion!
 
 
Westport Elementary School is located nearly 10 miles from the City of Ceres and is in the Ceres Unified School District.  
The s
chool is one of the smaller of the fourteen elementary schools in the district but pulls from the largest area.  All 
students are eligible to ride the bus to and from school.  We have one principal, 20 certificated teachers, one library media
 
clerk, one fu
ll
-
time paraprofessionals, four part
-
time paraprofessionals, a 20% nurse, one full
-
time health clerk, one 60% 
speech and language pathologist, one administrative assistant, one community liaison and three office secretaries.  Upper 
grade receives Music and
 
P.E. teachers two days weekly and primary receives PE once weekly.  The school has 22 
classrooms, a library, and a large multipurpose room.  The school year consists of 180 instructional days with seven 
minimum days for parent conferencing and three for s
taff development.  The students are in school for 310 instructional 
minutes a day.
 
 

large part of our population comes f
rom an unincorporated area in South Modesto that is eight miles from the school. Of 
the approximately 425 students, 91% of the students receive free or reduced cost for breakfast and lunch, 65% are English 
Learners (EL's). The ethnic make
-
up approximately 
includes 85% Hispanic, 11% White, 18%  migrant students and 10% 
special education. Approximately, 60% of the parents are not high school graduates, 25% are high school graduates, with 
the remainder having some college or being college graduates.
 
 
Westport 
Elementary School includes a two
-
session  preschool program on the campus, a morning session and an 
afternoon session.  Each serves approximately 25 students per class.  Parent classes are taught on campus.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school 
district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of C
alifornia. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adop
ted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the Schoo
l Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in August, 2019 about the quality,

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is a
 
top priority to the staff, families and students of Westport Elementary. The safe school plan is revised each year 
with the input of both staff and the School Site Council. Data is collected on school safety through annual surveys to 
parents, students and
 
staff. Surveys are administered each fall and the safety plan is revised by March of each year. The 
last School Safety Plans were revised and approved on 1/30/19.
 
 
Westport Elementary takes a proactive approach in encouraging positive student behavior thr
ough our Westport Way 
initiative.
 
 
Safety drills and procedures are practiced on a monthly basis. Annual education in drug & alcohol awareness is provided 
by staff during Red Ribbon activities.
 
 
In addition, Westport prides itself in having clean, safe and
 
maintained facilities. Westport is annually in the running for 
top facilities in the district and last received this honor in May 2015.
