About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sc
hool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements
 
Twin Oaks Elementary opened in 1998 with 700 students, and we now have approximately 720 students. We stagger our lunch perio

on
 
the playground. Our 3 playgrounds have been rebuilt with new floors throughout the school.  Our school includes seven buildin
gs and eight portable 
classrooms. Together they accommodate approximately 830 people. We have 32 classrooms, a multipurpose room, 
a library, and an administration 
building. The facilities are in excellent condition and are maintained by a dedicated custodial staff.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the school office 
and at the district office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning s
chedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure e
fficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

San Marcos Unified School District (SMUSD) is committed to the belief that the strongest predictor of 
student achievement is the quality of the teacher 
inside the classroom. In support of this belief, SMUSD is deeply committed to teacher learning and professional development a
s evidenced by our district 
mission statement. 
 
 
San Marcos Unified School Distri

 

 

 

 

 
Every new
 
teacher in our district engages in a rigorous 2 year training program where the new employee receives 30 hours of professiona
l development 
on our research
-
based instructional framework, the Essential Elements of Instruction (EEI). These instructional stra
tegies apply to any curricular area and 
any grade level. New administrators to the District receive professional learning in this instructional framework as well. 
 
 
In the 2018
-
2019 school year, the elementary level focused professional learning on the con
tinued implementation of state academic standards in English 
language Arts (ELA), English language development (ELD) and mathematics. Our district ELA/ELD leadership team received traini
ng in Tier I literacy and 
ELD grounded in formative, summative assessm
ents, and differentiated instruction. Our Math cadre teachers received on
-
going professional 
development in math instruction and assessments. Teacher grade level leaders received support to deepen their understanding o
f effective Professional 
Learning Comm
unities (PLC).
 
 
Various means of professional learning were offered: face
-
to
-
face workshops during the regular work day, during school breaks, after school as well as 
online sessions available for staff. Principals and ELA/ELD and math teacher leaders prov
ided staff development during regularly scheduled staff meeting 
throughout the year. Teachers who work with students with special needs engaged in ongoing collaboration to implement more in
clusive delivery models.
 
 
Teachers continued to engage in professio
nal development each week as they worked collaboratively during their structured teacher collaboration time 
(early release Wednesdays for elementary/middle school staff and late start Tuesdays for high school staff). This provided te
achers the opportunity 
to 

rked with teachers in 
their classrooms modeling strategies, planning collaboratively, and providing support.
