Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Chinese Camp School has two classrooms, a multipurpose room, and a library/office. The facility strongly supports 
teaching and learning through its ample cl
assroom and recreational space. The most recent facilities inspection was 
completed on 10/1/19.
 
 
Custodial staff ensure that classrooms, restrooms, the multipurpose room, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. 
Classrooms are cleaned on a daily basis. 
Twenty minutes of custodial time per room allows for trash removal, vacuuming, 
and a light cleaning of boards. More thorough cleaning takes place during the summer.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner.  The Maintenance and Operations Manager assigns tasks to the crew according to 

cond
itions. Facility inspection reports are presented to the Board of Trustees and maintained in the school district office 
for review.
 
 
Recent completed maintenance projects included repairing uneven concrete, installation of a new playground, gutter 
repair, 
and clearing of debris.  Maintenance projects scheduled for this school for the 2019
-
2020  are a complete repair of 
the cement sidewalk at the campus entryway, repair and painting of main building, and repairs on the retaining wall in 
front of the playgrou
nd. Through a recent drinking water grant, new drinking fountains and filters for interior water 
fountains will be installed.

he Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only e
ligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); an

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Paren
tal Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are an important part of 
Chinese Camp School. The small size of the school means that most parents know one 
another. They contribute ideas, participate in special activities, and help with field trips. Parents volunteer for special 
events, represent Chinese Camp on the Site Counci
l and communicate frequently with teachers through personal contact 
and email. Every special occasion or event at Chinese Camp School fills the house with parents, families, and community 
members.
 
 
A number of community members also help at Chinese Camp Sc
hool. The school garden benefits from the assistance of 

passion for science with the children through the TOPS program. Students have al
so benefited from experiences provided 
by the Tuolumne River Trust and the Audubon Society.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC p
rovides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
