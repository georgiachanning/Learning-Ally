School Description
 
Wagner Ranch Elementary School continues in its commitment to inspire students to academic 
excellence within a community that fosters respect, responsibility, cooperation, acceptance, 
perseverance, honesty, empathy, courage, and a positi
ve attitude. Our goal is to prepare students 
for life in the 21st century. Our focus is to build vital knowledge and develop skills that enhance 
creativity, critical thinking/problem solving, collaboration, communication, and curiosity for 
motivating a lif
elong love of learning.
 
 
Wagner Ranch has successfully implemented instructional techniques and educational programs 
that are well aligned with Common Core Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. Our 
staff is deeply involved in ongoing training th
rough Columbia Teachers' College Reading and Writing 
Project, Silicon Valley Math Initiative Training, and U.C. Berkeley Lawrence Hall of Science BaySci 
Project. This dedication and training, has led many staff members to serve in leadership positions 
with
in the district. In addition to the training outlined above, the District provides extensive training 
to support instruction in math, English language arts, STEAM, technology, and social emotional 
learning. Administration, staff, and parent groups analyze 
data from a variety of measures to 
develop our School Site Goals and action plans.
 
 
The CAASPP assessment results from spring 2019 confirm the exceptional job that Wagner Ranch 
and OUSD have done with implementing CCCS curriculum and methodologies. On this
 
exam, 90% 
of our students tested "met" or "exceeded" grade level standards in ELA/Literacy. 70% of our 
students tested "exceeded" the standard. In Mathematics 90% of our students tested "met" or 
"exceeded" grade level standards. 64% of our students who we
re tested "exceeded" the standard.  
In Spring of 2016 Wagner Ranch was designated as a Gold Ribbon School and in 2018, Wagner 
Ranch was named a California Distinguished School based on the signature practices of our science 
program. In 2019, we received th
e Recycle Smart Leadership Award in recognition of our successful 
waste reduction practices.
 
 
Wagner Ranch Mission Statement
 
The Mission of Wagner Ranch Elementary School, in partnership with our staff, families and 
community, is to inspire each child thro
ugh educational excellence, diverse enrichment experiences 
and mutual respect, to a lifetime of learning and the creation of a better world.
 
 
With the continuing development of our alignment to the California Common Core Standards 
(CCCS), the Wagner staff 
has been fully engaged in collaborating to develop lessons and align all 
instruction to meet the rigor and depth of knowledge expected by the CCCS. Learning is often 
project based and includes the use of technology. In the classroom, teachers and specialis
ts use 
ongoing assessment and differentiation to adjust their teaching methods to meet the needs of each 
student. Our before and after school program provides students opportunities for building peer 
relations, indoor and outdoor activities, a host of enri
chment classes, and a homework club which 
is run by a credentialed teacher.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://ww
w.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Orinda Union School District (OUSD) convenes textbook committees to help in the selection process. The textbook committees co
nsist of teachers and 
administrators in the
 
District. State
-
approved books are reviewed, piloted, and a selection is made based upon pre
-
determined criteria. The books go on 
public display for two weeks and are then presented to the Governing Board for adoption. The district has affirmed that class
 
sets or electronic versions 
of textbooks are available to all students, including English learners.
 
 
At the middle school level, class sets or electronic versions are also purchased to eliminate the need of students carrying h
eavy books. Books have been 
p
urchased for all core academic areas as well as visual and performing arts, and music, at all grade levels. Textbooks are Cal
ifornia Department of 
Education
-
approved and California Standards
-
based.
 
 
A public hearing is held each October and reports are mad
e quarterly to the Governing Board to meet all requirements according to the Williams 
Settlement Agreement.

School Facility C
onditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Buildings: Wagner Ranch is a beautiful campus nestled among the trees and hills of Orinda. The campus adjoins the Wagner Ranc
h Nature Area on one 
side and the Orinda sports fields on the other. The scho
ol includes 11 buildings, four of which are portables. In addition to 20 grade TK
-
5 classrooms, we 
house a Special Day Class, an art room, music room, science lab, innovation lab, literacy room, resource room, computer lab, 
specialist offices, and a 
librar
y.
 
 
Wagner Ranch Elementary School was built in 1969. After being closed for several years in the 1980s and 90s it reopened in 19
97 with a completely 
renovated campus. Numerous repairs, upgrades, and minor additions have occurred since then.
 
 
In 
August of 2015, the Orinda School Board set aside a portion of the Wagner Ranch Nature Area as a garden area dedicated exclus
ively for use by our 
school. Multiple enhancements have been made to create learning spaces, educational activities, planters, and 
other such accouterments within our 
garden area. We employ a part time garden aide who facilitates instructional activities for each classroom, maintains the gar
den, and hosts students 
during recess and lunch periods.
 
 
In the summer and fall of 2016: The e
ntire exterior of the school was painted. AC cooling units were installed in every classroom. Solar arrays were 
erected and made functional. A solar kiosk monitor was placed in the library for science and math studies. Our kindergarten p
layground was redon
e with 
a significantly larger footprint to accommodate increase enrollment at this grade level. Our southern parking lot was reconfi
gured and completely 
renovated. An upgrade was done to our WIFI system. Proposition 39 energy efficiency measures including 
LED & T8 lighting and occupancy sensors were 
installed.  New LED canopy lighting installed in 2019.

In the summer and fall of 2017 new play structures were added to the primary playground including a climbing net and a climbi
ng rock along with other 
play 
elements. The wood fiber chips under the play structures were removed and replaced with poured
-
in
-
place rubber surfacing. The hillside along the 
entry driveway was re
-
engineered in reaction to a major winter mudslide. A new electronic marquee was installed
 
replacing an old announcement sign. 
Shelving was added in most classrooms and storage cabinetry in the hallways. State of the art security cameras were installed
 
throughout the campus.
 
 
In summer 2018, a new 10,000 gallon water tank was installed as a wil
dfire safety measure and two of our pods were enhanced through interior painting. 
We enhanced security by adding a mirror window application to classroom windows that do not have curtains and by equipping cl
assroom doors with a 
magnetic strip which block t
he latch and allow doors to remain in the locked position while still enabling easy ingress and egress during typical operati
ons.
 
 
During the 2018/19 school year we created an Innovation Lab which is used on a regular basis by students at every grade 
level to enhance science 
instruction and to provide STEAM based activities. During the summer we completed painting the interior pods and shored up a 
second section of our 
hillside. We also replaced aging fencing on our primary playground.
 
 
We are currentl
y restoring our sports fields by filling cracks, aerating, over seeding, and fertilizing to address drought damage.
 
 
We believe that the physical quality of our school buildings influences learning and teaching. We strive to maintain and impr
ove our school
 
site and 
facilities at Wagner Ranch. Our two regular custodians, with the support of the District maintenance staff, take pride in mai
ntaining the cleanliness and 
safety of our school site.
 
 
The library, at the center of our campus, includes a collection 
of 12,000 books, magazines, and videos/DVDs. Each class visits the library on a weekly 
basis. Here students are read to by our library technician, learn library and research skills, and check out books. The libra
ry is open during lunch recess 
for 4th and 5
th grade students who use this opportunity to study, socialize, enjoy quiet activities, or check out books. We share our mult
i purpose room 
with the City of Orinda. Students use this room for lunch, physical education, school gatherings, performing arts, a
nd after school for community sports. 
The stage area is equipped with a lift to facilitate handicap access.
 
 
Computers/Technology: Age appropriate technology is readily available for our students. In grades TK 
-
 
2, we have iPads in every classroom at a 1:2
 
ratio 
of devices/student. At grades 3 
-
 
5 we provide use of a Chromebook for every student. In addition we have over 50 MacBooks on carts and a computer 
lab with 20 iMacs.   Classroom computers and those in our lab are networked, allowing students to work
 
on assignments in both settings. All classrooms, 
the art room, and the science room use interactive white boards and document cameras to enhance instruction. The OUSD Technol
ogy Coaches and 
technical support team enable Wagner teachers and staff to make o
ptimum and efficient use of our technological devices.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school dis
trict and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our school takes pride in the active parent involvement that is ever present within our school and district. The Wagner Ranch
 
School Site Council is 
composed of six pa
rent members, including a representative from the Parent Club Executive Board, the Educational Foundation of Orinda (EFO), an
d our 
Special Education Community, four teacher members, a classified staff member, and the school principal. The Site Council deve
lops the annual School 
Improvement Plan and approves the school budget. The school plan is developed through a process of determining site and distr
ict goals based on a 
review of student data, as well as faculty and parent surveys and input.
 
 
All Wagner Ra

nts work in 
our classrooms, school library, and the lunchroom. Parent volunteers assist with: field trips, the school garden, outdo
or education, physical education, 
as Think First instructors, and with special class projects and celebrations. The Parents' Club supports invaluable services 
such as the hot lunch program, 
our before
-
and after
-
school care facility, our after school homewo
rk club, and a variety of enrichment programs. Last year parents helped establish and 
run our Green Team, which, along with other measures, has greatly reduced waste with our hot lunch program. This year parents
 
have initiated a Wagner 
Ranch Community Coal
ition to help us celebrate our diversity and foster a greater sense of inclusivity. Parents' Club leaders include 11 executiv
e board 
members and more than 40 parent leaders who act as liaisons and committee chairs. The ongoing support of our Parents' Club 
provides the funding for 
many programs that benefit Wagner Ranch students. Events such as International Kindness Day, Maker Faire,  Walk
-
a
-
Thon, Parent Education Nights, 
Auction, Movie Nights, Coffee Connections, and Round
-
Up bring our community together b
oth for fun and in support of school priorities. Wagner Ranch 
parents also provide input into the Local Control Accountability Plan and other school and district initiatives through schoo
l and district stakeholder 
meetings and parent school surveys.

State Priority:
 
School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Wagner Ra
nch School Safety Plan addresses the physical, social, and emotional safety of all members of our community, and crucial aspe
cts are 
reviewed annually by the School Site Coordinating Council as well as our staff. The School Safety Plan was last reviewed an
d updated in February of 2019. 
The plan can be viewed in the school office. A parent education night, featuring Dave Winnacker the Chief of Moraga/Orinda Fi
re Department, took place 
in January 2019 to discuss emergency preparedness in the areas of wild fir
e and earthquakes.
 
 
At Wagner Ranch, maintaining a safe and orderly environment in order to maximize student learning is a top priority. Each yea
r we work with the Parents' 
Club volunteer Emergency Preparedness Coordinator to ensure that the emergency supp
lies stored in our emergency container and in classrooms are 
up to date and easily accessible when needed. Wagner Ranch has specific plans and procedures for natural disasters and emerge
ncy situations. Our 
monthly fire drills, as well as periodic evacuatio
n, shelter in place, and secure campus drills, provide important practice opportunities for staff and 

 
 
Students in Kindergarten through 5th grade re
ceive training using the Think First/Second Step Character education program. This program gives students 
strategies for better understanding themselves and dealing with personal issues such as anger, problem solving, improving pee
r relations, and recogniz
ing 
and standing up to bullying. All students benefit from our KidPower student empowerment program which teaches students skills
 
that enable them to 
avoid, negotiate, or maintain control in difficult social situations. In the 2019/2020 school year we have
 
initiated training with the Anti
-
Defamation League 
in an effort to reduce or eliminate ingrained biases and increase our ability to include, support, and celebrate all members 
of our community. A number 
of our students benefit from the services of a part 
time, on
-
site mental health counselor who works with small groups on strengthening key social skills.
 
 
All Wagner staff receive annual Mandated Reporter Training. In addition, the District Nurse provides annual health training f
or all staff members. Topics
 
include: recognizing and responding to head trauma, seizures, asthma, and allergic reactions, treating wounds, use of EPI pen
, and effective universal 
precautions.
 
 
All guests and parents visiting or volunteering at Wagner Ranch are required to sign in at
 
the main office and to wear a visitor badge.  All staff members 
are expected to wear their photo ID badges while on campus. All parent volunteers must complete a TB test before working in t
he classroom and those 
volunteering on overnight trips or as drive
rs on field trips undergo a background check. Members of our staff monitor campus playgrounds 20 minutes 
before school starts, during recess, and at lunch. Staff members and our student Safety Valets monitor our drop
-
off and pick
-
up area every morning and 
afternoon. All parents are educated on and asked to follow our traffic flow procedures to ensure the safety of our children a
nd other drivers.
