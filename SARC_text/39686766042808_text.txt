School Description
 
Victory School is a Preschool through 8th grade elementary 
school located in Stockton, California 
in San Joaquin County. The school serves over 500 students on a campus with 28 classrooms, 
library, resource rooms and a science lab. In 2014 the school was modernized, completely updating 
the interior of the school, 
including all classrooms, offices and multipurpose room.  We created a 
new library to be used by all Kindergarten
-
8th grade students. The property also has three 
basketball courts, a baseball/soccer field, and an extensive playground with tether
-
ball, voll
eyball, 
slides, bars and other activities for students to enjoy.
 
 
Our staff is committed to working with the educational community to provide all students with the 
opportunity to reach his/her potential.  Together, we collaborate and make a difference for 
our 
students.  The staff at Victory School is very dedicated to providing the best possible educational 

educational and emotional needs.  Our teachers deliver
 
instruction using Common Core State 
Standards adopted by Stockton Unified School District and the State of California.  The staff works 
diligently to implement rigorous curriculum and monitors student progress on a regular basis.  
Academic intervention an
d small group instruction are provided for students who are not meeting 
grade level standards through our Learning Center.  Available to all students are reading and math 
interventions using computer based programs: ST Math, Imagine Learning and Compass Le
arning.  
For academically advanced students and GATE level students, enrichment curriculum activities are 
embedded into daily instruction and lessons.
 
 
Victory students also benefit from a variety of programs to meet individual needs after school.  Our 
aft
er school program, which runs until 6:00 p.m. daily, provides our students with additional 
academic tutoring, as well as physical activities in a safe and structured environment.  Victory 
currently has a full time Assistant Principal, full time Program Spe
cialist, full time Resource 
Specialist Program teacher, full time Instructional Coach, one and a half counseling position plus 
one position as a half time counselor and half time School Psychologist, an 80 percent Speech 
Therapist, and 3 Â½ hours a day of a
 
Library Media Assistant.  We encourage a site visit for anyone 
interested in learning more about Victory School and the educational opportunities that await 
students.
 
 


 
Our vision is to provide a safe, caring, disciplined and stim
ulating 
environment where children will achieve their fullest potential so they can make their best 
contribution to our world. We value our school community and recognize the role it plays in 
realizing our vision.
 
 


 
Our mission is
 
to empower students to reach their highest potential, 
inspire academic and behavioral excellence, and encourage members of the school community to 
participate in our endeavor.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Calif
ornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational a
gencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data r
eported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov
/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those bo
oks are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
