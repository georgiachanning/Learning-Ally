Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Madison ensures that each student reaches his/her highest potential and is on target to become college/career
-
ready in 
a global society by preparing them academically and by ensuring their well
-
being at school.   In order to accompl
ish our 
mission, we engage students in learning through research
-
based instructional strategies , with state
-
adopted standards, 
board
-
adopted materials, and through individualized learning goals.
 
 
Madison identifies with the description of being a high
-
ach
ieving, high poverty school.  During the No Child Left Behind 
era, Madison was one of the very last Title 1 schools in the County to go into "Program Improvement."  We continue to 
achieve well above average on State tests despite the high percentage of fam
ilies who qualify for free lunch in our school 
community.
 
 
Madison is planning to enter into a large facility modernization project beginning in 2018 which is expected to provide 
updated permanent classrooms and  buildings to the campus.
 
 
Madison's teacher
s and principal participate in a Shared Leadership project in which they have identified the common 
focus of citing evidence as a necessary step in meeting our literacy, numeracy, and English Learner learning targets. Every 
month, teachers at all grades co
llect data using a "cycle of inquiry" process to measure our progress in citing evidence.
 
 
Seven success indicators are used to measure our progress in meeting our goals: Attendance Rates; Reading Rates in Third 
Grade; Early Numeracy; ELA SBAC Results; Mat
h SBAC Results; and English Learner proficiency.  The School Leadership 
Team monitors these data points and plans programmatic and instructional responses in order to increase student 
achievement. Teachers monitor their students' progress and collaborate e
very Wednesday afternoon to plan instruction 
based on adopted standards.
 
 
School
-
wide, Madison has one
-
to
-
one Chromebooks, as well as presentation systems for every classroom that includes a 
large
-
screen TV monitor.  In addition, Madison offers 
Breakfast in the Classroom to ensure that all students have eaten 
breakfast every day.  Other unique aspects of the school include a Fall Festival, Sixth grade science camp, a monthly Kids 
Produce Market, numerous field trips, band in 5th and 6th grades, a
nd a Head Start preschool.
 
 
For students with special needs, Madison has a Speech/Language patholo
gist, a Resource Teacher, as well as Special Day 
Classes from first to sixth grades.  In addition, two different part
-
time counselors are available to work with students 
individually or in small groups.  A Student Study Team meets regularly to monitor the 
progress of students who are not 
meeting regular benchmark expectations.  Counselors teach restorative practices school
-
wide, during class meetings, to 
help students learn to work through situations such as playground conflicts.
 
 
Madison implements a Posit
ive Behavior Intervention System that rewards students for demonstrating social skills and 
for being responsible, respectful, and ready to learn.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Madison offers many opportunities to participate with the staff as partners in the education of their children. Parents and 
guardians are invited to atten
d all parent meetings at the school. The School Site Council meets monthly and is the voting 
body for categorical programs. Everyone is invited to attend these meetings and participate during the Oral 
Communications portion of the agenda. The English Langu
age Advisory Committee meets a minimum of four times a year 
and is the advisory committee to School Site Council. The purpose of this committee is to give voice to the parents of 
Academic English Learners and to inform them of the importance of attendance,
 
information on the school plan, to report 
on student progress including the R30 report (showing progress on the English Learners in the school), and a needs 
assessment (what additional information they are interested in learning about the school).  Title 
1 meetings are held for 
parents to review program information and to seek their input regarding programs that support learning.
 
 
At Madison, parents with limited English skills are provided opportunities to improve their knowledge of and ability to 
speak E
nglish using computers and apps that the school provides. The school offers ESL classes to support parents who 
are learning English.
 
 
In coordination with a community partner, Madison is offering monthly financial literacy workshops for parents in English 
and in Spanish.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to take an active role in their child's education through volunteering in their child's classroom, 
ongoing communications with the school, and attending all parent meetings and parent workshops.  Parents are 
encourag
ed to call or email their child's teacher to increase communication about their child's progress. The most common 
method of contact between parents and teachers is through messaging apps such as Class Dojo.  Progress on every child 
is discussed at parent/t
eacher conferences in the fall.  Progress reports and report cards also provide regular formal 
updates to parents regarding student progress.

Madison employs an instructional coach to support teachers in the area of language arts, math and ELD.   The coach 
provides support to teachers in their respective content area to enrich 
instruction for students.  In addition, the coach 
attends many workshops and conferences to further help teachers reflect and improve their teaching skills. The 
instructional coach also meets with teachers during team meetings, and during planning time. Th
e coach also supports 
the the principal in analyzing student achievement data and planning for the academic achievement of all students, paying 
particular attention to students who are not making adequate academic progress, as well as, monitoring English L
earners 
and GATE students.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, all staff members at Madison school participated in site and district staff development 
training such as a full day of Positive Behavior Intervention System using Boy's Town resources. Many of the
 
staff members 
and teachers will participate in other workshops and professional development that is appropriate for their grade level or 

udes 
many instruction
-
related topics. Some trainings are offered during the school day and others are offered after school. 
Madison teachers at our site will be attending these trainings. Our teachers will have at least 2 days of training provided 
by the d
istrict for professional development in the their grade level content provided by the staff developers from the 
district. The teachers will receive two days of training at the school site for instructional planning with district speciali
sts. 
The teachers m
et with the staff developers in each subject area to help them work on the standards, lessons, units of 
study and planning. Teachers work closely together throughout the year with their grade level colleagues to develop 
lessons and plans to meet the needs 
of their students based on the assessments that are given throughout the year. During 
the 2019
-
20 school year, all Madison teachers participated in numerous trainings and workshops including the following 
topics: Eureka mathematics curriculum, Danielson pe
dagogy inservice, Suicide prevention and awareness, Child abuse 
prevention and awareness, and Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support.

All staff members at Madison participate in staff development training at least twice per month.  Staff development is 
facilitat
ed by the principal, the instructional coaches, and district support staff. Some topics covered in staff development 
meetings include effective instructional methods, instructional room environment, vocabulary development, the writing 
process, learner enga
gement, implementation of the math and language arts program and vocabulary for English Learner 
students. A rigorous district
-
wide professional development plan is in place to provide regular support for teachers in 
advancing their knowledge of the Common 
Core State Standards.  Many staff members participate throughout the year 
in professional conferences, trainings and workshops that are appropriate for their individual needs.  The principal 
supports teachers' professional development by providing class re
lease time for professional development and 
instructional conferences to review their own professional progress with them.  Depending on the grade level, subject or 
school focus, teachers participated in 3 

 
10 days of professional development.
 
 
During the
 
2017
-
18 school year, staff meetings focused on the content area frameworks  and the  RUSD Guide for 
Instructional Direction.  We examined our three local LCAP goals and the success indicators that will help us measure our 
progress in meeting those goals. 
 
In addition, we took measured steps in the Guide to identify what the Mastery of 
Guaranteed Learning should look like at each grade level.  We focused our effort to support teachers and teams of teachers 
to provide best initial instruction, but also targe
ted and intensive instruction as needed.  We emphasized the role of 
focused collaboration that engages students in rigorous and engaging learning experiences.  And finally, our staff meetings 
developed the idea of whole system engagement such as building p
ositive relationships to ensure focused learning in the 
classrooms.
