A Message from the Principal
 
Cerritos Elementary, located in the city of Cerritos, serves 
approximately 672 students in grades 
kindergarten through six on a traditional calendar system. Recognized as a California Distinguished

All students receive weekly time in the computer lab, library, and music class.  Students are offered 
extra
-

as they can be. We are a 
school committed to all our students and value our strong partnership with our parents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school
 
in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educ
ational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionall
y, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.c
de.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
commu
nity members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to th

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction 
with the focus on student learning.  Staff development 
is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel. Staff members work collaboratively to determine the school's needs an
d take direction from 
District and State requirements when establishing prof
essional development goals for the school year.  Staff members build teaching skills and concepts 
by participating in conferences and workshops throughout the year and by sharing their experiences and knowledge with colleag
ues. The District's 
professional 
development in 2017
-
18 focuses on English Language Arts and Math. In the last few years all teachers received in
-
depth professional 
development on the California State Standards with emphasis on text
-
dependent questioning, academic vocabulary, writing from
 
sources and 
mathematical practices.
