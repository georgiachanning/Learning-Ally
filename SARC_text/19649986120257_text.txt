About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

Professional growth activities are planned annually at both the district and site level based on current needs and input rece
ived from staff.  Workshops 
on professional effectiveness and classroom skills focus on the California Standards and the effectiven
ess of explicit direct instruction.  Teachers, classified 
staff, and administration work collaboratively during instructional planning times to meet the diverse needs of our students.
  
Grade levels are provided 
additional collaborative planning time during
 
the school day on a weekly basis.  We are proud of the results we have accomplished as a staff!
