About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The district instructional material evaluation committee
, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopte
d courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians 
and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
pt
ion. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In s
ome instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

The SARC provides the following

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 20

-

Parent Participation is an integral part of the educational program at Matsuyama Elementary School. Parents are active partic
ipants in the decision 
making process via the School Site Council (SSC), the English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), Gifted
 
and Talented Education (GATE) Advisory Committee, 

d to nearly 500 
members.  The Matsuyama PTA sponsors fundraisers such as the Fam
ily Dance, Harvest Festival, and Cherry Blossom Festival. The Matsuyama Mighty 
Men organization is a group of fathers that provide man
-
power for all school events and activities. The funds raised by the PTA support our Extended 
Day Enrichment Programs such
 
as Band, Orchestra, Robotics, Drum Line, Chess, Mad Science, art classes, as well as classroom activities/materials and 
educational school
-
wide assemblies.
 
 
Parents are strongly encouraged to attend Back

n about the grade level Common Core Standards, the 
curriculum, classroom rules and procedures, and expectations for the school year.  We encourage parents and the school commun
ity to attend the annual 
Harvest Festival, Cherry Blossom Festival, and other sc
hool community events.  Open House is held each year in the spring.  Parents, friends and family 
are invited to come and visit the school and classrooms to see student work proudly displayed.  Parents, grandparents, aunts 
and uncles participate in a 
monthl
y "Lunch with a Leader" . The school recognizes that parents play an important role in motivating their children to succeed. 
 
Parents, adult family 
members, and community members are encouraged to be directly involved in learning at school.  Fingerprinting
 
services are offered three times a year 
at the school to encourage community involvement. Volunteers spend countless hours assisting in the classroom, chaperoning on
 
field trips, supervising 
students on the playground, mentoring in the classroom, etc. Stu
dents receive "brag tags" for parent involvemnt and student participation in school 
activities.
 
 
Good communication with our families is important to us.  Parents receive regular communication through REMIND, Infinite Camp
us messages on the 
telephone, clas
sroom notes /newsletters, Facebook and a well
-
developed school website.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
