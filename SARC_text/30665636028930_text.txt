School Description
 
On behalf of the students and staff at Arbolita Visual and Performing Arts Academy, it is a pleasure to provide 
you with information about our school. We were named a California Distinguished School and Title I 
A
chievement School for 2014, only 3 other schools in Orange County were similarly recognized. The staff is 
committed to providing our students with a safe, stimulating, and positive learning environment. Our teachers 
work closely in grade
-
level teams to pla
n meaningful instruction based on the Common Core State Standards. 
It is our goal for students to become lifelong learners who are responsible citizens, fluent readers, problem 
solvers, and effective communicators.
 
 
Every teacher at Arbolita
 
Elementary School is committed to quality education in all content areas, including 
the Arts. Our staff considers building partnerships with parents to be a high priority. We encourage all of our 
parents to be involved in our classrooms, PTA, School Site 
Council, English Language Advisory Committee, and 
more. Please come and visit us! We would love for you to meet the Arbolita Team!
 
 
Our teachers meet weekly in Professional Learning Communities (PLC) to set goals based on standards, 
develop assessments for
 
each goal, and discuss ways in which to support students not meeting goals. They 
share strategies for best practices, look at student work, and plan instruction for future learning.
 
 
To maximize student achievement, we differentiate our reading instructio
n to provide support and extension 
to students reading at a variety of levels. This differentiated reading time provides each of our students an 
opportunity to achieve high levels of reading success regardless of their ability level. Students are evaluated
 
to determine their current levels in reading. Teachers meet together to scaffold the students, plan progress 
monitoring and plan interventions. Support personnel is utilized to support this process. The scaffolding 
method provides support to students as t
hey learn a concept, then the support is removed as students achieve 
competence. Small group instruction is also used in math to ensure students are meeting grade level 
standards.
 
 
Last year, our school became the Visual and Performing Arts Academy for the
 
district. We have a piano lab, 
music/choir teacher, band instruction, visual arts through Art Masters, Disney Musicals in Schools, 
opportunities for participation in performances and much, much more.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
Federal Title I and Local Con
trol Funding Formula Supplemental and Concentration funds support low
-
income 
students and help pay for school support staff, including a library technician. In addition, these funds pay for 
instructional aides who work with teachers and small groups of stu
dents to improve learning opportunities. 
We also use these resources for materials and supplies for our classrooms, library, and computer lab; for 
translators for parent conferences; and for parent
-
involvement activities. We also use these funds for a part
-
time counselor for our students. Our PTA raises funds for field trips, assemblies, and programs through our 
annual catalog, book fairs and catalog fundraisers.  These funds help us buy more books for our library as well.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school 
in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educa
tional agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally
, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cd
e.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Each year the District looks at student achievement data along with 
teacher requests for specific trainings to determine the plan for the four 
Districtwide professional development days.  In 2017
-
2018, training 
focused on new English Language Arts adoption
s, Wonders and Amplify.  
In 2018
-
2019 training focused on new Mathematics adoptions, Bridges and 
Math Links.  In 2019
-
2020, training focused on developing Multi
-
Tiered 
System of Supports (MTSS) and iReady training.
 
 
In addition to the Districtwide training
s, each site works with a consultant 
from InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry around their strategic focus.  
Teacher leaders attend seven days of training to analyze student data, 
develop a strategic focus for the year, implement evidence based lessons
, 
and analyze student work.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) 
assigned to each site work with all teachers throughout the year during the 
school day and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic 
focus. At Arbolita, our teachers also 
have the option of attending several 
arts
-
focused trainings throughout the year and summer.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district 
makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to ke
ep our programs running smoothly. Parents can 
join our School Site Council (SSC) and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) to work with administration to help make fi
nancial decisions. All 
parents of our students are vital to our advisory committees. 
We hold Open Mic with the Principal meetings four times a year to provide a public forum 
for disseminating information and responding to questions. We also have a community liaison who provides parents with several
 
opportunities to become 
involved in their
 
child's education. These opportunities include parent education classes, volunteering opportunities, and other parent leaders
hip 
activities.
 
 
Room parents help our teachers with special projects in the classroom and serve as chaperones on field trips. Our PTA members
 
help with activities 
throughout the year such as: Buck a Book, Red Ribbon Week, Fall Family Fun Nights, Holiday Family Fun Night, 
Family Reading and Math Nights, Holiday 
Gift Shop, Arbolita Arts Festival, book fairs, the annual color run, performances, and more. We ask all parents to attend Bac
k
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, 
Open House in the spring (Arbolita Arts Festival), and paren
t conferences in October and February. We appreciate our parent volunteers, and are always 
looking for more ways to help our parents become more involved. Please contact our principal for information.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to t
he State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

Staff members monitor the school grounds for 30 minutes before school as well as all r
ecess and lunch times and after school. Teachers regularly review 
the rules for safe, responsible, and respectful behavior in school and on the playground. We have a closed campus that is ful
ly fenced. Visitors must enter 
the school through the main office
 
and sign in. Using our new automated system, parents receive badges to wear throughout their stays on campus.  
Furthermore, we are a PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports) school that strives to promote safe and responsible
 
school behavior th
rough 
positive incentives, clear behavior expectations and specific behavior supports needed for our students to succeed.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually; it was last revised in October, 2019. The plan includes procedures for emergencies
, exit routes, and supplies. 
This plan is shared with our staff, School Site Council/Advisory and Information Committee, and Englis
h Language Learner Committee. It is also available 
in the office for review. We currently house a three
-
day food and water supply for our students and staff in the event of an emergency. We practice 
regular fire, lock
-
down and earthquake drills throughout 
the year to review the procedures that would keep our students, staff and families safe during 
an emergency. In addition to our School Safety Plan, we have a Safe Schools Action Plan. Included in this plan are our missio
n statement, school narrative, 
and g
oals regarding people and programs at Arbolita Visual and Performing Arts Academy.
