By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Montague Elementary is located in north Santa Clara in the heart of Silicon Valley's Golden Triangle. The east side of the
 
 
schools attendance area is adjacent to north San Jose. Approximately 90% of the dwellings are single
-
family 
homes built 
in the 1960s. The remainder are apartments and some newly constructed condominiums.
 
 
The median income of families feeding into the school ranges from homeless to middle class. There is a large percentage 
of single parent families, working moth
ers, two working parents, and extended families living together. The majority of 
parents work in skilled and semi
-
skilled professions. To meet the needs of these working families, Montague offers an 
after school extended day program serving students after 
school in Kindergarten through 5th grade and though Prop 49 
the YMCA serving students in grades 1 
-
5 from 2:31
-
6:00 PM daily.
 
 
Montague serves grades preschool through fifth. It opened in 1962 with twelve self
-
contained classrooms and no 
cafeteria. In 1968
 
the campus almost doubled in size with the addition of eleven classrooms. A cafeteria, complete with a 
stage and kitchen, was built in 1968. Four additional portable buildings were added in 1997 to accommodate the 20:1 
ratio in third grade and then anothe
r three were added in 2003 to accommodate growth in the area. This brings the total 
to thirty self
-
contained classrooms. The entire school site, including underground electrical and plumbing, was modernized 
in 2004. Within the self
-
 
contained classrooms, M
ontague houses a state preschool, a community preschool comprised of 
1 full cost full day and 1 full cost 1/2 day preschool, (1) K/1 SDC class, (1) 2/3 SDC class, ( 1) 4/5 SDC class, 1 Extended 
Day 
Program, 2 computer labs, 1 English Language Development/R
eading Improvement Classroom, 1 Speech and Language 
classroom, and 1 Resource Specialist classroom.
 
 
One of the characteristics of Montague is its diverse population. Our school has for many years experienced what many 
of California's schools are now exper
iencing: the challenge of educating linguistically and culturally diverse students. We 
consider this a strength, as our students have enjoyed a living microcosm of positive intercultural relationships. Of the 
approximately 380 TK
-
5th grade students, the an
nual language survey shows that more than 40% of our students speak a 
language other than English at home. Having a student population that collectively speaks 17 different languages shapes 
our instructional program. The two dominant languages spoken by ou
r children are Tagalog and Spanish. Also, we have 
witnessed an increase in the number of students who speak Korean and Chinese. To meet the needs of our diverse student 
population, Montague School uses a variety of instructional methods. Two computer labs,
 
classroom computers and 
tablets, and a library media center further enhance the delivery of instruction. A school
-
wide structure for language 
vocabulary instruction is implemented and adhered to as much as possible. Translators provide additional services
 
at 
parent/teacher conferences, parent workshops and school meetings, and most school communications are translated into 
Spanish.

The staff provided through district funding include: one full
-
time principal, fifteen classroom teachers, three 
self
-
contained 
Special Day Class teachers, seven paraprofessional special education assistants, one RIS Reading Specialist 50%, one 
English Language Development Specialist Teacher 50%, one full time Resource Specialist teacher, one Resource Specialist 
para
professional, one 50% psychologist, one 100% Speech/Language Development Specialist, one Physical Education 
specialist, one 50% library/media specialist, one 10% nurse, one full
-
time secretary, one part
-
time office assistant who 
also serves as the school's
 
English Language Assessment Technician, one 20% health aide, two custodians, and four noon 
duty aides. The library and resource/media center houses materials and equipment used to help coordinate the learning 
goals and objectives for the comprehensive sch
ool program, including the regular program, the Title 1 School
-
wide 
Program, the English Language Development Program, and the Resource Specialist program. Materials include those 
purchased with District, Title 1 and State Compensatory Education Funds.
 
 
In
 
addition to the wide variety of materials, Montague's success is also defined by cooperatively planned program 
improvement and staff development. The staff has two leadership teams that guide all of the staff, students, and 
community. One, the Guiding Coa
lition, leads the staff in collaboration and assuring that all students learn at high levels. 
The other leadership team guides all the students to be responsible, respectful, and safe and follow the positive behavior 
support program at our school.
 
 
The sta
ff is committed to using the collaborative process for planning. Montague will continue to focus on improving the 
reading and mathematics program offered at all grade levels. Staff meet regularly in curricular groups, grade level teams, 
and cross grade lev
el groups to assess student work and analyze data to plan accordingly. Many teaching and assessment 
strategies were developed and piloted as a result of this ongoing, collaborative effort. The staff is committed to sharing 
its own expertise in all these ar
eas, and to learning new ideas and strategies together. Release time is scheduled for peer 
observation and collaboration.
 
 
Finally, our staff has pledged commitment to our students who are judged to be "at risk." Ongoing collaborative 
interventions are provided throughout the school. An Extended Day program (SOAR) for selected Title 1 students in some 
grades is also provided. We also continue to focus on attendance and tardies, homework responsibility, and social and 
emotional well
-
bein
g. When held accountable, all those factors will most likely benefit one's academic success. Currently, 
the staff is working on revising its Mission and at the same time determining its Vision, collaborative responsibility, and 
collective commitments.
 
 
Mon
tague's Current Mission Statement:
 
"The Montague staff and community develops lifelong learners who reach their fullest potential academically and 
socially."
 
 
Montague's Current Vision Statements:
 
A Place to Learn and Grow: Each child will be valued for wh
at he/she brings to our school community. Each student, 
teacher, and staff member will contribute to a school environment emphasizing a sense of belonging and high 
expectations for learning and behavior. Children will be assured that their learning will be
 
supported. Our school will be a 
safe and respectful place for children's personal well
-
being, ideas, and feelings.
 
 
The Ways We Teach and Learn:
 
Our instructional strategies and learning goals will be guided by state/district standards and systematic and 
varied 
assessments with clear high expectations of achievement for all. We will employ a variety of instructional strategies and 
tools to develop skills and to instill enthusiasm for learning.
 
 
What We Teach:
 
We will provide a rich curriculum through which
 
students can explore their diverse talents and interests. We believe that 
teaching literacy and mathematics are the primary purpose of our school. We are dedicated to developing fully literate 
and mathematically strong students: strong readers, listeners,
 
writers, speakers, problem solvers, and critical thinkers. All 
children will be challenged to meet and surpass rigorous grade level standards and beyond.

The Ways We Work:
 
We will create a stimulating, supportive and respectful work environment where l
ife
-
long learning is valued and 
opportunities for professional development are provided. We believe that communication systems and collaboration 
among professional staff result in more effective and efficient instructional practices.
 
 
Foundations for Learn
ing:
 
Parents are the child's first teachers. We know that a child who is well supported by his/her caretakers and the school will 
be the most successful as a learner. We will employ as many strategies as we can to develop partnerships with parents 
and othe
r community members and agencies.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. T
o 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the
 
State of California OPSC. The results of this 

-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
on
line at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to as
sist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort to spend taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facil
ities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in updated technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science clas
srooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambitious roof 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle
 
schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and security systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and
 
expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews campus, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classroo
ms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging play structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.or

Age of School Buildings
 
Montague houses grades preschool through fifth. It opened in 1962 with twelve self
-
contained classrooms and no 
cafeteria. In 1967, the campus almost doubled in size with the addition of eleven classrooms. A cafeteria, comple
te with 
a stage and kitchen, was built in 1961. Four additional portable buildings were added in 1997 to accommodate the 20:1 
ratio in kindergarten through third grade at that time, and then another three more were added in 2003 to accommodate 
growth in th
e area. This brings the total to thirty self
-
contained classrooms. The entire school site, including underground 
electrical and plumbing, was modernized a few years ago. Within the self

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are the 
child's first teachers. We know that a child who is well supported by his/her caretakers and the school will 
be the most successful as a learner. We will employ as many strategies as we can to develop partnerships with parents 
and other community members o
r agencies. Parents can be a part of the school PTA, School Site Council and ELAC. Parents 
are encouraged to become a Montague Volunteer and help in the children's classrooms and with school activities. Other 
school wide events that are well attended by fa
milies include Back to School Night, Open House, the annual Walk
-
a

thon, 
Winter Performance, Spring Concert, Montague Market, Family Math Night, Family Literacy Night, Science Fair Night, 
Family Bingo Fun, and Movie Nights. Parent Education workshops are h
eld on topics such as Positive Parenting, Project 
Cornerstone, and Supporting Academics and Homework to develop the importance of connecting children with adults. In 
addition, Montague School supports a weekly E.S.L. class with childcare so parents can hav
e the opportunity to learn 
English, and will be developing an evening homework center to help parents in understanding how to work with their 
children at home. Also, to support the diversity of Montague, PTA will be sponsoring a multi

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All 
California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals and actions to
 
improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a safe, 
responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills and attitudes inc
luding resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the School Site Council
 
in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in 
self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development oppor
tunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the
 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practic
es, cognitive development and learning disabilities, and best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, an
d instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicated to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 schoo
l 
year, and eight days of professional development in the 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while as
sessing student work.
