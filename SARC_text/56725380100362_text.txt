School Description
 
Mission:
 
Thurgood Marshall School inspires students to reach their highest potential.
 
 
Vision:
 
Thurgood Marshall School creates and maintains a culture of success. Through the mediums of 
technology, visual and performing arts we inspire students to reach their highest potential and 
become leaders in their community.
 
 
Thurgood Marshall School was est
ablished in 2003 and is one of 21 schools within the Oxnard 
Elementary School District. The school prides itself on its foundation of rich culture and values.  Our 
classes include Deaf and Hard of Hearing, our Children's Academy of Listening, Language and 
Learning, and Visually Impaired special programs. Thurgood Marshall just completed construction 
of the new middle school building and is currently rolling up students to 7th grade.  By the 2020
-
2021 school year, Marshall will have a complete grade span of 
TK
-
8th grade.
 
 
Thurgood Marshall is the Academy of Visual and Performing Arts.  Students are exposed to a variety 
of art mediums and opportunities for music as well as drama.  The school strives to provide a culture 
of success and continues to afford oppor
tunities for students to achieve academically in all areas.
 
 
Grade level meetings and student monitoring conferences are held to track student progress and 
plan strategies to address student needs. Teacher collaboration is a priority and teachers meet on 
a
 
regular basis to review data and plan instruction.  Designated and integrated ELD instruction 
follows curriculum included in McGraw Hill for language arts and mathematics and other curricular 
subjects. Additional programs are used in order to provide our 
students with various learning 
opportunities. The Accelerated Reader (AR) program helps all students to hone their 
comprehension skills and encourage a love of reading. The online myON program and Battle of the 
Books supports reading progress for students.
 
Lexia Core 5 supports our students with intervention 
and enrichment in reading support. CAPIT is used in Kindergarten to help students achieve literacy 
on grade level. Technology is utilized by all classes for research, and use of software programs allow 
students additional time to practice and develop their skills in reading and mathematics.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Opportunit
ies for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Thurgood Marshall School benefits from an active parent community that works together to support student learning in numerous
 
ways.  Teachers host 
Parent Teacher conferences up to two times per school year
, and as needed.  Parents are encouraged to participate in our PTA, English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council.  PTA sponsors fundraisers that support student enrichment and specific aspects of t
he school program.  School 
Site Counci
l offers involved parents the opportunity to discuss and to give input on decisions affecting the school program.  Community 
representatives 
share on topics of interest at regular ELAC parent meetings.  Back to School Night and Coffee with Parents are othe
r opportunities for parents to receive 
information about their child's school program.  Also, parents are active in school events such as Family Nights, Open House,
 
and student performance 
events. Parent workshops focused on Mathematics, Language Arts and 
Science are offered.  Parent trainings are planned and offered on topics such as 
nutrition, safety and parenting.
 
 
Every year in May, a school wide Spring Fling showcases performances in music and dance from every grade.  Parents and visito
rs can tour the 
Art Gallery 
to see exemplary art.  Selected student writing from our Ventura County Author's Fair are displayed.
 
 
Additional opportunities for parents to be involved are found in volunteering.  Parents volunteer in classrooms, at school ev
ents, coaching at
hletic teams 
and they participate in fundraising efforts.  Our local Foster Grandparents Program brings volunteer grandparents to our scho
ol.  They assist in primary 
classrooms, mentor students, and to contribute to our student
-
focused, nurturing environme
nt.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Marshall School. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the offi

all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during break
s, at lunch and after school. Our Positive Behavior 
Intervention System (PBIS) Team sets guidelines in continuing to work together to develop our school wide student behavior pl
an.  Supervision is a 
responsibility shared by all staff which includes Campus 
Assistants, Teachers, Support Staff the Principal and Assistant Principal.  The CHAMPS program 
supports students to develop responsibility by following common expectations that lead to success.
 
 
A comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by
 
the Safety Committee, comprised of classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The 
Safety Plan is updated annually; all revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff.   Leadership and the Safe
ty Committee give input to 
review and update
