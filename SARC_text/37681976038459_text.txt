School Description
 
Highlands Elementary School has served generations of Spring Valley families dating back to the 

through sixth grade and  is a whole

Highlands is proud to be a part of the nation

setting high expectations for each of our students and remain focused on creating a safe, supportive 
learning environment where all students can be su

students see their learning through the lens of a growth mindset and learn to persevere through 
challenges.
 
 
Highlands staff is highly dedicated and passionate about using the very best teaching strategies and 
resources and is committed to implementing the Professional Learning Communities model and 
mindset.  Staff collaborates on a regular basis within and betwe
en grade level teams, and as a whole 
staff; attends a variety of district and site based professional development opportunities; and is 
eager to implement research
-
based programs that focus on specific student needs. Staff uses 
technology to support learni
ng and student engagement, and is trained on how to best incorporate 
technology into classroom instruction. Students are guided  in discovering their strengths, values, 
and interests in order to help them find their own best pathway to college and/or caree
r.
 
 
Highlands provides a wide array of academic support programs for children who require special 
assistance in mastering academic standards. Our Specialized Academic Instructors serve 
approximately 80 students, and our speech and language pathologists wor

on a regular basis.  Our before and after school programs extend the learning day for students in 
need o
f academic interventions, homework help and/or time on computers.
 
 
Higher level thinking activities and extensions are also in place for our students who are excelling 
and moving beyond proficiency. Students can qualify for the Program for Acceleration, Ch

and Enrichment (PACE) as early as 2nd grade and receive instruction from a PACE trained teacher.

students and small groups needing social skill development.  Highlands is al
so dedicated to SEL 
through the use of the Sanford Harmony curriculum.
 
 
Highlands Elementary School takes pride in creating a safe environment where students are 
engaged in using high level thinking skills as they master California State Standards.  Our Hi

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pub
lish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepar
e a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consisten
t with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information a
bout the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school princip
al or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

Professional learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a c
ommon language around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards throug
h the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experi
ence, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face p
rofessional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
based
 
instruction, Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can u
se to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
With
 
professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that
 
it is relevant, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to 
analyze student data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
 
 
The district offers workshops and multiple
-
day seminars, after
-
school workshops, online courses, and one
-
on
-
one coaching and modeling. Select teachers 
also 
attend conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing pr
ofessional development 
at site learning days and staff meetings.
