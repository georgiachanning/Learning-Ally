By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our school rating was 
exemplary based on the last FIT.  We recently put in additional walk ways, and took out a few trees 
that were close to foundations.  Our water system was upgraded in 2017 by connecting to the Hillview Water System.  The 
school site and district worked toge
ther to develop a prioritized list of items to replace or repair in the coming years to 
ensure that our site is well maintained and safe.  The  district replaced our aging phone system with a new state of the art 
system that is expandable to include bells 
and alarm system.  We have contracted to install irrigation and grassed areas 
where dirt currently exists.  The district replaced the gym floor that was in need of repair.  We are constantly working to 
improve our site.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed annually. It was approved by the Board of Trustees at their November meeting.  OCI 
keeps an emergency binder in the office that details the safety plan and provides information to first responders 
including 
electrical and water shut off information and keys to all buildings.  Safety is discussed at staff meetings and shared with 
students at our PBIS rotation schedule on the first day of school.  Safety is discussed with students at  quarterly princi
pal 
talks.  Safety drills are conducted monthly.  The district safety plan is constantly updated.  The district purchased Catapau
lt, 
a safety communications system that allows us to account for all students in case of an emergency. Catapault makes 
communic
ation easy during a crisis and will help to keep our campus safe.

The District's and the school's adopted mission statement both guides and drives the actions of Oak Creek  Intermediate 
School. Regularly scheduled meetings involving site and 
district leadership allowing maximum communication resulting in 
the alignment of site level policies and practices with the mission and goals of the District. To ensure collaboration among 
those who will support our students and our families, Oak Creek Int
ermediate School maintains necessary committees 
that meet regularly to coordinate varying ares of program responsibility. Membership on these committees includes site 
administration, certificated and classified personnel, parents and community members. Add
itionally, Oak Creek 
Intermediate involves parents, certificated personnel, and classified staff members to serve jointly on the school site 
council, where they process the creation, evaluation, and revision of programs that further the mission statement o
f both 
the school and the District. The SSC annually reviews the school site plan in terms of effectiveness in providing all student
s 
the opportunity to achieve high standards.
 
 
We provide services for math and reading intervention as well as EL services. 
 
The district also provides a mental health 
counselor and a behavior IA to assist our students that are in need of those services.
