School Description
 
Myra Linn Elementary School is 
located in the northeastern region of Riverside and serves students 
in grades transitional kindergarten through five following a traditional calendar.
 
 
This School Accountability Report Card represents just one of the many ways we have of 
maintaining commu
nication. Please take a moment to review this information in addition to the 
monthly newsletters and other communications sent home.
 
 
At Myra Linn Elementary, student achievement and learning continue to be our number one 
priorities. Our primary goal is to
 
provide each student with a relevant, rigorous curriculum based 
on the California standards. We believe each and every child can achieve academic success. To this 
end, every child is provided with quality instructional experiences, which recognize, suppor
t, and 
maintain high expectations for all students, both academically and socially. As we continue to work 
with students academically, they are assisted in making connections to their future. Students are 
challenged daily to begin the process of forming a 
character that reflects integrity and 
responsibility. Most of all, students are challenged daily to "Never Settle for Less Than Your Very 
Best" 

 
our school's motto. We are proud of our school community and our accomplishments in 
"setting goals for the fut
ure".
 
 
Myra Linn's Mission is to continuously strive for a comprehensive and equitable framework, which 
includes all stakeholders to make data driven decisions to address ALL students' needs (academic, 
behavioral, and social emotional) through differentiat
ed instruction and learning
 
 
Theory of Action: 
 
 
If we work collaboratively to create a framework to develop systems to differentiate learning/ 
instruction...
 
 
If we are willing to analyze data to guide instruction...
 
 

 
 
.
..Then we will build and improve a comprehensive and equitable framework for all our students 
 
 
Alvord Unified School District, a dynamic learning community that embraces innovation, exists to 
ensure all students attain lifelong success through a 
system distinguished by:
 

 
Active and inclusive partnerships
 

 
Relationships that foster a culture of trust and integrity
 

 
High expectations and equitable learning opportunities for all
 

 
A mindset that promotes continuous improvement
 

 
Multiple opportunities for e
xploration and creativity
 

 
Professional development that promotes quality teaching and learning
 

 
Access to learning experiences that promote a high quality of life
 
In addition, all schools strive to attain the Alvord vision that all students will realize the
ir unlimited 
potential.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Note: Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced 

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e.,
 
achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this c
ategory is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the 
number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using o
nly students who received scores.
