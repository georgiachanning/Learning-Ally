By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Westlake Elementary School is located in Daly City, California north of John Daly Boulevard in a small, safe and friendly 
neighborhood. It is one of fifteen schools in the Jefferson School District. Westlake is an exciting
 
community of students, 
parents, faculty and volunteers. We are a strong, richly diverse community that exemplifies a broad world view. The 
Westlake community strives to challenge, support and inspire each student to reach for personal academic excellence.
 
We encourage our students to take risks, wonder, explore, imagine and embrace all learning opportunities. Teachers 
provide an enriched and challenging environment where students engage and strive to excel in the Common Core 
Standards to become critical th
inkers, curious innovators and creative problem solvers so that they are prepared for 
college with the 21st century skills required to succeed. Westlake School provides a high quality education in a safe and 
nurturing environment where each student demonst
rates a spirit of respect, responsibility and commitment to academic 
and civic excellence.
 
 
Currently, 167 classroom teachers provide general instruction to an enrollment of approximately 375 students in grades 
from Preschool through fifth grade. The suppo
rt staff consists of: one Principal, one secretary, one attendance clerk, one 
full time Intervention Teacher for English Learners, one 80% Intervention Literacy Teacher, one half time special education 
resource teacher, two special education instructional 
assistants, one speech therapist, one half time library clerk, one half 
time psychologist, one part time nurse, one day and one night custodian, one full time physical education aide, two part 
time physical education aides, two noon duty supervisors and a 
half time counselor. The ethnic composition includes: 
Arabic, African
-
American, Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Burmese), Brazilian, East Indian, Filipino, 
German, Hispanic (from numerous Latin American countries), Pacific Islanders, and Sovi
et Union to name a few.
 
 
Westlake School offers after school programs to meet the needs of students and families. Most students live within 
walking distance of the school and the majority of parents work outside the home during the day. We offer before and
 
after school fee based extended care beginning at 7:00 AM until 6:00 PM. Think Together, another after school enrichment 
program provides math, reading, science and health activities after school from dismissal to 6:00 P.M. for no fee to 
parents.  Parents
 
have the option of paying for enrichment programs such as Bricks for Kids, Mad Science and Mandarin 
Class. These programs provide  academic and enrichment activities.
 
 
Parent involvement is highly valued and encouraged at Westlake School. Parents are part
icipants in all aspects of the 
educational program. Attendance at Back to School Night, parent conferences and Open House is good. Parents regularly 
assist with classroom activities by volunteering in a multitude of ways around campus. Parents participate 
in School Site 
Council, English Advisory Council, PTA and monthly principal coffees. School events, parent workshops, classroom 
volunteers, family nights, book fair, field day, ice cream social, our annual walk
-
a
-
thon, and a welcome back pasta dinner 
are a
 
few of the activities that traditionally promote parent involvement and enhance the educational experience for our 
children. We welcome new ideas for participation.
 
 
The SARC is available on the district website at www.jsd.k12.ca.us and can be made availa
ble in hard copy upon request.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Westlake School was built in 1952. Each year the school district makes any needed repairs to maintain a safe facility. In 
addition the site is cleaned and maintained by the District's custodians and grounds workers. Over t
he next five years all 
of the schools in the district will be modernized. A list of planned projects is available at the district office. All classr
ooms 
in the school have internet access including the library/computer lab. Students have access to a large 
playground and 
upper field during recess and physical education times.
 
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
conducted every year. The most recent inspection was conducted in August 2018. Additional information about the 
condition of the school's facil
ities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Children do better in school when families are meaningfully involved in educational activities. With this in mind, parent 
involvement is important at Westlake Elementary. Parents and staff work together to plan school events and activities. 
Processes and p
rocedures are in place that provide opportunities for parents to volunteer and participate in school 
activities and receive information about their child's education.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Westlake works to provide a safe environment for students and staff. We maintain a detailed Comprehensive Safe School 
Plan that outlines information around protocols, systems and procedures in the event of an emergency or disaster. We 
follow the San Mateo 
Coalition for Safe Schools and Communities Guideline, The Big Five. Staff members and School Site 
Council review and update the plan annually. A copy of the safety plan is available in the school office and was last 
reviewed in 2019 at a staff meeting and 
at School Site Council. Fire, earthquake and disaster drills are regularly conducted. 
The Daly City Fire Department conducts school assemblies every October to educate students about fire safety. Westlake 
has a regular visiting community police officer. Ou
r school is identified as a designated shelter by the Red Cross should an 
emergency occur. The administrator participates in safety sessions with the police department to update the safety plan. 
We are a participating Safe Routes 2 School and encourage fam
ilies to walk, carpool or park a distance away and walk for 
health and to protect our environment.

Westlake School is committed to maintaining a safe, caring environment for students, staff and volunteers. Consistent 
expectations is essential to providing
 
a positive learning environment for students. The goal of our positive behavior 
program is to provide children with the opportunity to learn self control and respect for others so they can become 
responsible citizens in the future. The children are guided
 
by specific expectations that promote the positive character 
traits of respect, cooperation, courtesy and acceptance of others. Students and parents are informed about our expected 
behaviors throughout the school year through notices, assemblies, or paren
t nights. Westlake is in year three 
implementation of Positive Behavior Intervention Systems (PBIS). This is a set of expectations for positive student 
behavior. All students participate in monthly assemblies that outline the expectations of how to be Peac
eful, Aware, Wise 
and Safe. Our school adopted a set of expectations for positive student behavior that applies specifically to our school. 
Westlake School has a conflict resolution program in place and students participate in Peace Assemblies through Kais
er 
Permanente and Soul Shoppe. A positive, no bullying playground ensures that all students are included and if there is a 
conflict it will be resolved by talking and the use of the Peacepath. Students are taught to express their feelings and to 
clearly co
mmunicate through discussion instead of using physical action to solve a problem. Physical Education aides, 
noon duty supervisors and a Playworks Coach promote safe play through fun, inclusive games so that all students feel 
valued and included on the play
ground. Students demonstrate leadership skills by participating as Junior Playworks 
coaches or Junior Peacemakers. These model mentors support positive behavior among their peers in the class and on the 
yard. A half time counselor provides Second Step clas
sroom lessons so that all students are supported. Students learn 
appropriate social interactions through active learning and play; they are carefully monitored throughout the day. Our 
after school Think Together Program is aligned to the school day; they f
ollow the behavior expectations, encourage 
respectful citizenship and active participation in Math, Language Arts and Science. Parents are active participants and 
frequently volunteer and/or participate in PTA, Principal Coffees, Parent Project Class, spec
ial school events, activities and 
in the classrooms. All visitors are required to register at the office before being allowed on campus.

District and school professional development programs provide 
numerous opportunities to enhance skills and gain new 
teaching strategies. All staff development activities are tied to district and school goals. Westlake School has focused staf
f
