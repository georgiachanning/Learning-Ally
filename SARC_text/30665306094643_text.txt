School Description
 
Hawes School is a Learning Community 
--
 
where all participants 
--
 
students, staff, and parents are 
responsible for learning. We share the commitment that ALL students succeed in a 
rigorous 
curriculum. The following vision/mission is our foundation in creating a safe, friendly, and joyful 
learning environment.  WE BELIEVE that, with strong home and school support, all students can 
successfully acquire the skills needed to become life
long learners. WE BELIEVE in a school climate 
that is built upon a foundation of teamwork collaboration, and mutual respect among all groups. 
We are a professional learning community. WE BELIEVE that an environment that supports risk
-
taking, creativity, an
d openness to new ideas and technologies is essential to our vision of success. 
WE BELIEVE that positive self
-
esteem and a strong sense of social responsibility are goals for every 
student. WE BELIEVE that students will love learning and be challenged to r
each their highest 
potential when their natural curiosity and creativity is stimulated. WE BELIEVE in aiming for the 
remarkable. We will set ambitious goals and strive to achieve them. The hawk's flight symbolizes 
our vision for children... to soar, to exp
erience joy and freedom, and to apply strength, grace, and 
a keen eye to a noble purpose.
 
 
Dr. Ralph E. Hawes Elementary School, a high performing California Gold Ribbon School 2015, 
serves students in Pre
-
K through 5th grade.  This year our school facilit
ies completed construction, 
which include enhancing all learning space with 1:1 technology and mobile furniture.  Although we 
are a neighborhood school and many walk to school, approximately 24% of our 586 students are 
on inter
-
district transfers.  As a sc
hool with a strong PTSA, we are able to provide enhanced learning 
opportunities for all of the diverse needs of our students.  At all grade levels, we have classes for 
students with special needs, depending on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP), tha
t include 
full
-
day Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) classes, pull out SAI support, occupational therapy, 
Adaptive PE, speech and language services, social skills training, and counseling.  Additionally, 
beginning in 2nd grade, we provide GATE instruc
tion within cluster classes for eligible students. 
Vocal music instruction is provided to all classes by a credentialed music teacher. Students in grades 
K
-
5 participate in ST Music keyboarding classes each week.  A credentialed PE teacher provides 
physica
l education to students once weekly to allow for small group instructional opportunities 
within the classroom.  Our PTSA offers enrichment opportunities, such as after
-
school programs for 
sports, chess, art, Spanish, and music. The PTSA also provides progr
ams that enrich the daily 
program such as Accelerated Reader (AR), art assemblies and in
-
class lessons, Red Ribbon Week 
Activities, academic assemblies, field trips and more.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
l
aw to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement 
(Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Collaboration, involvement, and support of our 
parents and community are integral to our work at Hawes Elementary School. Volunteers contribute 
more than 20,000 hours of support time during the school day and after school to ensure that all students have a quality expe
rience at Hawes.  Our PTSA 
continu
es to contribute time and resources to numerous programs and activities. This support includes:  a new playground structure o
n the kindergarten 
playground; an electronic marquee in front of the school; funding for field trips and the purchase of instructio
nal supplies; the purchase and 
implementation of the Accelerated Reader program; support and funding for the Pacific Symphony Class Act program; PTA sponsor
ed events such as the 
gardening, assemblies, Red Ribbon Week, Earth Day, school
-
wide assemblies, art
 
assemblies and in class lessons and more.
 
 
Parent volunteers assist and support instruction in the classroom, in the computer lab, with rainy day schedules and activiti
es on the playground, and 
other tasks associated with classroom instruction.
 
 
Classroom
 
teachers have received funding for technology and other instructional materials through Donorschoose.org, the Huntington Beac
h Assistance 
League, and other grant opportunities.
 
 
Local businesses have supported the school program by providing a portion of 
sales to our school. Local businesses include: Kohl's, Corner Bakery, Market 
Broiler, Hambone's Restaurant, and the Skating Center in Fountain Valley.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Pr
iority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The 
plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their safe school plans: 
current status and assessment of school crime; identification of strateg
ies and programs that provide and maintain a high level of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notific
ation to teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimina
tion policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school 
evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, was last
 
reviewed with

20 school year, professional development focused technology integration and first best instruction. Training was focused on: 
implementing our newly installed technology and mobile furniture; developing math fluency school
-
wide; and strengthening our E
nglish Language Arts 
instruction through alignment. Professional development was conducted through the use of district
-
wide professional development days, release time 
to attend workshops/trainings and through staff meeting/Professional Learning Communitie
s (PLC) time.  Through peer assistance and principal support, 
the staff worked diligently to implement math fluency within the classrooms, implementation of TWAGS and usage of technology.
  
Staff supported one 
another in continued growth and implementation.
 
 
The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, i
nstructional materials, 
implementation timelines, and student achievement. Feedback is gathered at the site level through direct 
input and staff observation. Periodic Curriculum 
Development Committees are formed to address identified areas of need and focus. Twenty professional development days were av
ailable and held 
during the school year which involved curriculum based training f
or ST Math, Mimio Studio Notebook, OC STEM Science training, Write from The 
Beginning, Stop the Bleed, and data analysis through Professional Learning Communities. Classified staff and instructional as
sistants are provided training 
and development opportun
ities at the school, district, and county levels. Instructional assistants for special education programs meet regularly to d
iscuss 
best strategies for meeting the unique needs of the students and attended specialized training such as Pro
-
Act. All staff al
so had the opportunity to 
attend and update CPR/First Aid certification.
