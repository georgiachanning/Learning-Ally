Principal's Message
 
Dear Country Club Parents and Students,
 
 

so little, together we can do so much 
-
 

 
I am so honored and excited to be the principal at Country Club. What an amazing school and 
community!
 
 
Country Club has a strong tradition of excellence and community support. These are exciting years, 
as we have the opportunity to partner together to continue to provide a caring environment in 
which each child can feel connected and challenged, feel valued and nurtured, feel empowered 
and safe. I believe in the power of building trusting and long term r
elationships; of providing a 
curriculum that is rigorous and based on the standards, meeting the needs of all learners, and of 

creating an environment where equity
 
is highly valued and our school reflects the students in our 
classrooms and the families in our community.
 
 
I am so thrilled to be working together as a collaborative team with staff, parents, and students as 
we continue to build on the many, many wonderfu
l opportunities that are here at Country Club. 
Thank you to our dedicated parents, staff, and community for your support of the programs here. 
Thank you for sharing your time, talents, expertise, and donations in order for our students to have 
access to th
e skills, support, and technologies necessary to be able to create, collaborate, think 
critically, communicate, and be curious about their world.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Mrs. Christy Glaser
 
Principal
 
 
Mission Statement
 
To accept and empower students so that they have 
the confidence to become their own authentic 
self. To include and unite so that we help build lifelong empathy and acceptance of self and others.
 
 
School Profile
 
Country Club Elementary is well known for its high level of parent involvement and its 
dedication 
to innovative instructional strategies. Staff has implemented technology to enhance learning 
experiences with an emphasis on student access to mobile devices. Our intervention programs 
serve students in need of additional support. We have four L
earning Center (Special Day) classes 
that serve students with mild disabilities. Our culture supports the whole child and a strength of 
our school is the home and school connection.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more inf
ormation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the scho
ol principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University
 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experie
nces are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team 
and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, in
tentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These co
horts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teache
rs are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our
 
Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the di
strict as a whole is enhanced.
