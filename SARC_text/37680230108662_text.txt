School Description
 
Veterans Elementary opened in 2005, serving a K
-
6 population. The school is located in southeast 
of San Diego County in the city of Chula Vista. It is located in an area of new homes and apartments. 
Veterans is about five miles from the U.S./Mexico border.
 
Veterans was the 43rd elementary school 
to open in the Chula Vista Elementary School District. The school has four permanent classroom 
pods, a library media center, an auditorium, and an administrative building.
 
 
We have a very diverse student 
population. Approximately 23% of the students qualify for the free 
and reduced National School Lunch Program. Approximately 20% of the students are English 
Learners, 10% qualify for GATE, 19% are Filipino, and 49% are Hispanic. There are 35 general 
educati
on teachers, 3 special education teachers, 5 part
-
time visual and performing arts teachers. 
We have a full
-
time Associate Principal, a part
-
time Resource Teacher, two Speech Teachers, 2.5 
days/week with a nurse on site, and 4 days/week with a psychologist 
on site.
 
 
The mission of Veterans Elementary is to provide all children with a world class education.
 
 
Veterans Elementary School provides a safe, nurturing, supportive learning environment for every 
member of the school community. We foster the continuous
 
academic and social growth of all 
students by engaging them in challenging, enriching learning experiences that meet their individual 
needs and prepare them for life in the 21st century. This is accomplished by immersing students in 
a Common Cores Standar
ds curriculum, which demonstrates relevance to their lives, provides in
-
depth experiences in all curricular areas and provides a strong foundation for future learning. The 
building blocks of the academic program are commitment, competency, communication, a
nd 
collaboration. Staff members take responsibility for basing instruction on best practices by 
engaging in ongoing professional development through research, reading, and collaboration. 
Teachers are adept at using ongoing assessments and data to guide ins
truction. Emphasis is placed 
on adherence to grade level content standards, ongoing assessment, differentiation, and grade 
level collaboration. Techniques, strategies, and results are shared with parents on an ongoing basis, 
thereby giving parents the oppo
rtunity to be true partners in the academic growth of their children.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Veterans added 6 new classrooms during the summer of 2010. This allows more space to ensure that all students living within t
he area can be placed at 
their neighborhood school rather than being overflo
wed to a nearby school site. Classroom space at Veterans Elementary School is adequate to support 
our school's current enrollment.  There is room for growth in enrollment. The District maintains a planned program, which ens
ures routine maintenance 
function
s are performed on a scheduled basis.  The school custodial staff performs basic cleaning operations daily.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Supplemental and categorical funds are used to enhance the academic program addressing the needs of all students, including G
ATE and English Learners. 
Currently, a GATE certified teacher is employed to work with the students. To increase reading skills, we

ents who need support.  Imagine Learning allows for strategic language support and academic 
language development via one

Imagine Learning wit
h Designated English Language Development (ELD), which take place on a daily basis. We also provide Eureka Mathematics which 
has benefited our students and had a positive impact on our assessment data.
 
 
In the area of arts a physical education, training is
 
provided to the teachers for the Building Better Bodies PE curriculum, and part

staff are being employed to offer opportunities for students to engage in art, dance, drama, and PE every other week.
 
 
A portion of the Limited English Pr
oficient funding is used to pay for an Instructional Aide to conduct the required testing and provide small group 
instruction for students. In addition, the funds are utilized for materials to support ELD (English Language Development), co
mputer tech suppo
rt, and 
support materials to differentiate the instructional program for students.

ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school g
raduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the I
nternet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of soft
