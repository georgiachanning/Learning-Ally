About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
The
 
2019-2020
 
Comprehensive
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
was
 
written
 
by
 
the
 
school
 
administration
 
and
 
approved
 
by
 
the
 
San
 
Marcos
 
Elementary
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
on
 
October
 
24,
 
2019.
 
It
 
was
 
developed
 
and
 
designed
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
working
 
document
 
and
 
to
 
ensure
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures
 
are
 
in
 
place
 
and
 
followed
 
appropriately.
 
Local
 
law
 
enforcement
 
and
 
city
 
officials
 
are
 
regularly
 
consulted
 
to
 
assist
 
the
 
administration
 
in
 
designing
 
safety,
 
disaster
 
and
 
behavior
 
plans.
 
These
 
policies
 
are
 
in
 
place
 
at
 
San
 
Marcos
 
Elementary
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
environment
 
where
 
children
 
feel
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
and
 
have
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
learn
 
every
 
day.
 
 
Three
 
essential
 
components
 
were
