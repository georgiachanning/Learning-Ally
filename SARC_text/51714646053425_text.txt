By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communit
y members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and 
other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation
, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Safety Plan stresses the procedures for ensuring student safety during emergencies. The safety plan was revised on 
August 8, 2019 and was last reviewed with faculty on August 9, 2019. Revisions to the Safety Plan have been made in 
collaboration with In
cident Command System for Schools (ICS 4 Schools).  Members of the crisis team met with staff from 
ICS4Schools in December 2018. The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous 
materials and state earthquake standa
rds. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student 
and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, earthquake, and lock
-
down drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the 
school year.
 
 
Park Avenue Elementary School provides
 
a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Students are 
supervised by teachers and administrators before and after school. During lunch and recess, yard duty personnel and 
administrators supervise students. Staff assists with supervisi
on after school. There is a designated student drop
-
off and 
pickup area at the main entrance of the school. All visitors must sign in at the office, where they receive a badge that must
 
be displayed at all times. Visitors are encouraged to give teachers pr
ior notification when visiting a classroom.
