School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description
 
 
Chavez Elementary is located in the city of Parlier in Fresno County. Parlier is a place rich with 
cultural heritage and has a 
special respect for its roots and celebrates its primary culture and language daily. Chavez Elementary is the only school in 
Parlier Unified that has a Bilingual Immersion Program. This alternative program is a Dual Immersion wh
ich is designed for 
English Leaners and Fluent English Proficient students. Instruction is provided in two languages in a balanced manner, and 
is designed to ensure that both groups learn to to read, write and speak English and Spanish.
 
 
Chavez Elementary 
serves students in pre
-
school through sixth grade.This also, includes two SDC classes. In order to 
achieve mastery of the adopted curriculum standards in reading writing, mathematics, social studies, science, and physical 
fitness, our school expectations a
re for students to achieve to their highest level with the assistance of staff and parents. 
In addition to the academics at our site, we have an After School Program. Some our extra
-
curricular activities include 
cultural celebrations,Sports activities, Mat
h Club and Music classes for grade 4th 
-
6th grade.
 
 
The staff is committed in providing a safe environment for our students. We maintain a safe environment for our students 
by having school policies and practices that ensures that we have adequate supervis
ion before, during and after school. 
We enforce the policies set by our Governing Board and all California Educational Codes to contribute to the best possible 
working and learning environment.
 
 
Chavez Elementary utilizes Positive Behavior Interventions an
d Supports (PBIS) and TIME to Teach. Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a process for creating school environments that are more predictable and effective 
for achieving academic and social goals. A key strategy of the PBIS process is pr
evention. In conjunction with TIME To 
Teach, our students are provided with Teach
-
To's at the beginning of the school year and reviewed throughout the school 
year to teach the school's expectations, and acknowledged for their positive behavior. through ins
truction , 
comprehension and regular practice, all stakeholders use a consistent set of behavior expectations and rules. When some 
students do not respond to teaching of the behavioral rules, we must re
-
teach. These practices are creating a school 
communit
y where all students, parents, and staff have a safe learning environment and ensuring student achievement.

With the implementation of the Common Core State Standards, our teachers will focus on teaching the necessary skills 
that students will need for Co
llege and Career Readiness. Mathematics and Reading comprehension and writing strategies, 
will be the emphasis. Teachers continue to provide our students with the skills to become proficient writers and the use 
of strategies that engage all students. 
 
 
Our
 
students in grades 3
-
6th have been utilizing their IPADs in the classroom to conduct research, learn keyboarding skills, 
and take notes from lectures and videos. All students in K
-
6 have access to IPADs to use for skills review through IXL and 
literacy sk
ills through AR.The use of technology will continue to be the focus through out the school day. It is our goal that 
all students are proficient in computer literacy skills and technology tools to enhance classroom instruction.
 
 
It is a fact that all studen
ts benefit when they come to school everyday and arrive on time. Daily attendance increases 
academic achievement. This also teaches students work habits that are necessary for their education and work careers. It 
is essential that students attend daily to 
ensure each child receives access to the educational program provided by our 
highly qualified staff. We work with students and parents and emphasizing the benefits of perfect attendance.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement and communication is essential for our student's academic growth and success. Parent training is 
offered through PBS Kids in which parents attend workshops in varied topics.Our monthly calendar informs parents of the 
instructional focus 
for each grade level and school activities. Our parents regularly receive phone notification of school 
activities.We have a marquee and website that is updated weekly.
 
Parents are invited to participate in our (PTO) Parent Teacher Organization which suppor
ts our school activities. Also, 
parents can attend and participate in School Site Council (SSC) meetings and the English Learner Advisory Committee 
(ELAC). These groups include parents and teachers which approve our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and 
make 
recommendations on students learning English.
 
Parents volunteer and help when we have enrichment activities such as the School carnival, Movie nights, Pastries with 
parents and Student Appreciation Day. Parents are invited to attend Award Assemblies, 
Parent conferences, Science Fair, 
Talent showcase and the Winter program.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is very important to the staff at Cesar Chavez. The plan is reviewed yearly at the beginning of school 
year.Students are supervised before, during recess and after school. All visitors must sign in and out at the front office 
when entering o
ur campus. All visitors must wear a visitors pass that must be visible while on campus. All volunteers are 
screened through our district parent volunteer policy.
 
All gated entrance remain locked during the school day and are unlocked only by school staff d
uring student drop off and 
dismissal. Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) with Time ToTeach provide the structures that allow for 
reporting discipline disruptions in out of the classroom. Discipline is handled fairly and consistent. Playgrou
nd safety rules 
are routinely reviewed. We regularly practice fire drills, lockdowns drills and Earthquake drills. The School Safety Plan is 
annually updated with staff input and then is approved by School Site Council. The plan was reviewed at the beginni
ng of 
school year during first staff meeting in August. New communication radios were purchased so that classified and 
Administration are in contact through out the school day.
