By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Vail Elementary is one of the district's original elementary schools, built in 1978. The school was named a California 
Distinguished School in 1995, 2002 and 2006. The school was named a California 
Title I Achievement School in 2013. In 
2019
-
20, the school's enrollment is currently 477.
 
 
Vail was closed for the 2018
-
2019 school year for renovation. It has reopened with the latest technology, furniture, and 
innovations all around campus. Our vision is
 
that all students will S.A.I.L.(Scientific and Innovative Learning) At Vail 
elementary. We strive to be on the cutting edge of pedagogy and technology to ensure the success of all of our students.
 
 
There are 21 regular education classrooms being utilized,
 
three special education classrooms, a media center, a computer 
lab, a multi
-
purpose room, one room used by Speech and Language Professionals, an Innovation lab, two maker space 
classrooms, and two literacy support classrooms.
 
 
At Vail Elementary, the educ
ation of each child is our number one priority. Through staff development, we support our 
teachers in their goal of having all students meet or exceed grade level standards. As a Title I school, Vail Elementary 
receives additional support to provide help f
or students struggling in the areas of reading, math and English language 
acquisition. Vail Elementary has set a course to continue to improve our academic program so that students show 
progress. Parents are considered to be an important part of the school
 
experience at Vail Elementary.
 
 
Parental support and enrichment help children view school as vital and relevant to their lives. Thus, we offer parental 
involvement programs such as the Parent Resource Room, Family Nights and evening Parent Trainings. The 
Parent 
Resource Room  exists to support parents and give them the tools to become stronger academic coaches to their children. 
Parents have the opportunity to be on the PTA, School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, and district LCAP 
committ
ee.
 
 
Vail's library is now one of the most innovative spaces in our school district. We have an Innovation Lab and two 
SmartBoards in our library that we call the Discovery Center. The library collection also includes a wide assortment of 
books 
reflecting the cultural diversity of our school and community. Books in Spanish are available at all levels to assist 
students during their transition from Spanish to English. Classes visit the library on a weekly basis and receive lessons on 
title, author
, genre, and subject matter. Every item in the library is bar coded and can be found through the online library 
catalog system. The library media center is available to students and their families before, during and after school to use 
reference materials 
and research topics on the Internet.
 
 
Wednesday Morning Flag Salute Assembly is a weekly event that brings students, staff and families together. The Assembly 
highlights student accomplishments, school pride, ASB, PTA, spirit days, school events, and The P
ositive Behavior 
Intervention System.  Vail's ASB sponsors school spirit days, and an annual talent show, as well as giving representatives 
in the upper grades opportunities to develop leadership skills.   Vail has adopted the computer based program, Schol
astic 
Reading Counts, to promote and raise achievement scores in reading comprehension in grades 1
-
5. Currently, there are 
6,000 Reading Counts quizzes available for student use. The program allows students to choose books of high interest at 
their appropr
iate reading level.  Based on updated student performance data, it is determined that Vail Elementary School 
continues to make great strides in the area of student achievement.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Vail was closed for the 2018
-
2019 school year for renovati
on. It has reopened with the latest technology, furniture, and 
innovations all around campus. Our vision is that all students will S.A.I.L.(Scientific and Innovative Learning) At Vail 
elementary. We strive to be on the cutting edge of pedagogy and technolo
gy to ensure the success of all of our students. 
Ongoing improvements still in process are our Bases (Child care) building and re
-
paving our blacktop.
 
 
TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe
 
for students, 
teachers and staff. Daily cleaning schedules guarantee that classrooms, offices and bathrooms are clean and well 
maintained. All of the District's elementary schools have one full time lead custodian who maintains the campus during 
school ho
urs. After school, a night crew cleans the entire facility. Between two and three times a year, the school's carpets 
are steam cleaned. In order to respond to work requests in a timely manner, TVUSD utilizes an electronic work order 
system. That way, when 
a site secretary, custodian or administrator has a request, they can put it into the system directly. 
This makes for a more time efficient processing of work orders. Vail Elementary School has a total of 50 classrooms (37 
permanent classrooms and 13 portab
les). In addition, the school has a multipurpose room, a library and an administration 
building. The main campus was built in 1978.

School Safety Plan (School Year

-

School safety is a high priority for our school and district.  Our School Site Safety Plan is a comprehensive plan that 
encompasses all disaster preparedness procedures and emergency plans. It also addresses everyday procedures and 
standards tha
t ensure the safety of students on campus. This plan is updated and approved annually by the School Site 
Council in December. After approval by the SSC, it is presented to staff at a regularly scheduled staff meeting.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is
 
fully enclosed by fencing.  School visitors and volunteers are required to sign in at 
the front office using the Raptor system prior to entering campus.
 
 
A copy of each School Site Safety Plan is also maintained by the Temecula Police Department. Officers
 
can access every 
TVUSD School Site Safety Plan via laptop computers in their cars. Our School Wide Safety plan was last reviewed and 
updated in 2019 and continues to remain current.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our 
school conducts emergency drills regularly 
throughout the school year. Education Code mandates that all elementary schools hold a fire drill each month they are in 
session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the school year.
