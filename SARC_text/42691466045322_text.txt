About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Re
port Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountab
ility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SAR
C.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the 
CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Ready Gen, by 
Pearson. In the 2015

16 school year, teachers across elementary sites piloted 
math programs, and enthusiastically recommended the Bridges math 
program, from the Math Learning Center. It is now being implemented with rave reviews in all classrooms. A new science progra

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Summerland School was built in 1965 and consists of four modular buildings. Beyond the 
regular playground facilities and play structures, the school also 
has a school garden. Adjoining the school property is an additional playground area, which includes a basketball court and a 
tennis court. During the 
summer of 2004, the front two portables
 
and the office area were completely modernized, in addition to upgrading the facility for Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) access and upgrading the student bathrooms and adding a staff restroom. Also on the campus is a fully 
functioning, small school
 

Each classroom reflects the 

Our school provides a safe, clean, and functional 
environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. The principal and custodial staff work
 
closely together to 
maintain the campus environment. We operate an online work o
rder system that maintenance crews prioritize and see to it that the school is safe, clean, 
and in good repair. Our school has a custodian available during school hours and evenings.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred 
Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating,
 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

nhance the curriculum 
both financially and with time to suppo


learning. The pare
nts lead 
a number of fundraisers during the year including a Jog
-
a
-
thon and each spring we hold an all
-
school play.  All proceeds are used to enhance the 
curriculum and purchase supplies not available through District and State funds.
 
 
Parent Group: The Su
mmerland School Parent Group (PFS) is an integral part of the school and the school's programs are enriched through their 

classroom
s by supporting 
the use of instructional assistants and other personnel.  Both the Parent Group and the School Site Council hold monthly meet
ings.
 
 
Parent Volunteers: Our parent volunteers help in our total school effort. They assist by helping in the clas
sroom, chaperoning field trips, and in many 
other ways. Parents are encouraged to volunteer. All volunteers must be fingerprinted at our District office and present a ce
rtificate that shows proof 
that they are free of tuberculosis.

how to become involved please contact Dr. Michelle Fox, mfox@cusd.net
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil 
suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety is a prime concern at Summerland School. The comprehensive School Safety Plan is evaluated and amended, if needed, by 
the staff and the
 
school 
community each year to ensure that the plan meets all the needs of the school. The School Safety Plan includes goals that not
 
only involve a major 
disaster, but also addresses ensuring a safe physical environment and developing healthy bodies, as w
ell as maintaining a secure and nurturing social 
environment. We conduct monthly emergency drills.
 
 
Each year parents create an emergency bag of food and other supplies.  Each classroom also contains a small emergency bin wit
h emergency supplies. 
Parents a
re asked to update the Student Emergency Card annually.  Students are only released to the people listed on the card.
 
 
In the event of a disaster, the school has medical supplies located in a common area, our teacher workroom.  We are fortunate
 
to have the
 
fire station 
located very close to the school. The complete School Safety Plan is located for review in the school office; it is reviewed 
and revised annually by the 
faculty. The last review occurred in September 2019.
