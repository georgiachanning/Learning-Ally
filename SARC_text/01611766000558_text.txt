School Description
 
Welcome to Brier Elementary School, proud home of the Broncos. This School Accountability 
Report card shares with the community our efforts to meet the district mission of ensuring all 
students are col
lege and career ready. Located in the heart of Fremont, Brier Elementary houses 
over 600 students from many different cultures. As of the 2019
-
20 school year, our school serves 
students in transitional kindergarten through fifth grade, as our sixth graders
 
moved to Walters 

emotionally, and academically to become lifelong learners and successful members of their 
community. Our students will leave prepared 
for the 21st century with the following habits for 

citizenship, take initiative, and emulate the Eight Great Traits! We exist as a community to ensure 
high 
levels of learning for all students in a safe and positive environment.  In 2016, Brier Elementary 
was proud to have received state recognition as the recipient of both the California Gold Ribbon 
Award and the California Title I Academic Achievement Award.
 
 
Our mission and vision are carried out through building a culture of professionals where the focus 
is centered on student learning. Our professional learning teams participate in collaborative 
meetings where teachers plan for the educational needs of 
ALL students  We are a school where 
staff, students, parents, and community members are valued and work together to maintain a 
culture where we hold ourselves accountable for the success of every child. Our highly trained and 
devoted teachers are competent
 
at setting rigorous academic goals for all students and are 
steadfast in working with them to achieve those goals. In preparing our students with 21st
-
century 
skills, we have invested in Chrome book carts and a flex/computer lab to expose each of our 
stud
ents to technology daily and strive to create responsible digital citizens. All devices house the 
latest research
-
based software in English language arts and mathematics.  Our library continually 
purchases new books to expose our students to a variety of g
enres that are aligned to the Common 
Core State Standards.
 
 
Brier is a high needs school that receives LCAP supplemental funding to provide targeted supports 
and resources to unduplicated students. These funds are used in a variety of ways to provide 
inter
vention and technology to assist our students in mastering the grade level standards and 
preparing them with 21st
-
century skills needed to be competitive in a global market. We offer 
before, during and after school interventions in the areas of math, Engli
sh language arts and 
computer skills. We are fortunate to partner with the city of Fremont to provide the Extended 
Learning Program for 90 third through fifth graders. This program is funded through the California 
Proposition 49 and offers enrichment, phys
ical activity, and homework support.

We continue to use our character education program entitled Project Heart, Head, Hands (H3) as well as the Scholarly Habits a
nd 
Restorative Practices. H3 helps students to develop 
positive character and decision
-
making skills. Our character education and service 
projects have focused on learning about children with leukemia and fundraising on their behalf and this year, assembling over
 
10,000 
food kits through Kids Against Hunger an
d providing funds for Make a Wish foundation through letter writing. Over the last five years, our 
students have written over 55,000 letters for the Make a Wish foundation, earning nearly $55,000 to make children's wishes co
me true. 
The Scholarly Habits he
lp students focus on the lifelong traits of persevering through challenges, striving for excellence, and being 
prepared. To complement these programs, our school is working on having a Growth Mindset where students and staff focus on th
e 
power of yet and h
aving the grit to persevere. For many years, Brier has received a grant from the Safe Routes to School. This grant focuses 
on the importance of taking care of our environment by opting to walk, roll or carpool to school. We sponsor Walk and Roll to
 
School 
Days,  Bike to School Day, the Golden Sneaker contest and the Bike Mobile. As enrichment, we offer Young Rembrandts, Math Oly
mpiad 
and Young Engineers to challenge students' minds.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have
 
enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of 
Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Brier Elementary campus opened in 1965 and rests on over seven acres. Our site consists of three large baseball fields fo
r community use, Glankler 

e daycare, and Brier Elementary School. Our site capacity is 772.  Brier has 26 regular 
education classrooms, one science lab, a flex room, resource room, library, multi
-
use room with basketball facilities, and an administration building. We 
have three pla
ygrounds along with basketball courts, ball walls, benches, peepholes, and front fencing. Our stage was remodeled in the spri
ng of 2008, 
and our blacktop was resurfaced in the summer of 2009. We have a large covered area for student dining.
 
 
The school has
 
undergone two major renovations, one in 1999 and again in 2005. Modernization included handicapped access, remodeled student 
restrooms, new furnaces, air conditioning, new roofing, paint, electrical upgrades, flooring, earthquake retrofitting, and a 
new s
tudent drop
-
off parking 
lot. Additional exterior lighting, garbage cans, kindergarten play equipment, and picnic tables and benches were installed wi
th approval through the 
School Site Council. New lunch shelters were erected in the spring of 2007. Kinderg
arten picnic tables were added in 2011 to accommodate kindergarten 
lunch. A drinking fountain was added to the multi
-
use room in the fall of 2012. In 2016, Cub Scout Pack 120 updated the landscaping in the 2nd grade 
courtyard area and an electronic marquee
 
was installed. The Rotary Club recently donated eight  flower pots that are disbursed around the campus.
 
 
Three full
-
time custodians keep our site clean. Fremont USD maintenance staff works very hard to ensure that repairs necessary to keep t
he school in 
working order are completed in a timely manner. District maintenance staff uses a work order priority process to ensure effic
ient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority. We are currently concluding a huge technology upgrade which
 
will provide greater broadband and 
faster internet and more efficient phone service.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection
 

e on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since tha
t time, those conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the 
Smarter Bal
anced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students 
who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided 
by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety is the number one priority of Brier staff.  School grounds are monitored before and after school 
as well as at all recesses. We have five noon 
supervisors who, along with administration monitor students during the lunch period. The staff regularly reviews the expectat
ions for safety and 
responsible behavior in class as well as on the playgrounds. Our 
H3 character education program and Scholarly Habits play a large role in this area. Our 
yard is fenced from the back, however, due to its large size, security is a must. All visitors must enter through the school 
office, sign in, and display a 
color
-
coded 
visitor badge before going to any area on site. We change our color badges daily to prevent badges from being reused. Adheren
ce to our 
visitor policy is strictly enforced as our student and staff safety is of the utmost importance.
 
 

chool Safety Plan addresses protocols and procedures for a variety of potential disasters. The plan is updated yearly, most 
recently updated in March 2019.  The plan addresses the placement of staging areas, specific job descriptions for staff, pare
nt chec
kout procedures, 
emergency lists, first aid, our zero
-
tolerance policy, security, and radio contact. The plan includes procedures for all emergencies and disasters, our 
discipline policy, and Board policies. It also includes other safety procedures pertain
ing to character education, gang violence, student success, and 
vandalism. The safety plan is revised and reviewed annually each fall by the staff. Our Safety Committee meets regularly ever
y other month and is 
primarily responsible for the written piece of
 
the plan and creating school
-
wide safety goals. Once the plan is approved, the entire staff receives revised 
electronic copies. General safety procedures are shared with the entire student body at the beginning of the year and reviewe
d throughout the year
 
in 
various ways. Safety information is relayed to parents through our Brier Bulletin and emergency information sent home in our 
first
-
day packets. The plan 
is available in the office for parents to review and is posted online. We practice disaster and loc
kdown (stranger danger) drills throughout the year and 
conduct monthly fire drills. Nearly all classroom teachers have been trained in CPR and first aid. In October we conducted an
 
in
-
depth disaster drill which 
included parent release. In October of 2018, 
we held a Safety Day which included presentations and activities from Fremont police and fire department, 
earthquake preparedness and Safe Routes to School safety rodeo. This year our staff is invited to attend a Basic Trauma Care 
training in early Decmebe

Professional Development 
provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and profes
sional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
