School Description
 
Hillview Middle School is the sole middle school in Menlo Park City School District, serving over 950 
students in grades 6 
-
 
8. A 1:1 iPad school with a focus on design thinking, competency
-
 
and 
mastery
-
based grading, social emotional learning, and asset d
evelopment, we focus on the whole 
child in fulfilling our mission, "The Hillview Community inspires and empowers all students to be 
curious and resilient problem solvers, compassionate and constructive contributors, and lifelong 
learners during their indiv
idual and collective journey of academic and personal growth." In 
addition. Hillview has identified five "core skills" that we seek to develop in our students over the 
course of their middle school years: curiosity, compassion, critical thinking, ownership
, and 
resilience. Our school goals reflect the Menlo Park City School District Local Control and 
Accountability Plan. As such, we look to improve the academic outcomes of all students, especially 
those who are underrepresented in the UC and Cal State syste
ms. In addition, student wellness and 
parent engagement are of paramount importance. Finally, we are engaged in efforts to personalize 
learning, using both technological platforms and project
-
based learning as lenses for this work. Our 
Site Council monitor
s progress of our school goals, and faculty participate in Collaboration Around 
Student Outcome days to review student evidence of learning and respond with adjustments to 
curriculum, interventions, and progress monitoring. We are proud to offer such progr
ams as over 
20 lunchtime clubs, strong visual and performing arts electives, a vibrant Associated Student Body, 
a focus on service, restorative practices that co opt students into repairing harm to the community, 
and collaborative structures that allow our
 
teachers to meet weekly to discuss students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2006, the community approved a $91.1 million bond measure to improve district facilities. As part of the Bond program, the
 
School District decided to 
replace the existing facility wi
th new facilities on the existing field and convert the current building area to a new field. The new state
-
of
-
the
-
art campus 
was completed and opened in September 2012 with the field being completed in March 2013. The new school includes 48 teaching 
space
s including a 
gym building, performing arts building with music classrooms, specialized science classrooms, library, administration, and su
pport space. The school 
includes a large new synthetic field with a running track and blacktop area for basketball an
d other physical activities. The gym facility was built in 2002 
and was integrated into the new school. The District has made improvements to the HVAC, and interior finish during the summer
s of 2013
-
2015. The 
District takes great efforts to ensure that all
 
schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Director of Maintenance and Operations 
and the site Principal conduct an annual walk
-
through to identify and prioritize necessary maintenance projects. The District maintenance staff k
eeps 
the school in good repair and working order by completing necessary tasks in a timely manner. A work order process is used to
 
ensure efficient service 
and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. Cleaning standards for all schools in the
 
district have been established. The principal and 
Director of Maintenance and Operations work closely with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. The District 
annually sets monies aside for long
-
term maintenan
ce projects. The district's complete maintenance plan is available at the district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

and field trips, and assist in the school library. The Hillview Site Council, which includes six parent representatives, is r
esponsible for developing and 
oversee
ing the School Plan for Student Achievement
 
 
We engage all parents, including our College Bound parents, with community and education events, and we are attuned to our pa
rent voices as they give 
us annual feedback on our Panorama Family School and Teacher 
surveys. Our annual parent

-
student conferences involve parents meaningfully 
in their students' education and growth. Hillview receives additional program support from local universities, the Menlo Park
 
Police, Fire, and Recreation 
Departments, and 
other local organizations. Special mentor relationships between Hillview students and community members are arranged by our 
counselors and after
-
school programs.

Hillview utilizes its three Staff Collaboratively Developed Professional Development Days and its three Collaboration Around 
Student Outcomes days to 
engage its teachers in meaningful activities that support and enrich our students. Our professional development choices help 
us meet our site goals, 
which align to MPCSD strategic directions. We organize and run our own professional development days using 
site and district staff, we bring in coaches 
and trainers to support our efforts, and we send our teachers to the conferences that enrich their practice.
 
 
Our ELA, Social Studies, and Science teachers are all engaged to various degrees in the selection and
 
implementation of adopted materials, and this 
process does require time for thoughtful deliberation and piloting.
 
 
Teachers attend conferences and home
-
grown institutes on our current focuses, including personalization, mastery and competency
-
based gradin
g, 
equity, learner variability, project
-
based learning, restorative practices, and discipline
-
specific conferences such as NSTA, NCTM, and CABE. We strongly 
believe that teachers need to seek out and attend those training that will further their growth.
 
 
D
uring implementation, teachers are supported by PLC's and adminsitrators during our existing collaborative structures (weekly
 
Weds. and Thurs. 
afternoon meetings, common prep periods) and during planned release days.

Types of Services Funded
 
Hillview provides a myriad of programs and services to meet the needs of all students. In the 2018
-
29 school year, numerous specialists, including special 
education teachers and an English Learner specialist, supported students as collaborative partners in
 
mainstream classes, as well as provided direct 
instruction for students who required remediation or additional support. Instructional aides and paraprofessionals also push 
in to classrooms to assist 
student growth. Hillview is a fully inclusive school tha
t features the Advancing Independent Minds (AIMs) program for students who require additional 
support in a comprehensive middle school setting. Additional services at Hillview include speech and language specialists, re
source specialists, 
psychologists, sc
hool counselors, mental health services, and nursing.
 
 
Core textbooks are purchased with district funds and state funds, and monies raised by the PTO supplement instructional mater
ials and supplies. We are 
constantly working to increase the amount and qual
ity of technology in our schools. Finally, lunch time and after
-
school support programs funded by 
both the district and the PTO give students access to mentoring, teacher, and staff support.
