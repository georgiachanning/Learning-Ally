School Description
 
Camellia Basic Elementary School is an academic prep school that develops excellence through 
emphasis on a 
strong foundation in mastering academic standards and good behavior. The Camellia 
Basic School community, staff, parents and students work as a team to build excellence in both 
academics and citizenship. Camellia offers two programs to meet the needs of ou
r families:  Basic 
and GATE Cluster.  A major emphasis of the Basic School Program in grades 1
-
6 is the development 
of academic skills and good study habits.  Students must meet admission criteria to be accepted to 
the lottery for the Basic Program.  The o
verall goal of the school staff is to bring together the most 
successful traditional and new methods of instruction which emphasize academic skills and good 

  
A collaborative relationship between parents and teachers creates ideal conditions for student 
learning and high levels of achievement.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) supports excellence through a program that specifically 
addresses the needs of g
ifted children.  The program at Camellia combines GATE instructional 
strategies and curriculum with our Basic program.  This instructional model provides basic skills 
instruction, enrichment, acceleration and in
-
depth learning experiences for the more acad
emically 
able student. The goal of our staff is to provide engaging instruction with rigor and relevance to 
make our students prepared academically and socially for the challenges of tomorrow.  Students 
develop lifelong skills by participating in art, musi

school
-
wide class meeting  model helps students become outstanding citizens learning ethics, 
problem solving strategies, communication skills, and conflict resolution.
 
 
The staff at Camellia Basic 
believes that cooperation between the home and school is essential to 
the success of students in our programs. To promote understanding and commitment to the goals 
of the program, a 3
-
way contract between the parent, student and teacher is implemented in 
g
rades 1st through 6th. The contract outlines important expectations for students, parents and 
staff.
 
When enrolling students in our Basic or GATE program, parents are encouraged to volunteer 40 
hours of their time towards their student's education. Parents
 
may help in many ways such as 

copies weekly for the teachers, and assisting in the office as needed.
 
 
Camellia Basic has a tradition of excellence.

In 2003 and 2004, U. S. Secretary of Education Ron Payne recognized Camellia Basic as a National Achieving School. Only t
wo schools in 
the state were recognized with this honor.  This award recognizes the highest performing Title I schools in the state of Cali

bon School. In 2010 Camellia 
was one of only 21 schools in California to receive the honor.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-

the district's adopted courses of study and meet 
current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the
 
adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidere

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and 
career, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators and teachers.

To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Liter
acy (including ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afford
ed through this program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessment for learni
ng, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides 
the opportunity for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a sh
ared sense of responsibility.
