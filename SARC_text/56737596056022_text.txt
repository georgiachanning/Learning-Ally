By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language
 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Text
books in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, sci
ence, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supplementary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a commi
ttee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analyzing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committee
s comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achieve high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/lan
guage 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Education and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes 
the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided e
ach pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Each fall, all schools in the Conejo Valley Unified School District are inspected by a team which 
consists of all or many of 
the following personnel:   Site Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New 
Construction, and the Assistant Superintendent. A facilities evaluation is completed documenting the condition of
 
the 
school in a variety of area  including the cleanliness of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems, 
landscape maintenance, etc.   Any condition observed that represents a threat to the health and safety of students and 
staff, i
s annotated for immediate correction.  Items noted which could improve the utility, appearance, or safety of the

the funds available to address those needs.  The final list is approved by the Board of Education in the Spring, with the

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

We have an extremely active and highly supportive Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Our PTA Executive Board meets 
monthly, we have at minimum of two annual General Association membership meetings an
d numerous sub

committee 
activities/meetings throughout the school year. Together with our Eagle Flyer newsletter, our PTA provides weekly 
information to our families. This creates excellent school to home communication for all.  In addition, our school to
 
home 
correspondence is translated into Spanish for our English Learner families. Our amazing PTA funds many important 
programs and supports for our students, including: academic intervention, community outreach, technology/computer 
software programs, musi

All parents have the opportunity to participate on our School Site Council (SSC) where they can be involved in making 
decisions and recommendations that directly impact the education of their children.
 
 
Parents of Eng

making process.
 
 
We have parent reps serving on District Advisory Committees: SEDAC (Special Education)  DELAC (English Learner)  
GATEDAC (Gifted and Talented) and DAC (District Adv
