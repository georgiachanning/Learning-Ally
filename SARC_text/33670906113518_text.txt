By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's Message
-
 

-
wide mission is to create a positive learning environment that 
prepares students for a future of lifelong 
learning and helps produce ethical, responsible, and productive citizens.
 
 
Peralta is an AVID Elementary.  At Peralta, we strive to instill in our students a belief in themselves and in their futures.
  
Becoming pa
rt of the AVID Network of Schools correlates wonderfully with our goals.  We demonstrate our Culture of 

to creating a compassionate, col
laborative school community that knows no limits to the academic success of each 
student.  Our AVID goal:  All Peralta students will make yearly progress toward meeting or exceeding state standards in 
reading, writing, and mathematics. In doing so, these a
cademic foundations will lead them toward college and career 
readiness.
 
 
Peralta Elementary School opened in 1996.  It is a lovely campus featuring a unique architectural design with classrooms 
and playgrounds located on multiple levels.  We provide high
-
q
uality instruction to support our diverse students.
 
 
At Peralta, we strive to provide all students with a wide variety of academic experiences. It is our goal to meet all of thei
r 
needs, whether through additional support because they are performing below 
grade level or enrichment activities 
because they are advanced. As a result, we have developed a number of programs to support our students. We created 
an Intervention Program for our students demonstrating literacy deficiencies in primary and upper grades
. Students 
receive extra support with fluency, phonemic awareness, letter recognition, letter sounds, and guided reading to develop 
literacy skills. We have also established a pull
-
out and push
-
in program for our GATE students. These sessions provide 
multi
ple opportunities for our Gifted and Talented children to explore various academic areas of study such as music and 
art history as well as government, architecture and more.
 
 
Peralta has a collaborative and consultation service model for students on Indivi
dual Education Plans receiving Resource 
Specialist services. A nurse is present approximately one day per week and a school psychologist is present approximately 
three days per week.  Counseling services are available through the district and with referral
.  A health clerk serves 
students for three hours each day and a Language, Speech and Hearing specialist is on site daily.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee o
f a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the conte
nt standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most 
recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/langua
ge arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the
 
first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks che
cked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of our school are a high priority to the district. Overall, school grounds and faciliti
es 
are in good repair. Our custodial staff consists of one daytime and one evening custodian who perform basic cleaning 
operations 
throughout the campus. The Districts Deferred Maintenance Plan is assessed and updated every year. Work 
generated by the Deferred Maintenance Plan is generally completed during the summer months. Fire inspections are 
conducted on an annual basis and any is
sues are addressed immediately. The District also has an internal inspection team 
conducting annual safety inspections of all sites. All safety related items are handled as a top priority.

Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

communication with parents. We make sure our teachers a
re available and provide various opportunities for informal and 
formal parent conferences. In addition, parents are always notified about and invited to school events through a variety 
of resources such as agendas, the district TeleParent phone

teamwork, which encompasses all aspects of home and school. We believe parents and staff working together provides 
our students the best educational opportunities possible. Peralta staff members are striving toward

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Peralta staff places a focus on safety, health, and the well
-
being of our students. Three areas to ensure our school is a safe 
and secure learning 

annually and is kept on file at the district office and in the school office. Every staff member is part of the development 
and implementation of the emergen
cy plan (SEMS positions and responsibilities). The districtwide Safety Task Force 
inspects campuses and works with staff to ensure a safe facility and the district Safe Schools Committee sets direction and 
provides resources for violence, drug, alcohol, an
d tobacco prevention.
 
 
In accordance with Senate Bill 187, Peralta Elementary School employs safe school strategies that include information on 
the status of school crime and the following elements: safe school programs; child
-
abuse reporting procedures; d
isaster
-
response procedures; suspension and expulsion policies pursuant to Education Code Sections 48900, 48915, and 49709; 

safety on the w
ay to and from school, as well as during school hours. The plan is updated annually and was most recently 
approved by the School Site Council in March 2019.
 
 
The PTA makes a monetary donation to update and build upon our emergency supplies. We have been co
mpiling 
emergency water and food supplies, blankets, first
-
aid supplies, radios, flashlights, and tools recommended for use in a 
disaster. Peralta has emergency backpacks in each classroom that contain basic first
-
aid supplies, as well as the necessary 
equ
ipment and documentation for an evacuation. Our students are trained on how to evacuate quickly and safely.
