School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

success for every student. We have a very caring and positive environment, and visitors always comment o

excellent behavior. We have sing
-
alongs and student recognition assemblies once a month, academic competitions, ample 
play yards, and a strong art and science program to compliment our Literacy and Math instruction and curriculum. We 
have i
ntervention and enrichment programs, providing students with opportunities to make valuable gains in their 
learning. Students are leveled for literacy intervention and ELD between grade levels and math at the 4th and 5th grades.  
We reduce class sizes for 
students performing below proficiency by including our resource and special program teachers 
during this intervention time. We also enrich proficient students with advanced learning opportunities.
 
Newly developed mission, vision and values:
 
Mission:
 
To ins
pire our community of learners to achieve their optimum potential.
 
 
Vision:
 
Every child, every classroom, every day.
 
Sassarini is a proud learning community where diversity is welcomed and celebrated.
 
 
Values:
 
 
All students and staff have the right to a 
safe and respectful learning environment that cultivates positive connections

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our 
school safety plan is updated annually and approved formally by the School Site Council, most recently in November 
2018. Students practice fire drills monthly and earthquake and lockdown drills are practiced twice a year, as required by 
law.
 
Staff monitors
 
the school grounds before and after school as well as at all recesses and at lunch time. Visitors must enter 
the school through the main door and sign in at the office.
