School Description
 
This school year, Kellogg leadership has worked diligently to develop a shared Purpose and Core 
Values amongst all stakeholders.  Our Purpose answers the question: Why do we exist as an 
organization?  Our Core Values answer the question: How does each memb
er of our organization 
behave?  These statements and beliefs were developed in collaboration with all stakeholders from 
community members, parents, classified staff, certificated staff, and administration.  The 
statements are shared, concise, and every mem
ber of our organization holds the responsibility not 
only to demonstrate on a daily basis but to hold each other accountable as well.
 
 
Purpose:
 
Kellogg exists as the heart of the community to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment, 
which 
maximizes student achievement through targeted instruction while nurturing relationships 
and creating responsible global citizens.
 
 
VISION:
 
We envision Kellogg as a place where high academic achievement, creativity and imagination take 
center stage through
 
strong parent engagement and teacher leadership.  Knowing  that children 
learn in many different ways, Kellogg will be a unique school where differentiation exists for the 
diverse learning styles, talents, interests, and abilities that our students posses
s.  Our students will 
achieve success both academically and socially through an integrated arts program, a love of 
reading both fiction and nonfiction, and a belief that every child can succeed.
 
 
Core Values:
 
1.
 
Students' needs come first.
 
 
2.
 
We cultivate posit
ive relationships school wide.
 
 
3.
 
We have a commitment to an "I Can" attitude.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
