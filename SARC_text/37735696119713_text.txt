School Description
 
 
NICHOLS VISION:
 
Nichols Elementary School is known for its challenging and rich standards

emphasizes the acquisition of basic skills along with problem solving, critical thinking, and creative 
experiences. Our goal is that all Nichols students will b
ecome motivated, engaged, life
-
long learners 
with diverse talents and interests, always striving to be their personal best. Through the instruction 
of creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking, Nichols students will be ready to 
face t

compassion to others through acts of kindness at school and in the community. Our students will 
learn teamwork, responsibility, and collaboration through partner
ships with peers, staff and 
parents. Nichols prides itself in a spirit of optimism, enthusiasm, and determination. Nichols 
Navigators will be Leaders of the Future!
 
 
NICHOLS MISSION STATEMENT:
 
Nichols Navigators are motivated, optimistic, creative problem 
solvers, and life
-

demonstrate leadership, responsibility and synergize through partnerships. Navigators always 
strive to be their personal best 
-

Nichols Elementary School school vision and mission st
atement emphasizes the growth mindset 
and leadership as focuses for our students. We are in the fourth year of implementation of the 
Leader in Me Program and after the first year of implementation we received a grant from Panda 
Cares to support our impleme
ntation. This year is our third year of the grant and through staff 
development and coaching staff is implementing the program into daily instruction. The Leader in 
Me provides students the opportunity to grow socially, emotionally as well as academically.
The 
program is firmly in place, staff is well trained and systems are in place to ensure the program 
continues to be successfully implemented even when the grant expires after this year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Bala
nced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible student
s 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Our School Site Council, which includes parent members, helps to create our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and the accompanying budgets. They 
monitor the programs at our school throughout the
 
year to determine effectiveness and to make recommendations on changes to the 
School Plan
. The 
English Language Advisory Committee is another parent governing board which oversees the site plan and funding for our studen
ts who are English 
language learner
s. Our PTO raises funds for extracurricular activities and helps to organize volunteers for classrooms, field trips, and scho
ol events. New 
members are always welcome and encouraged to participate as volunteers. We have strong parent and community support 
for our school. You can 
contact our PTO via email at info@nicholspto.org. The contact person for parent involvement is our principal.
 
In addition to these governing bodies, we provide many opportunities for parent involvement. For this school year, those i
nclude: Back to School Night, 
Flag Salute Assemblies, classroom and office volunteering, Awards Assemblies, Spring Carnival, Fun Run, Field Day, Family Sci
ence Night, Leader in Me 
events and Open House. Specific dates are on our website.

School Safety Plan
 
Our school has safe and modern playground equipment, w
hich district maintenance staff and our own custodial staff inspect regularly. Staff members 
supervise the playgrounds during all recess periods, and students are taught our playground safety guidelines. Nichols is a c
losed campus; all school 
visitors are 
required to check in at the office, leave an ID, and identify themselves with a school badge. Visitors must then check out th
rough the office 
to leave the campus.
 
 
Our emergency committee oversees monthly safety drills and the annual updating of our Crisis Response Plan. Students and staf
f practice for lock down 
situations, some in conjunction with the Oceanside Police Department, in addition to fire and earthquake d
rills. Additionally, our Safe Schools Plan is 
revised in the spring and must be approved by our district Board of Education. Our clean, safe campus reflects our pride in o
urselves and our community.

Teachers take time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. Teach
er training over the past 
three years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professi
onal development, technology in the 
classrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment pr
ogram. Teachers have 
received multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessmen
t program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional 
development activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collabora
tively plan and better 
understand the new curriculum an
d assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines. 
We are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1
-
2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on sit
e training and 
collaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In M
e program website and 
through school created websites. Teacher also receive teacher guides and books to support thei
r learning of the Leader In Me program. These professional 
development opportunities will all be held at Nichols Elementary.
