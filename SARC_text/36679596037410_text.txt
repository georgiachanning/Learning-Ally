By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
Dunlap Elementary School is a learning commu
nity dedicated to providing multiple opportunities for children to be 
successful in a positive, caring, and academic environment. As a Blended Learning site, Dunlap offers students lessons 
which are tailored to their specific learning levels.  By supplemen
ting with an online supplemental curriculum, staff 
provides individualized learning programs to students in kindergarten through fifth grades.  Through this program, 
students work at personal learning goals.  At Dunlap Elementary, students also participate
 
in various enrichment activities 
to develop a well
-
rounded educational experience.  During the course of the week, students engage in Physical Education 
and Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) classes on top of their core curricu
lum.  Outside of 
the regular school day, students have access to various extra
-
curricular activities such as gardening, art, robotics and 
foreign language classes. For those students who demonstrate the need for academic support, Dunlap offers an 
intervent
ion program through a multi
-
tiered system of support.  Those students who show the need participate in a 
reading intervention program taught by a reading intervention teacher.  Each intervention program is monitored by a 
team of stakeholders (including par
ents) called a Student Intervention Team.  The team monitors individual's data to 
ensure academic growth.
 
 
Family engagement is of focus at Dunlap.  With the support of parents on School Site Council, Parent Teacher Association 
and English Learner Advisory
 
Committee, students and staff are provided with opportunities to enjoy collaboration with 
our families.  With events such as assemblies, family learning nights and various parent meetings, we engage with our 
families outside of the regular school day.
 
 
To
 
promote a community of good citizenship throughout our campus, we employ the Positive Behavioral and Interventions 
and  Supports.  Our staff and students focus on our "5 Bes"
-
 
Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Safe, Be Here and Be 
Prepared.  This system p
romotes positive behaviors as a means to correct inappropriate choices.  Dunlap is a proud Silver 
Status PBIS School
 
 
We use  
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement is designed to raise the academic performance of students, improve the 
school's educational p
rogram, prepare students for 21st century learning and account for the expenditures of site 
categorical funding. A successful educational program means all students are mastering content standards and that 
academic performance targets are being met. Achiev
ement of these goals is dependent upon a school culture where 
school site goals are aligned with local, state, and federal student performance goals. There is a commitment to focus on 
the academic success of each child. Dunlap is a school where funds are t
argeted for expenditures that will increase student 
achievement.  Professional development and collaboration are valued components of these targeted funds. Teachers and 
administration meet to analyze and discuss student assessment data, best practices, ins
tructional focus and intervention. 
Our instructional staff uses a district
-
adopted curriculum by applying research
-
based instructional practices to 
thoughtfully prepare students for standards based assessments.

materials in Mathematics are not on the State Board of Education list, the materials were recommended by an adoption 
committee of staff and community members following extensive research on the alignment of the
 
materials to California

serve. The district has not yet adopted instructional materials in History

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items

stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Dunlap 
Elementary School is a closed campus. During school hours the entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in with 
the front office. All visitors are required to check in and to wear a visitor badge during their stay. While we welcome visit
s 
by parents and
 
community members, anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours should notify staff ahead of 
time. Yard duty aides, the principal, and teachers supervise students and monitor the campus during lunch, breaks, and 
before and after school.
 
 
The Compreh
ensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The 
plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the 
following requirements of SB 1
87 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of 
a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees to and from school; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures. 
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is revised annually before the beginn
ing of the school year. The plan is updated to 
include new staff, update comprehensive fire and earthquake drill details, lock down drills and other disaster plan details. 
The plan is a document that can be altered as needed through feedback from monthly s
afety walks with our custodian. 
Staff is also available to provide input during our bi
-
monthly staff meetings and through a custodial binder for safety 
requests. The components of the plan include: 
 

 
Assessment of School Crime
 

 
Child Abuse Reporting 
Procedures
 

 
Emergency Preparedness and Crisis Response Plan
 

 
Policies Relating to Suspension/Expulsion
