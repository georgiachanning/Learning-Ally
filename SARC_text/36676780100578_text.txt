About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have bee
n provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, tha
t are 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in the foll
owing subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instruct
ional materials were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes off
ered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for
 
each student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
yea
r. Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing ar
ts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California Stat
e Board of Education approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to
 
consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importa
nce to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact safely. At the 
e
nd of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a reg
ular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out durin
g breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. Planned or recently co
mpleted school improvements 
for this site were additional portable classrooms
 
added in the 2017/2018 school year, schoolwide keyless access system completed in the 2018/2019 
school year, and schoolwide security camera system planned in the 2020/2021 school year.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Opera
tions department staff conduct inspections at the school sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, 
and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the
 
Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPS
C), to record inspection results. 

 
any associated repairs were 
completed on or before December 30, 2019.

School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the S
chool Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are revi
ewed monthly by the School Site Council.  Each 

onents and procedures. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular b
asis so that all students and staff are familiar with emergency procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy reg
arding campus visitors is enforced by requiring 

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visit
ors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all gates remain locked during the 
school day, so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environ
ment that fosters health and safety, in both form and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan as a
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from 
the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect all students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency mana
gement, and pu
blic health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
ritical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School
 
personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. T
he Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimum requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management Syst
em (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Re
gulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
