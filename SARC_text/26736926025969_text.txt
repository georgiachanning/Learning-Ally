Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Mammoth Elementary School. The school is in compliance with all 

preparednes
s plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  Emergency drills are conducted 

leaving. During lunc
h, recesses, and before and after school, assigned staff members and paraprofessionals supervise 
students and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The 
school has an active Positive Behavior Inte
rvention and Support (PBIS) program in place.
 
 
In 1998, the first Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the district in consultation with local law enforcement in 
order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan is updated annually and provides 
students and staff a means to 
ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse 
reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures
 
for 
safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and dress code guidelines. The plan had its last 
comprehensive update and was reviewed with school staff in September, 2018. Another comprehensive update of the 
plan will occur in early 
2019.  A copy of the plan is available to the public at the school and district offices, as well on the 
MUSD website.
