Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

The overall mission at Farr Avenue School is to provide high quality instruction to each and every student.  
We understand that students come to our school with a variety of needs.  With that in mind, we continue to 
embrace research that states that high achieving schools succeed with all students when active participation and 

involvement from family and community exists.
At Farr Avenue School we believe there are no excuses for students not to make growth academically. We 
know it is the school™s responsibility to make sure students are learning. When students leave Farr, they will 

have the skills necessary to go to college. They will also know that academic success is everyone™s responsibility 

because ﬁIt begins with meﬂ.We provide an enormous amount of time and energy in educating our parents on the importance of their 
involvement in their students™ schooling.  We also make them feel comfortable and welcomed at our school.   

We work with community agencies and organizations to provide our students with skills necessary to succeed.
Farr Avenue School staff is taking teaching and learning above and beyond the basics and implementing 21st 
Century super skills, known as the 4Cs, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication. Through 

the use of collaboration, capacity building, and comprehension, our staff has started the process of developing 

strong and comprehensive staff development that supports the school vision and district focus.  Teachers and 

parents continuously receive the most updated information and quality in-services in order to meet the needs 

of all students.   
At Farr Avenue School, qualified teachers are committed to quality instruction; led by quality coaches and 
strong district support and leadership.

(School Year 2019Œ20)
Farr Avenue School™s Parent Teacher Association brings parents, teachers, students and community mem

all members of the school wide community.
Parent representation at District committee level meetings occurs in DAC and DELAC as scheduled.  
School Site Council is comprised of staff and parents that make up a governance body that oversees the 
School-Based Coordinated Programs and approval of budgets for these programs. The council meets at least 
four times a year.
Workshops, trainings, and special classes are made available and designed to meet the needs of the school/
parent community as defined through a survey conducted in the beginning of the school year. Nutrition and 

ESL classes are examples of educational opportunities Farr Avenue School offers.
Volunteer opportunities are abundant and varied at Farr whether it be in the classroom or around the 
school. Daily one can see parents preparing materials, supporting students in reading in the classroom, work
-ing in the library and in the nutrition area, and planning activities on a given committee. Our volunteers 
are invaluable to Farr.
