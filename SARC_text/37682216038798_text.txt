Lincoln Acres Vision and Mission Statement
 
 

 
 
Message from Principal, R
aymond Ruiz
 
 
Lincoln Acres School is a kindergarten through sixth grade elementary school located in an 
unincorporated area of National City. Our student population is rich in cultural diversity. We have 
a preschool, located adjacent to the school. We have
 
5 special education classes and 25 general 
education classes.
 
 
Lincoln Acres has a highly qualified staff of teachers, aides, and support personnel who are 
committed to creating the best possible educational experience for our children. Effective teaching
 
practices, the use of technology and instruction that implements the new Common Core State 
Standards, all support an educational environment where every child will learn and thrive. Our 
efforts have been focused on increasing student achievement at all gr
ade levels and for every 
student. At Lincoln Acres, we believe that the collaboration between teachers, support staff, 
administration, and parents, facilitates student achievement.

Our focus on the Common Core State Standards and the effective implementation of state 
adopted curriculum allows us to provide 
educational opportunities that meet the needs of every student at Lincoln Acres. With the continued effort of the whole schoo
l 
community, which includes the support of parents and community members, we will continue 
to provide a safe, nurturing environment 
that supports student learning. During the summer of 2014 approximately half of our teachers participated in a week
-
long STEMposium 
training through the San Diego County Office of Education. The training required th
at teachers completed four additional days during the 
school year so that learning was maintained, supported and implemented. In 2017 and 2018, four teachers were selected to part
icipate 
in the STEM training at the University of Notre Dame. In 2019, this t
eam attended a three
-
day workshop at Stanford University. The impact 
of this training will trickle through our entire staff through the train
-
the
-
trainer model of professional development for all teachers. During 
this training staff received training on in
corporating the STEAM+ subjects into the curriculum. These STEAM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts & Math ) subjects integrated with English Language Arts has increased student engagement and motivation in 
the 
classroom. Our staff has self
-
identified
 
as a STEAM+ school and a core of teachers have presented workshops at STEAM+ conferences 
throughout Southern California. Students have had increased opportunities to explore life, physical and earth sciences. The e
xcitement 
from the students has been evid
enced throughout the day, but most especially in student projects.
 
 
This dedicated staff has provided many extra opportunities above and beyond the regular school day to provide additional supp
ort to our 
children. Our school in partnership with the YMCA pr
ovides extended learning opportunities before and after school. The YMCA provides 
supervised academic enrichment, homework help, nutritious snack time, and sports on our campus from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on schoo
l days. 
 
 
Lincoln Acres has a very active Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA). English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and School Site Council 
(SSC). We are thankful to have such a wonderful group of dedicated parents to help us support our educational program. We are
 
always 
seeking parents and communit
y members to volunteer at Lincoln Acres School. 
 
 
Vision
 
 
Our vision is to provide our students with a superior education by incorporating the intersections of Literacy and STEAM subj
ects where 
students, families, and teachers are active learners 
through relevant, rigorous, and engaging hands
-
on
-
experiences, that lead to 
innovation and connect to the real world to ensure our students become compassionate professionals prepared for 
 
 
21st Century careers.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the cond
ition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et ann
ual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the Cal
ifornia Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair, and working order are comple
ted in a timely manner. A 
work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service, and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
We have made a conscientious effort to provide a clean and attractive campus. Students are encouraged to have pride in 
their school and keep the 
campus clean. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these
 
standards is available at 
the school office or at the district maintenance office. The principal and ass
istant principal work daily with the custodial staff and the custodial supervisor 
to develop cleaning schedules in ensuring a clean and safe school.
 
 
New School Projects
 
The new school construction project funded by local bond funds (Measure N) was complet
ed during summer of the 2015
-
16 school year. The projects 
included the following: adding air conditioners to every classroom and multi
-
purpose room, upgrading electrical capacity for four school sites. a complete 
upgrade of our network cabling, upgrading n
etwork infrastructure hardware at all sites including the district office, a complete replacement of the district 
fiber optic cabling network, and a complete reconfiguration of the network to accommodate higher network speeds and greater n
etwork bandwidth.
 
 
The Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT)
 
The FIT is used on a yearly basis to identify facility needs and repairs.  All items found in need of repair on the FIT are a
ddressed.  Items that involve 
asphalt, roofing, flooring or painting are addressed through t
he District's deferred maintenance program.  All other items are expedited into the National 
School District work order system and repaired by our maintenance department.

) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful analysis of achievement data. The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teach
ers also have opportunities to attend conferences 
and district wide professional development throughout the year. Areas of focus for teacher training include effective instruc
tional strategies for 
implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for
 
Data Teams collaboration, curriculum training in writing, language arts (ARC and 
Benchmark) and mathematics (UCI Math Project), as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners.  The pr
oject includes hands
-
on, 
research
-
based professio
nal development, standards
-
based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the 
implementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content exp
erts, an
d math 
education researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to
 
the needs highlighted 
in our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in
-
depth professio
nal development in the California ELA/ELD framework. 
The ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English langu
age learners and the 
need for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculu
m and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have 
been delivered through teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and 
during indivi
dual teacher planning days.This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade
-
level teams, 
and through individual mentoring by the school administrator. In addition, Our counselors have received training on the
 
Sanford Harmony social
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms whi
le teachers support the 
implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received profess
ional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms 
in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. The District also assists in the coo
rdination of BTSA Induction Support 
for year one and two te
achers. Teachers who are experiencing difficultly or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program
.
