By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Manzanita Elementary School is a TK
-
5th grade school located 
in the City of Covina that serves the communities of 
Irwindale and unincorporated Covina with an enrollment of approximately 305 and growing as we grow our Dual 
Immersion Magnet Program. Manzanita is part of the Covina
-
Valley Unified School District, which
 
includes nine 
elementary schools serving grades TK
-
5, three middle schools serving grades 6
-
8, three comprehensive high schools, and 
one alternative school. We offer students a balanced, standards
-
based curriculum that promotes success and excellence 
in e
ducation. Manzanita teachers and staff focus on providing students with an array of opportunities to master the 
California State Common Core Standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics, in addition to the state standards for 
Science and Social Studi
es. Our school hosts the District Dual Immersion Magnet program and the Think Together after 
school care for the school age students that attend Manzanita.
 
 
Manzanita Elementary is a school of excellence where every student, in all capacities, is highly va
lued. Our focus has 
continued to be on closing the achievement gap for all underachieving students and enriching instruction for all students 
proficient or above. Our credentialed teachers provide after school tutoring sessions to all students. Our school 
demographics include 89% students of Latino descent, 6% White, 4% Asian and 1% other.  With 85% of our students 
socioeconomically disadvantaged and 22% learning English as their second language, the entire school community is 
committed to our students fini
shing their elementary education with their 21st Century skills in place to guarantee their 
future success.
 
 
Our three
-
fold goal focuses on the whole child through nutrition, physical exercise, and academic instruction. We are most 
proud of our "What I Nee
d Now" (WINN) program, which targets achievement in ELA and math. We feel that WINN, our 
model practice, is an exemplary program. Through our daily instructional practices, which includes our WINN time, 
students in Tier I receive enrichment activities, tho
se in Tier II receive specialized support, and those in Tier III receive 
intensive intervention. We are proud of our current journey towards closing the achievement gap for all students at 
Manzanita and assert that our innovative WINN will develop inquisit
ive and versatile lifelong learners who will achieve 
their academic potential.
 
 
Our instructional focus was developed through collaborative meetings and PLCs to review our school wide data. We are 
committed that all Manzanita students will read closely to 
determine what the text says explicitly, make logical inferences 
from it, and cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text as 
measured by i
-
Ready Standards Mastery Assessments. We are also looking how t
his can be used in Math to support 
students citing evidence when solving problems. We support our Dual Immersion students through the use of iStation 
which is a similar program to i
-
Ready and based on Spanish Language Arts Standards.
 
 
Our goal is for every
 
TK
-
5th grade student to infuse the use of Chromebooks/Lenovos into our instructional model. 
Teachers receive ongoing intensive professional development to infuse technology into their daily instructional model. 
We have implemented coding through Code to t
he Future coaching model. Each student in grades TK
-
5 focuses on a 
gradual release model of coding at their developmental level. Each trimester, we showcase our program through an Epic 
Build where student ambassadors highlight the program and invite parent
s to explore the learning in the classroom.

In addition to these foci, Manzanita houses the District Dual Immersion Spanish/English 90:10 model. For the past two 
years, Manzanita has grown this model starting with Kindergarten and opening two 1st grade cl
assrooms this year. 
Students are immersed in the target language and also gradually released to a 50:50 model by 4th and 5th grade. The goal 
of the program is to develop bilingual, bilateral and Multicultural citizens who are prepared to continue their lan
guage 
learning into middle and high school with the ultimate goal being the Seal of Biliteracy on their high school diploma.
 
 
Manzanita Elementary School is one of nine computer science magnet schools in the Covina
-
Valley Unified School District. 
Manzanita
 
is a one
-
to
-
one school where all students have their own Chromebook or Lenovo and are learning CODE as 
their second language. This year Manzanita is partnering with Code to the Future. Students in grades TK
-
5 use their 21st 
Century skills of collaboration
, critical thinking, creativity, and communication in an environment where computer science 
is taught as a normal discipline in the classroom.
 
 
Manzanita also received a grant from Mr. Holland's Opus to bring a music program to all students in grades 
3
-
5. Students 
are able to select Beats, Beginning Band or Advanced Band and Mr. Holland's Opus has provided instruments for any 
student wanting to participate.
 
 
The Manzanita staff is highly qualified with 100% of the teaching staff NCLB compliant, fully c
redentialed, BCLAD or CLAD 
certified (or its equivalent). Our staff includes three Special Education teachers in our Specialized Academic Instruction 
Programs. In addition, we have a part time Speech and Language Pathologist, a part time Adaptive PE teache
r, part time 
OT and a part time school psychologist . Manzanita also has a Title I Intervention Specialist who works with our 
socioeconomically disadvantaged population, coordinates and teaches our intervention program.
 
 
Our parents and PTA are important p
artners in our students' education. Our parents volunteer in the classroom, organize 
special events, and raise money to provide extra things that make school special such as field trips, parent nights, 
assemblies, movie nights, Festivals, Trunk

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern at every school throughout the District. Each school complies with laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous 
materials and state earthquake standards. The school's disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted regularly throughout the school year. Each school annually part
icipates in the "Great California ShakeOut". The 
school's Safe School Plans are reviewed annually by a law enforcement officer. Our document is "fluid" and updates are 
completed as needed. For example, updates are completed if a school discipline policy is
 
added or modified, changes are 
made to the campus map, additions and/or modifications are made to the telephone trees, etc. All visitors must check in 
at the school office and wear a visitor badge while on school grounds. During lunch, recesses, and befor
e and after school, 
staff members supervise students and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and 
orderly environment.  The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by administrators, other school staff 
members, a
nd Los Angeles County Office of Education staff members. It is reviewed, approved, and evaluated by the 
School Site Council in cooperation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan 
provides students and staff a me
ans to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan include the following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of 
dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures 
for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual 
harassment policy, and suspension and expulsion policies. The plan is reviewed annually with school staff. An updated 
copy is available to the public at the school and District Office.
