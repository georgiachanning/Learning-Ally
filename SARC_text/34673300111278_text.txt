By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Vision and Mission:
 
Navigator Elementary School vision is to inspire students to be life
-
long learners, to help students reach their full potential, 
and to teach students to make a contribution to their community and the world. Navigator

educational and social foundation in order to succeed in school and in life.
 
 
School & Community 
Profile:
 
Folsom Cordova Unified School District is comprised of two communities located in Sacramento County along HWY 50.  
With a population of more than 19,500 students, schools are an average of twenty miles from downtown Sacramento and 
just over 100 mi
les from San Francisco. Folsom Cordova Unified School District enrolls Preschool thru Adult Learners.   
There are twenty elementary schools, one charter elementary school, four middle schools, three comprehensive senior 
high schools, three alternative high
 
schools, and an adult school.
 
 
Navigator Elementary is one of 20 elementary schools in Folsom Cordova Unified School District.  We are located in the 
city of Rancho Cordova, a culturally and socioeconomically diverse city located approximately 15 miles ea
st of Sacramento.  
Built in 2006, Navigator was the first new school in Rancho Cordova in 40 years. We operate on a traditional schedule, 
August

were enrolled in grades K
-
5.  Current data shows the school's largest ethnic group is white, 35% which also encompasses 
our largest English Language Learners group who speak Slavic languages.  Other ethnic subgroups include, Asian at 24%, 
Hispanic 22%, a
nd African American 14%.   A distinguishing characteristic that sets Navigator apart is its large population 
of students with special needs.  We are home to three special day classes for students with autism.
 
 
At Navigator, we respect and celebrate individ
ual differences. The staff and administration are committed to inspiring our 
student body to become lifelong learners. Our school serves the needs of general education and special education 
students in grades kindergarten through fifth and we proudly offer
 
programs that serve the individual academic and Social 
Emotional Learning (SEL) needs of our students including Special Education, Transitional English, Speech, Occupational 
Therapist (OT), Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics (STEM), Intervention
 
Programs,  and after
-
school 
enrichment including the newly added Boys & Girls Club.  We are equipped to help our students with their social and 
emotional needs through the availability of our school psychologist (mentoring), our Marriage & Family Therapis
t (MFT) 
our Special Friends program (1:1 and group), the Lunch Bunch social skills groups, Falcon Patrol and our use of Steps to 
Respect curriculum in our classrooms.  Navigator is a Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) school.  We have a 
weekly b
ehavior focus broken down to daily lessons.  We teach Second Step curriculum in grades K
-
5.  All of our teachers 
were trained in Responsive Classroom and this year we will begin implementation of Professional Learning Communities 
as well as an expanded dis
trict led PBIS/anti
-
bullying program.
 
 
We currently have 3 kindergarten classes, 3 first grade, 3 second grade, 2 third grade, 1.5 fourth grade, 1.5 fifth grade 
classes, three classes for students with moderate to severe autism, and one learning 
center classroom.  We also have a 
full time credentialed intervention teacher and a physical education teacher.  To help address the social
-
emotional needs 
of our students we have a Primary Intervention Program (PIP) program and a part time school psycholo
gist.

Our curriculum is focused on teaching students the adopted California Common Core Standards in all grades.  Materials 
used in classrooms are state and district adopted materials.   We have Chromebooks for students to use in the classroom 
and are cur
rently at a 1:1 ratio.  Our classrooms for students with autism use the Unique curriculum which provides 
academic materials designed with their needs in mind.
 
 
Parent participation is encouraged to foster a close, cooperative relationship between home and 
school. Our Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) is active, providing many activities and events for Navigator students and families. Our 
Schoolwires webpage keeps parents informed about schedules, events and activities happening at school. Teachers 
maintain t
heir own page on our website which allows two way communication between teacher and parent and includes 
the ability for a parent to check grades and attendance. Frequent communication, regular conferences and parent 
involvement in the classroom all help to
 
build a positive learning environment.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on 
December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed b
y the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed
 
of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Navigator Elementary was originally constructed in 2006 and is comprised of 25 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, a library, a staff lounge, a computer lab, and three playgrounds. The principal works daily with the 
custodial staff of
 
two full
-
time and one part time staff members to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
district. A summary of these s
tandards is available at the district office for review.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient ser
vice and highest priority is given to 
emergency, health, and safety repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that discrepancies are reported in the 
inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remed
iation.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
compon
ents. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems. Since we are a brand new school, no Deferred Maintenance funds have been used on this school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is of primary 
concern at Navigator Elementary. The school is in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was 
last reviewed and updated on September 17, 2019 by the Scho
ol Safety Committee and on September 24, 2019 by the 

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster
. Evacuation drills are conducted 
on a monthly basis throughout the school year. Lock down and other disaster drills are held as needed.
 
 
Students are supervised before school, at recesses, and during lunch. Certificated and classified staff help with supe
rvision 
during lunch and break periods. There are designated areas for student drop off and pick up for both personal vehicles 
and school buses. Visitors and volunteers must sign in and out at the office upon arrival at our campus. At that time, 
visitors m
ust obtain and wear a badge or sticker showing that they have a valid reason to be on campus. Volunteers are 
processed according to district guidelines and are required to wear an ID badge which is kept in the school office.

service and training are provided through our Professional Development Academy (PDA) and other district 
staff.  This year the focus is on using Responsive Classroom morning meetings to foster and support the classroom 
comm
unity and on developing as a Professional Learning Community (PLC). Teachers can also choose from courses 
available through Go Sign Me Up. In addition, our district staff has worked collaboratively to implement our Peer 
Assistance Review (PAR) program, whi
ch works in unison with BTSA (Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment) to 
provide an induction program for qualified new teachers. We support our teachers in pursuing National Board Certification 
and currently have over 44 National Board Certified teacher

In addition: Teachers are supported through Every Child By Name meetings in which academic and behavioral data is 
reviewed and interventions are planned.  The principal regularly meets with staff to support professional growth and 
d
evelopment.
