By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Pride is evidenced on our campus by how neat and tidy s
tudents are keeping the grounds. The passage of our bond in fall 
2005 allowed the district to build a new school.  The Maintenance and Operations Department has done an exceptional 
job of maintaining the buildings and grounds. At this time, all classrooms 
have high speed Internet access, we have a  
multi
-
purpose gymnasium, a music room with a stage, and only one portable classroom. Our library has over 4,000 texts, 
and is continually updated and also includes a Maker Space area.

All after

hours custodial a
nd maintenance is completed by contracted service providers. Staff and students contribute 
significantly to the cleanliness of our campus through education and awareness programs. We are working towards a zero 
waste goal in our cafeteria. Solar Panels have
 
been placed at the school bus barn and and all indoor school classroom and 
office building have been updated with more efficient lighting systems. Everyone is proud of our clean and safe school.
 
 
The data used to make the determination of the school 
being in good repair comes from a completed Interim Evaluation 
Instrument, including the date of the school site inspection by the County Office of Education, the Interim Evaluation 
Instrument completion date, and the date of any remedial action taken or p
lanned. Additional information about the 
condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

Professional development opportunities for teachers are readily made available through the district, outside resources, 
and the 
County Office of Education. Each year staff is involved in choosing staff development needs. The district takes full 
advantage of minimum days and staff development time allocated in the state budget. During minimum days and staff 
development time, classif
ied staff often also receives training in areas of student safety and student 
instruction/intervention. Individual teachers work with the principal to set teacher's improvement goals. Teacher
-
principal 
interaction is frequent, cooperative and positive.
 
 
For
 
beginning teachers the Teacher Induction Program hosted by the San Luis Obispo County Office of Education, which 
is negotiated with the certificated (teaching) staff. This enhances our current evaluation, training, support processes, and 
staff development
. A large portion of the professional development time is currently focused technology integration, and 
social/emotional learning. Teachers are encouraged to attend professional development opportunities that most meets 
their needs both during and outside 
of school time. Teachers make a request to the principal and are offered assistance 
with making arrangements. The principal shares information regarding professional development opportunities as 
available.
