Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Crookham Elementary School is 90 years old and in goo
d condition. Our campus facilities, such as bathrooms, cafeteria, 
library, and the computer lab, are all used continuously. We have 16 permanent classrooms and 13 portables. Part of our 
ongoing maintenance is the replacement of carpet, whiteboards, and ver
tical blinds in our classrooms. We are proud of 
the students and staff at Crookham Elementary School and believe that they deserve a clean, safe, and attractive 
surroundings. A safety inspection  is done monthly by the principal and maintenance supervisor.
 
The cleanliness of the 
grounds and restrooms is outstanding and we have a person who checks and performs any needed cleanup during the 
time students are in school. The maintenance staff performs daily preventive maintenance. There are custodians on site 
d
uring the afternoons and evenings. The library has an excess of 46 books per student. Our students use the software 
Study Island for reading and math, as well as Reading Eggs for the younger students.  The software is  available for every 
student to work a
t his or her success level and at his or her rate.  In addition, we have a 1 to 1 chromebooks to student 
ratio at our school.  There is WIFI access availability in  the library, computer lab, and every classroom.
 
 
A preschool was added to our campus  in 20
04
-
05. It is a welcome addition to our educational program. The facilities were 
upgraded to meet State preschool standards.
 
 
At Crookham our teachers will equip our students with the necessary 21st Century skills in order to compete in a global 
economy. St
udents need to become proficient Communicators, Creators, Critical Thinkers, and Collaborators. Our literacy 
and math programs effectively provide our students with the necessary rigor to access the Common Core standards and 
acquire 21st Century skills.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

district Safety Plan is reviewed with the staff yearly during the 
first quarter of the school year.  The plan was last updated March 13, 2017 and will be in effect until 2022.  If new Board 
policies are adopted, those are shared with the staff immediately 
following the Board meeting.
 
 
The Safety plan includes specific plans for lockdowns, fires, earthquakes, and other major catastrophes.  Fire drills are hel
d 
monthly, with debriefing afterwards.  Lockdown and earthquake drills are held every quarter, also w
ith debriefing 
afterwards.  Visitors are required to register at the office before going onto campus.  Each visitor signs in and is issued a
 
visitor's tag, which is to be worn in plain sight while on campus.  Visitors also must sign out when leaving. The S
chool 
District Safety drills will be incorporated into quarterly practices.  The district updated the Visitor Policy this Fall, mak
ing 
each school a "closed campus" and update procedures for visitors on campus.
