By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP
, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princip
al or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As Principal of Cram Elementary School, I am pleased to present to the community our Sch
ool Accountability Report Card. 
In November, 1988, California voters enacted Proposition 98, which establishes an ongoing minimum funding guarantee 
for public schools and provides for the development and issuance of a School Accountability Report Card for 
each school 
in the state. The Redlands Unified School District Board of Education then adopted a policy in August 1989 that such a 

shall
 
be to communicate important information to parents and other interested parties in the community about each of 

-
establishment of 
Cram Elementary School
 
in 1997, we have had the opportunity to present our report card annually. Cram families and 
alumni take special pride in this school and its over 100
-
year heritage. Our active PTSA, School Site Council, ELAC and 
classroom volunteers all reflect this pride
. Students are motivated  to reach their full potential in safe, orderly, and clean 
classrooms and school. Discipline is strong and consistent; serious incidents seldom occur. The school focuses on behaviors 
of Character Counts, and has established specifi
c location expectations across our campus.  School spirit and positive 
reinforcement of good citizenship are rewarded through a variety of activities for students. While there are areas in the 
Report Card that highlight our program strengths, we have also 
continued to identify the area of mathematics and 
problems solving, as well as writing as a top priority for our program Cram Elementary School puts a strong emphasis on 
reading and language arts, as well as mathematics curriculum for our students. Based o
n the 2017
-
2018 CAASP data, the 
Redlands Unified School District has a focus on mathematics.  Cram Elementary School will align in this focus and provide 
specific professional development in this area.
 
As we continue in our second century of high quality i
nstruction for students at Cram Elementary School, this is an 
appropriate time to present to you our School Accountability Report Card, outlining our history, our current challenges, 
and the bright future for Cram students. School Summary Cram Elementary S
chool is administered by the Redlands Unified 
School District, which serves 150 square miles of San Bernardino County, one of the fastest growing areas in California.
 
The Redlands Unified School District serves fourteen elementary schools, four middle scho
ols, two comprehensive high 
schools, and one alternative high school. The total enrollment in the district during this year is over 21,000 students, 
kindergarten through twelfth grades.
 
Cram Elementary School has a rich history and traces its origins back 
to 1869, when the first school was built on land 
donated by Lewis Cram in the area known as Cramville. Andrew Cram (the first Lewis Cram child to attend the school) 

erely framing timbers and boards 

ve 
been five additional Cram Schools: 1878, 1882, 1902, 1958, and finally, 1997. The current schoo
l opened its doors to 
students on September 9, 1997, and houses approximately 660 students. The school is a combination of permanent and 
relocatable buildings, and includes a multi
-
purpose room, a library, a computer lab, administrative offices, and twenty
-
nine classrooms.
 

in a variety of programs and services at Cram Elementary School including instrumental music (grades 4
-
5), Gifted and
 
Talented Education (grades 3
-
5), Special Education (Specialized Academic Instruction and Language, Speech and Hearing 
services; grades K

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Students and staff work hard to keep our new campus clean and safe. A litter
-
free environment is emphasized; custodians 
clean the ca
mpus daily. A strong feeling of school pride and ownership is present as all take responsibility for the upkeep 
of our school.
 
 
The staff has worked to develop a comprehensive disaster plan for our school. Practice drills continue to take place each 
month 
to prepare staff members and parent volunteers in procedures for a disaster. The plan is communicated to students 
and to parents, and enables staff and students to remain as calm as possible as they deal with the events surrounding a 
disaster such as an ea
rthquake, flooding, or a fire.
 
 
The staff at Cram Elementary School and the Redlands Unified School District work diligently to maintain a safe, clean 
campus for students of our community to attend. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for al
l schools in 
RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. Whe
n 
maintenance and repairs are needed, the site custodians are notified or work orders are submitted to the district's service 
center where district personnel are dispatched in a timely manner to make any necessary repairs.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings: Cram wa
s built in 1997.
 
School and staff work hard to keep the campus clean and safe. The appearance of our school has been enhanced by 
exterior painting, all school facilities are in good repair, and a litter/graffiti
-
free environment is emphasized by students 
a
nd staff. None of the eight emergency needs specified in Education Code Section 17592.72 exist.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of our school and the efforts made to continue to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe and 
functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repairs:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient 
service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in 
the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of 
the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully complet
ed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Cram is very fortunate to have the active 
involvement and support of our parent community. Parent volunteers support 
the Cram School program through our PTSA, School Site Council, ELAC, as classroom helpers, and by volunteering to serve 
on a myriad of committees, both at the school and district le
vel, including, but not limited to our Safety Committee and 
our PBIS Committee. There are also many family activities sponsored by the PTSA and staff that enable parent and 
community envolvement. Some of the events sponsored by our PTSA and school funds in
clude a welcome back ice cream 
social and Book Fair, Family Movie Nights, Family Dance,  Annual Carnival, and "Reflections Night." Staff sponsored events 
include One School, One Book family reading program, California Math Festival Night, and Geography fam
ily night, as well 
as the Cram Holiday Program. In addition, each classroom performs a curriculum related stage performance once a year 
for our families from plays to puppet shows. We connect with parents on academic performance through parent/teacher 
conf
erences, IEP, and IST meetings, phone broadcasting messages, and on
-
line progress reports in most classrooms. 
Parents are welcome to volunteer in classrooms as well and in our school library.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cram School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to evaluate the 
current status of school crime. A Safe School 
Plan is adopted in March of each school year and is reflective of the school's 
safety needs.
 
 
The key components of Cram's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline policies and procedures, dress 
code guidelines, suspension and expulsion 
policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, 
dangerous pupil notification, and lock down, disaster response procedures.
 
 
Cram Elementary School staff has a close working relationship with the Highland Division of the San Bernardi
no County 
Sheriff's Department who assist whenever necessary.
 
 
To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, teachers, and administration supervise the school grounds 
including the single point of entry, cafeteria, and playground. During the sch
ool day all entrance areas to the school are 
locked with the exception of the front entrance, which is near the administration office. Signs are posted to indicate all 
visitors must report to the administration office and may not be on school grounds unles
s they have a visitors pass.

After school, teachers help to supervise outside of their classrooms, the pick
-
up line, and the bus pick
-
up area. Two 
teachers, and the Principal supervise the areas until all students have left the campus for home. 
Surveillance cameras are 
in place throughout the school campus to monitor various access points.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Currently recognized critical needs are:
 
Funding Due to economic factors 
throughout the California school community, our school does not generate some of the 
state and federal funds that are common to other school. We must look for other funding sources such as special grants 
or our PTSA and community programs such as the REP F
oundation.. Selecting and prioritizing areas of spending often 
requires making difficult compromises.
 
 
A strong focus on Informational Text and Conceptual Understanding in Mathematics requires cyclical professional 
development and planning so all students 
can meet grade level standards in reading, writing, and mathematics. Our 
Language Arts and Math textbooks and curriculum, as well as our school wide writing program will be a crucial part of this 
curriculum focus.  This is a costly but highly effective inv
estment for our school. Much of the money to support the new 
technology for our school is raised through PTA fundraisers, school fundraisers, and grants such as those through the REP 
Foundation. Training for the teachers on the use of this technology, and 
highly effective teaching strategies is a priority 
for our school.
 
 
As we have entered school wide Title I, we have received Title I funding to help increase achievement in language arts and 
mathematics.  This funding is utilized to develop a Tier II 
intervention program for students who are struggling with early 
literacy and foundation skills, reading comprehension, as well as mathematics.  Support personnel, as well as specific 
materials, are used to provide students with small group intervention bas
ed on their specific needs.
 
 
Cram teachers will continue to work closely to ensure all students are able to meet state grade level standards in all 
curriculum areas. Teachers participate 5 times per year to review district assessments on the grade level st
andards. In 
these meetings, teachers look at which students and which standards need more concentration. Collaboratively they 
discuss what the students are expected to learn, how they know the students are learning and comprehending the 
information present
ed, how will the teachers respond for those students who are not learning (intervention), and how 
will they respond if they already know the information (acceleration)
 
 
Each Cram student will demonstrate strengths and academic growth in Reading and Mathema
tics using a variety of 
assessment methods including the Redlands Unified School District Common Assessments, the yearly state standardized 
test (SBA, including the SBA Science for 5th grade), observation of performance, and teacher
-
made assessments.
 
Cram 
students will be provided with activities that will demonstrate the relevancy of technology to their daily lives. This 
will be accomplished through the use of classroom technology (classroom computers, classroom laptops and tablets, and 
Smart Boards and Pr
oWise Boards). Strategies will incorporate the use of our networked programs, software, Google 
Applications, such as Google Classroom, and Internet access.  This year Cram has developed and implemented the Cram 
Creation Lab, in which all students have the 
opportunity to visit and engage in projects that revolve around building, 
circuits, as well as robotics and coding.

Cram students will participate in an increased number of activities, which will improve their self
-
esteem, school spirit, and 
sportsmanship
. Our Monthly University Pep Rallies, Monthly University Contests, Pizza with the Principal Lunches, 
"Principal's Recess", and spirit days are some of these activities.  Students are able to earn Cardinal Slips for positive 
behavior, which they may use to 
"purchase" items from the Cardinal Store each Friday.

going professional growth for staff is a priority for Cram Elementary School.  
Through the LCAP Program, shortened 
school days have been planned for staff development. Continued support in the adopted language arts and math 
textbooks and training on the use of these materials, as well as current research
-
based strategies for implemen
tation 
continue to be a priority for the staff this year, as well as ongoing analysis of state and local assessment results. During 
the 2019
-
2020 school year, there is a specific focus on mathematics, more specifically how to administer math talks, 
problem
 
solving strategies, as well as effective math vocabulary instruction.
 
 
Professional development is offered through a variety of means.  Teachers have the opportunity to attend District 
sponsored professional development.  Each teacher at Cram has the oppo
rtunity to attend one professional conference 
(approximately 2 days each).  Each month, professional development is provided at the school sites during minimum day 
instruction. There are 8 minimum days used for professional development at the school site. 
  
Teachers also meet after 
school, each week for data analysis and collaboration.  Once a year, we have an additional full day dedicated to 
professional development.  The agenda for the day is based off of school goals and needs.
 
 
Teachers are provided opp
ortunities to collaborate and plan in grade level teams to better comprehend and put into 
action what is learned during our Professional Development time.  During the 2019
-
2020 school year, teachers also have 
an opportunity to participate in lesson studies
.  These lessons students, completed in grade levels, focus on problem 
solving strategies and math talks.  This is an opportunity for teachers to plan a lesson together utilizing specific strategi
es, 
observe the lesson being taught, as well as time for ref
lection.  The school administrator is part of this process, guiding 
the conversations.
