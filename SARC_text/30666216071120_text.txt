By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

academic achievement, materials, facilities, and the staff. Informati
on about Orange Unified School District is also 
provided.
 
 
Nohl Canyon is a diverse, unique school tucked away in the hills of Anaheim. With approximately 530 students of diverse 
ethnicities and home languages, our community prides itself on high achieveme
nt across all walks of life. Our school has 
a veteran staff in 18 Kindergarten through sixth grade classrooms, three of which are designated for gifted and talented 
(GATE) identified students. In addition, Nohl Canyon offers a resource specialist program (
RSP).
 
 
Our staff is a group of dedicated professionals who meet weekly on Wednesday afternoons to discuss individual student 
support, analyze data, map curriculum and standards, receive professional development, and differentiate lessons for 
students, amon
g other topics. Teachers are specialists in their grade levels and hold high expectations for students; they 
collaborate on a continuous basis to meet the needs of each and every student, whether for intervention or enrichment. 
Of particular note is the fa

California State Teacher of the Year. While Mrs. Horist is an amazing teacher, she is one of many incredible professionals 

have sent their own children to attend Nohl Canyon which, in itself, is a high 
compliment.
 
 
An extremely high level of parent involvement is evident on a daily basis at Nohl Canyon. While walking through the 
classrooms numerous parents can been seen each d
ay, working with groups of students on a project, helping to correct 
papers, or doing Art Masters lessons. Our active parent group, Nohl Canyon School Association (NCSA), supports students 
academically (in Traveling Scientist assemblies, for example); cult
urally (teaching Art Masters and a bi
-
weekly music 
program); and through after school enrichment programs (Outdoor Science School, Vex Robotics program, etc.). Nohl 

-
do lists are addressed during 
a monthly workday. As the 

 
 
More than anything, anyone who visits Nohl Canyon recognizes that it is a special school with a heightened sense
 
of 

 
planter filled with seasonal flowers and various bulbs (planted by the Garden Club), observe teachers challenging their 
studen

recess with smiles and kind words. Nohl Canyon has a long list of accomplishments it has earned through the years, most 
recently as a Califo
rnia Gold Ribbon School and a California Distinguished School.

Student Achievement:
 
Ensuring all of our students achieve and make progress is a continuous process at Nohl Canyon. As we embark on adding 
new goals, we continued with our 
objectives that prove to be effective. Kindergarten through 6th collaboration and 
articulation of student work and data, along with utilizing Thinking Maps, standards based instruction, and collaborative 
inquiry. We also implement Response to Intervention 
and Instruction, including a Collaborative Academic Support Team 
(CAST) and RTI grade
-
level groups focusing on reading comprehension. With these goals in place, we were able to instruct, 
monitor, and evaluate student progress in small groups. Teachers also
 
collaborate with one another, and analyzed student 
assessment data so all students learned in deeper more meaningful ways. This enabled us to help close the achievement 
gap for all students.
 
 
Student Engagement:
 
Grade
-
level teams, along with our Education
al Specialist and Instructional Assistants, provide additional classroom support 
through small group interventions, enrichment, and flexible student grouping, during a 30
-
45 minute block, 4
-
5 days a 
week. Each grade level had a specific time block for RTI.
 
The focus during this time is English language arts standards, with 
a strong emphasis in non
-
fiction text comprehension through writing.
 
 
Safe and Welcoming Schools:
 
Nohl Canyon is extremely fortunate to be the recipient of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundat
ion grant for the Caring 
School Community program. We received approximately $15,000 (during the 2011
-
2012 school year) in materials for each 
classroom and staff development training, and it is a program we continue to promote a positive school culture and
 
reduce 
behaviors
--
specifically bullying
--
to this very day. The Caring School Community (CSC) program builds community among 
students, faculty, and families with common expectations, language, and structures. Implemented school wide, CSC 
improves the schoo
l climate, making it a place where the sense of connectedness is felt throughout the entire school. In 
a caring school community, students learn to take responsibility for their own learning and behavior; they also learn the 
shared values of fairness, help


class meetings, a cross
-
grade 
buddies program, home side activities, and school wide community
-
building activities that connect the home and school
-
support that learning.
 
 
VISION:
 
Fostering strong char
acter and a passion for learning in a student
-
centered environment.
 
 
MISSION STATEMENT:
 
As a school community of staff, teachers, students and parents, we will foster student engagement, utilize innovative 
learning strategies and create a caring school com
munity that extends through all classrooms and activities. Using the 21st 
century essential skills of critical thinking/problem solving, communication, collaboration, and creativity/innovation, we 
will nurture individual talents and design inquiry
-
based le
arning activities for students to display their original thinking. 
Inherent to our process are opportunities for students to exhibit their motivation, leadership and integrity as they develop 
into motivated, independent and emotionally intelligent young ad
ults.

Parent and 
Community Partnerships
 
The school staff and community works hand
-
in
-
hand with our parent group, Nohl Canyon School Association (NCSA). The 
mission of NCSA is to build a relationship between the home and school, and to provide resources to the school which 
enhance and enrich the educational program and enables students to grow academically, physically and emotionally. 
NCSA provides an opportunity for the school community to come together by hosting schoolwide events including a 
Carnival in the Spring and a J
ogathon in the fall. NCSA also sponsors community
-
building events like "Donuts with Dads" 
and "Muffins with Mom." Additional programs that are sponsored by NCSA are Traveling Scientist (hands
-
on science 
assemblies), Art Masters, and a weekly music program 
for all students in Kindergarten through 4th grade. All of these 
programs are provided as a result of fundraising efforts by our parents, students, and staff.
 
 
Parents also participate on the School Site Council (SSC) which meets multiple times during the 
school year. The SSC 
oversees the School Improvement Program, which addresses the development and evaluation of the 
School Plan
 
for 
Student Achievement. As part of our District's LCAP, input is collected from as many parent groups and community 
stakeholder
s as possible (during meetings both in the morning and the evening).

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each 
school develops and adopts, in accordance with Education Code § 32280 

 
32289, a Comprehensive Safe School Plan 
pertaining to their site. By March 1st, sites are required to have the School Safe Plan approved by the School Site Council 
and submitted to the
 
District office through School and Community Services. SCS provides plan development and 
assistance to the schools and maintains a file of individual school plans available for inspection by the public. Embedded 
into the comprehensive disaster plan are fi
re and earthquake drills, which are conducted monthly. Nohl Canyon is linked 
through an emergency radio contact system with the District Office. Radio drills are held periodically in order to be 
prepared for an actual disaster.  The "REMIND" app was instit
uted at Nohl Canyon with all staff.  The Emergency Remind 
is used to communicate with staff via cell phones when an emergency is occurring and to provide updated information.
 
 
Nohl Canyon is a closed campus and once the school day starts, gates are locked,
 
providing only one entrance through the 
main gate to the office. All volunteers must check in using our "RAPTOR" system, visitors have their drivers license scanned 
through our computer to insure they are safe to be on campus. Providing a safe environment
 
for students is a primary 
concern at Nohl Canyon. Teachers are on duty before school, after school and during recess. Noon supervisors that provide 
supervision for students during lunch are trained in their duties and meet to discuss any safety concerns. 
The principal is 
highly visible on the campus during recesses, before school, after school and in classrooms. A safe traffic flow and 
pedestrian plan for the school parking lot has been developed with active parent volunteers directing traffic in the morni
ng 
and afternoon.

Collaborative Academic Support Team (CAST) 

The CAST process assists in monitoring and supporting students through 
the RTI model. It focuses specifically on providing interventions and monitoring before students fall beh
ind and are 
misidentified for special education. CAST members devote more time to prevention and consultation activities rather than 
special education eligibility once students have failed. During CAST meetings, the completed action plan will be 
establishe
d. Action plans are specific to student needs and include follow up steps for team members, recommended 
academic and/or behavioral interventions, and a follow
-
up meeting date.
