About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each yea
r, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prioriti
es. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Shirley Lane Elementary School are currently being aligned to the Common Core St
ate Standards. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by t
he State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Thursday, September 12, 2019 the Fairfax School District's B
oard of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks and 
instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution No. 2020
-
01 which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that t
extbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the district to the extent
 
that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks
 
and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content of 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and
 
English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, the Fairfax School Dis
trict did not offer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not require the 
distribution of respective textbooks and instructional materials.

t the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good condition are completed promptly. A work

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
