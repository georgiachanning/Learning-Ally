By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that 
all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensu
re efficient service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.   A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school's needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, 
Measure D, and state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Austin Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. Village School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as
 
recent replacement of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the other five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, cabinetry, heating 
systems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker b
oards. Each multi
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media centers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administrative wing of each school was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs,
 
a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.

During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure F and local reserves were utilized for modernization of the 
Matanzas campus.  Included were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled offi
ce complex, and 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction of several classrooms, including a 
shared music building.  In August 2017 the Madrone and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a mus
ic room.  A new play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made to the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Village opened up with a major renovation to the classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, 
and landscaping improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the schools, with the other schools to be completed in the next two years.  All schools have now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will
 
receive improvements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Board has identified the following as key goals for the Measure F program. To ensure the 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable cl
assrooms with modular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency components such as HVAC, lighting, and window systems.
 
 
Cleaning standards have been adopted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance
 
and Operations 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cleaning standards are being upheld. In 
addition, the principal communicates daily with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
p
roactive with maintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under this plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the
 
State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent 

to involve parents, grandparents, caregivers, community volunteers and organizations through multiple venues. Our 
annual Fine Arts Day allows com
munity volunteers to share their artistic vision and talent. Art docents provide year
-
long 
in
-
class enrichment. The school is filled with community volunteers who read and help tutor children to reinforce our 
rigorous curriculum. Visiting the Whited campus
, one will see adult volunteers working 1:1 with kindergarteners to master 
alphabet recognition, reading with 1st graders, or extending third grade curriculum using Jr. Great Books, for example.
 
 
In addition, there are several committees that encourage and
 
include active parent participation.  The Parent Teachers 
Organization (PTO), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), School Site Council (SSC) and the District English 
Language Advisory Committee (DELAC) meet regularly. The Latino Literacy Project is
 
offered to parents to help those 

members from each school site, and provides for parent input to the Superintendent and Governing Board reg
arding 
programs and priorities for the District.
 
 
All parents are invited and encouraged to attend Back to School Night and yearly Parent Conferences. In addition, we hold 
yearly celebrations for the school community including Winter and Spring Concerts, The Fall Festival, STEAM Night 
(Science, Technology
, Engineering, Art, Math) drama productions, Multicultural Night and Open House.
 
 
Finally, it is worth noting our neighborhood partnerships enhance community connections and support student learning. 
Whether it is our local Valley of the Moon Rotary Club r
eading weekly to first grade students; kindergarteners performing 

e 
as examples of community connections with the Whited community.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP). With a focus on High Quality Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of annual inservice, 
monthly "Distri
ct Wednesday" workshops on topics of interest/need (8 total), approximately 20 district
-
sponsored after 
school trainings annually, and 2
-
3 planning days throughout the year. A critical component of our professional 
development plan is coaching and mentorin
g through our Consulting Teacher program.  In addition, professional 
development opportunities are offered through attendance at Sonoma County Office of Education classes and educational 
conferences. For 2017
-
18, our topics of focus are English Language De
velopment, Technology Skills, Common Core ELA 
and Math standards implementation, and an incremental roll out of the Next Generation Science Standards.

Austin Creek and Rincon Valley has been focused on improving our math scores for students in grades 3
-
6 as measured 
by the SBAC, and improving English language acquisition for our English learner students as determined by our re
-
designation
 
rates on the former CELDT and current ELPAC tests.
 
We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards these goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic growth for our English learners we use the Ren
Learn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting grade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC and the SBAC to review the effectiveness of 
ou

math progress by reviewing Eureka Math end

-
module assessments, students in grades 1
-

placement tests two times per ye
ar, and students in grades 3
-

Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the LCAP. With a focus on High Quality 
Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three
 
full

days of professional development trainings, 2
-
3 grade level planning 
days yearly, 8 monthly "District Wednesday" professional development sessions, and approximately 20 district
-
sponsored 
after school trainings.   Teachers can also attend professiona
l development opportunities through Sonoma County Office 

 
Teachers are supported in meeting our LCAP goals with coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher Program, 
teacher
-
principal meetings, an
d grade level PLC teams.  The support is focused analyzing student assessment data to plan 
curriculum and make instructional choices which support teacher and student growth.
 
During the 2017
-
18 school year the district administration and school site princi
pals participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with the 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions of Teaching and Leadership.  The administrati
on team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in our classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this professional development to include two 
teachers 
from each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional 
development in the framework through CEL.
