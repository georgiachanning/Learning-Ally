By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Edison Academy of Differentiated Learning is one of thirty
-
two schools in the Ontario
-
Montclair School District. Edison is 
located in the northern portion of the district and serves students from Ontario and Upland. It is one of the smallest 
phy
sical plants in the district and currently has fifteen portable classrooms in use in addition to the permanent buildings, 
bringing the total number of classrooms to thirty
-
one. Edison Elementary School received the Title I Academic 
Achievement Award in 200
7, 2008, and 2009. Edison w as chosen by the Campaign for Business and Education Excellence 
(CBEE) as 2017 and 2018 Honor Roll recipients. In addition, Edison received recognition as a Five Star School from the 
California Association of Gifted Learners in 
2015 and became a Gold Ribbon School through the California Department of 
Education that same year. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 consecutively, Edison became a Positive Behavioral Intervention and 
Supports (PBIS) Gold School.
 
 
There are thirty classroom teachers
 
and one full
-
time resource specialist at Edison. There are also two administrators 
including the principal and elementary administrator. Local control and categorical funding provides for the support 
services of a part time counselor, librarian, and two m
entors. Additional support its provided by the administrative 
assistant, the school office assistant, an additional part time office assistant, and health services assistant, two full tim
e 
custodians and one part time custodian, three part time cafeteria w
orkers and five noon aides. In addition, the district 
provides a physical education teacher and four physical education aides, an instrumental music teacher, a school nurse, a 
psychologist, a speech/language specialist, and a speech aide on a part
-
time bas
is. Students, staff, and parents work 
together to promote academic excellence. To prepare students socially, emotionally and academically, the development 
of self discipline and individual responsibility is essential. Edison School's programs are designed 
to focus on achievement 
through responsible learning. Academic goals for our students focus on the achievement of identified standards in reading, 
language arts and math, English proficiency for our English language learners, and the development of behavio
rs reflecting 
physical, social and emotional well
-
being.
 
 
Student progress is monitored by a variety of means. On a yearly basis, the CAASPP (California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress) provides data for third through eighth grade students. 
Edison also utilizes data from the 
common site and district assessments in reading, writing, and mathematics to plan for program improvements and 
develop school
-
wide focus areas. Teachers participate in data and planning meetings following assessments to d
iscuss 
results and determine grade level practices and next steps. Edison is developing a multi
-
tier system of support to provide 
appropriate services to all students. School
-
wide programs include Reading Counts for all students and leadership 
opportunitie
s for upper
-
grade students. We have an Elementary and Middle school sports program and participate in a 
variety of events including science fair, spelling bee, Read Across America, and Red Ribbon Week. We host trimester 
awards to recognize students for aca
demic achievement, participation in extra
-
curricular activities, and attendance. 
Edison established a PBIS citizenship program called "Choose the Right Path" to promote positive behavior in motivating 
ways for students. Students are recognized weekly for C
hoosing the Right Path and demonstrating Respect, Responsibility, 
Honesty, and Integrity.
 
 
Decision making is guided by the following vision and mission at Edison Academy:
 
Vision: Empower students to become successful citizens.
 
Mission: Through Innovative 
approaches to teaching and differentiated instruction, we will promote deep and complex 
thinking, responsibility, and collaboration.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether t
hey received a score or not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Edison staff recognizes the importance of parent partnerships and involvement in the educational programs and services 
for children. Parents are encouraged to become actively involved in their child's learning exp
eriences. Through ongoing 
two
-
way communication, we strive to foster a partnership for learning.
 
 
Parents are provided ongoing suggestions for supporting their children's learning efforts through class and school 
newsletters, as well as site and district s
ponsored parent education and involvement activities. Participation in individual 
classroom activities, along with attendance at School Site Council (SSC) and School English Learner Parent Advisory Council 
(SELPAC) meetings are encouraged. SSC and SELPAC m
eetings provide an avenue for site
-
specific dialogue with the 
principal, along with involvement in the joint development of Edison's School Plan and evaluation. Edison has an active 
and supportive Parent Faculty Organization. Their fundraising efforts have
 
benefited Edison's student body through 
community building and enrichment opportunities.  Parent meetings for Special Education, GATE, Title I, Principal's Coffee, 
and other parent workshops are held at the beginning of the year and throughout each school
 
year. Additionally, 
community events, dances, sports activities, and other extracurricular events afford parents many opportunities to be 
involved in school activities.
 
 
Information about current events and school activities can be found on the Ontario El
ementary School website, flyers and 
Twitter account.  The school mails important news and announcements to parents at home, uses the school's automated 
telephone system to contact parents verbally, sends text messages to parents via Blackboard Connect and 
social media 
such as Twitter.  Parents who want more information or wish to participate may contact our PFO president is Mr. Rene

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Edison Academy in collaboration with local agencies and 
the district office. Edison partners with parents and staff to review and update the school's Safety Plan. Components of 
the plan include: m
aintenance, security and safety of the physical environment, school climate which addresses disaster 
procedures routines, an action plan that ensures a safe physical environment and safe school climate, as well as our school 
safety compliance that ensures 
required child abuse reporting procedures, suspension and expulsion policies, due process, 
notification to teachers about sexual harassment policy, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, procedures 
to ensure a safe and orderly environment and 
rules and procedures on school discipline. Monthly disaster drills are 
scheduled and practiced school
-
wide to ensure student safety procedures.
 

 
School Safety Plan includes Emergency Response Team (ERT ) assignments for the year and procedures for 
earthquak
e, fire, AED, and lockdown/VIPER drills. A contingency plan for emergencies is contained in a 
handbook available to each staff member.
 

 
Each staff member receives an updated Disaster Preparedness information with ERT list, school map, and a 
brief descriptio
n of safety procedures each year.
 

 
Each classroom has a Safety backpack containing an updated class list, first aid supplies and disaster supplies.
 

 
Each classroom has a portable sanitation kit.
 

 
Edison participated in the Great Shake Out on 
10/18/19.
 
The plan reviewed annually by the school Site Council (SSC) and updated in response to developing site needs pertaining 
to student safety. This plan was recently reviewed and discussed with staff and approved by the School Site Council in 
January
 
2019.

Edison strives to set continuous rigorous goals that lead to student achievement. A leadership team is established each 
year with representation from each grade level, administration, and support staff. Meetings are held with teaching staff 
each year to de
termine a focus for professional development. Feedback from community surveys, school
-
wide benchmark 
and state testing data, School Site Council input, and input from staff are taken into consideration when developing goals.  
 
In the 2017
-
2018 school year,
 
a continued focus on gifted strategies across settings, differentiated instruction through 
questioning, and data analysis with goal setting were emphasized. In 2018
-
2019, a focus on vertical articulation planning, 
data analysis and universal design for le
arning in an Multi tiered system of Support was highlighted. In this current school 
year 2019
-
2020 Effective writing across subject areas with a focus on siting evidence was adopted. Enhancing 
collaboration techniques for improved engagement is also being 
stressed.  Teachers are being deliberate about sharing 
Learning Targets with students, and allowing for student's self
-
assessment and determination of their own abilities.  
Students will know what is needed to reach their Learning Targets, which will enhan
ce their inquiry and focus their efforts.  
Teachers receive feedback from administration and colleagues on a continuous basis. Data meetings support team 
members to identify areas of strength, the needs of students, and to improve instructional practice.  
Teachers are offered 
many district hosted PD opportunities, and given the ability attend the yearly CAG (California Association for the Gifted) 
conference.
