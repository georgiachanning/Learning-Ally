for reading.
 
 
Our school provides students a wide range of enrichment programs such as Chess Club, Lego 
Robotics, Stem Science, Choir, Band, Debate, Basketball, Soccer, and Math Olympiad, providing 
them ma
ny opportunity for extra curricular activities. Part of our school success is due to our

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have
 
enough books in core classes for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of 
Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Warwick Elementary was opened in 1972 with three buildings: a library and two classroom buildings.  In 1988, we added three m
odular classrooms; a 
ten
-
classroom building was added in 1994; and in 1997 a multi
-
use buil
ding, administrative office/kindergarten building, and two modular classrooms 
were added.  Additional modular classrooms were added to the campus in 1998 and 2001.  During the summer of 2008, the roof an
d fire alarm system 
were replaced and the restrooms w
ere retrofitted to be handicapped accessible, which involved tearing some of them out completely.  During the 2010

2011 school year, the playground, which was destroyed by fire in the summer, was replaced with new Americans with Disabilitie
s Act (ADA) comp
liant 
equipment.  A science lab was installed in the summer of 2011.  Our library started  a new program called Kaleidoscope in 201
7
-
2018. This year, we have 
extended it to lunchtime recess for grades 4
-
6. This is a chance for kids to interact with one ano
ther and have fun! I have a wide assortment of games, 
building blocks, and art activities. I will soon be implementing this after school, when students will have more time. I also
 
will be introducing technology 
in the form of Cubelets and Ozobots, and have
 
craft activities.
 
 
We have three full
-
time custodians who care for the facility.  With thorough scheduling and thoughtful planning, we maximize the use of our faci
lities 
and have numerous activities planned for each day.  The school is cleaned each night 
and inspected each morning.  The district maintenance staff work 
very hard to ensure that repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition and working order are completed in a timely m
anner.  They use a work 
order priority process to ensure efficient
 
service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  An annual safety check is conducted in each 

beautiful mural of
 
our 
mascot. In 2018 we had two Boy Scout Troops complete Scout projects: one was a mural of a map and the other were planter boxe
s. We added another 
planter box by the library as a donation from a teacher working on her master project.
 
 
To determine the c
ondition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called
 
the Facilities 

 
the questions you see on this report. 
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the

School Safety Plan
 
Our School Safety Plan was updated in November 2019.  Our Safet
y Team consists of a parent, three teachers, and one administrator.  Every August our 
administrative team reviews the plan with the staff.  Our Safety Team meets regularly to improve the safety procedures and pr
otocols at our school, 
which is on the cuttin
g edge in our school district.  Through our PTA and District Office has provided water and supplies for the student populatio
n in the 
event of emergency.  We have two highly organized safety containers on our campus to provide for any emergency situation f
or at least 72 hours.  We 
have a fully stocked safety shed with enough supplies for three days for 1,000 people.
 
 
We adhere to OSHA standards for reducing illness and injuries at our school.  All of our staff view a safety video each year 
and we display th
e first aid 
procedures chart in each classroom near our disaster information and evacuation map.  Safety at Warwick Elementary for all is
 
our number one priority.
 
 
The school
-
wide character education program, Project Heart, Head, Hands (H3), helps us 
reduce bullying and encourages conflict resolution.  This 
character education program is being implemented in all of our classrooms.  We have a character trait  introduced every month
 
as well as monthly 
assemblies tied to this trait.  We have an annual Abi
lity Awareness Assembly.  In October, we have an anti
-
bullying assembly that incorporates our school 
pledge  showing respect, making good decisions and solving problems. We also make sure we follow district monthly observance 
such as:  Red ribbon 
week, Afr
ican American history, Women history, etc.  In addition, we have student safety patrol that assists with morning traffic.
 
 

n 
order to minimize the risk of 
strangers being near the children.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some 
time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amoun
t of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
201
7
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
