Principal's Message
 
It is my pleasure to present to you Quail Summit Elementary School's Annual School 
Accountability Report

Accountability Report Card that fulfills state and federal disclosure requirements. Parents will find valuable 
information about
 
our academic achievement, professional staff, curricular programs, instructional materials, 
safety procedures, classroom environment, and condition of facilities.
 
 
Quail Summit is located in the beautiful city of Diamond Bar, approximately 28 miles east o
f downtown Los 
Angeles. Quail Summit Elementary School provides a warm, stimulating environment where students are 
actively involved in learning academics as well as positive values. Students received a standards

Ongoing evaluation of student progress and achievement helps us refine the instructional program so students 
can achieve academic proficiency. We have made a commitment to provide the be
st educational program

have about the information contained in this report or about the school. Together, through our hard work,

PBIS as Quail Cares

Be 
Responsible, Be Respectful and Be Safe.  Students are explicitly taught the specific behaviors for our PB
IS standards throughout our campus.  The common 
language and expectations for our PBIS have solidified our positive school culture and cultivated a school

wide effort from all staff members and students 
to show Quail Cares standards every day. Quail Summit
 
received the Platinum Award for excellence with PBIS implementation.

laboratively together to support student learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

of students who met or exceeded the standar

Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) 
appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too
 
small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who parti
cipated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who receiv
ed scores.

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Quail Summit Elementary School in collaboration with local agenci
es and the district office 
to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting procedure
s, teacher notification of dangerous pupil 
procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, an
d dress code policy. The 
school's most recent school safety plan was reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school staff in December 2019. Input for improved school safety was 
elicited from staff, parents and local first responders to help formulate a school safety plan specific to the needs of Quail
 
Summit. Safety measures are 
continually bei
ng reviewed and school drills for fire, earthquake, shelter in place are scheduled regularly. School Safety Committee meets r
egularly to 
discuss school safety.  In September 2019, the Disaster Bin was inventoried and obsolete or outdated materials were dis
posed of.  Community Club 
organized emergency bag orders and new emergency bags were order for over 500 students.  A new system, Lobby Guard, has been 
set up in the front 
office.  It does a quick check of all incoming visitors (Photo ID) to the Megan's Law
 
website. By installing the LobbyGuard school visitor management at 
Quail the visitor sign
-
in process is streamlined and more secure. It allows us to track everyone who enters our campus and help stop any threats at 
the 
door. In addition, our School Site S
afety Plan includes the addition of 75 cameras to help monitor our school campus outside of the classrooms.
