By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hahn is located on 
approximately ten acres adjacent to Honeybee Park. The school is made up of varied types of 
construction, with 16 portable classrooms and 3 permanent buildings that house 10 classrooms. School operations 
originally began in 1978 with three permanent classr
oom buildings. The MU was built in 1987. Additional permanent 
classroom buildings and the office complex were constructed in 1999. In the summer of 2008, two (2) portable classrooms 
were added to accommodate the increase in enrollment.  The YMCA program is
 
also housed in a doublewide portable on 
campus.
 
 
Like all District schools, the fire marshal, health department, and insurance carrier have inspected Marguerite Hahn. The 
reports are positive, and when problems are noted, they are addressed immediately.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p
riority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with
 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requireme
nts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Marguerite Hahn 
Elementary School has an open campus where families are welcome and encouraged to volunteer, 
participate in classrooms, and school life.  Principal Hankerson does second cup of coffee several times throughout the 
school year to encourage families to get in
volved and provide input.  Parents can learn about events through reading the 
Principal Newsletter, flyers that go home, the school marquee, and by calling the office 588
-
5675.  Parents were also sent 
a link to a parent survey in the Spring of 2019 as anot
her means to get parent input and feedback about the school.  
Parents were sent an additional e
-
mail with the results and findings of the survey.
 
 
Hahn also has an active and involved Parent Teacher Association (PTA) organization. The PTA sponsors 
family 
nights/events, walk and roll to school days, and support an art program for every child. Many parents are involved in the 
everyday life of the school, giving man hours of volunteer help in our classrooms, playgrounds, and office. With PTA 
involvemen
t we are able to provide a well
-
rounded educational program for our students.  Parents can follow the Hahn 
PTA facebook page, look for flyers in homework folders, signup to help using the signup genius website which goes out in 
the Principal Newsletter bef
ore events.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Marguerite Hahn School is a TK through fifth grade school in 
the suburb of Rohnert Park, a city of approximately 50,000. 
It is located in a middle class neighborhood of primarily single
-
family homes near a golf course and small, neighborhood 
shopping center. There is little crime in the neighborhood or on the campus
. It is important to us that we maintain an 
environment in which safety and security of our students is the goal of the entire community. In accordance with Education 
Code 35294.6.  Hahn's Safety Plan is reviewed, evaluated and amended each year by site co
uncil. The PTA has provided 
first aid and emergency materials, we also ask that parents send students with a bag of non
-
perishable food to be kept in 
the classrooms. The complete version of the School Safety Plan is available online and in the school offic
e.

proven best practices. 
Before school started, staff had training in Euerka Math, which is a newly 
adopted math curriculum, and English Language 
Arts, specifically looking at new curriculum for Walk to Read. In addition, Hahn has two afternoons per month for 
professional development, during this time staff has training in professional learning communiti
es (PLC), staff also uses 
this time to hold PLC meetings.  During PLC meetings, teachers identify a priority standard, share successful teaching 
strategies based on data, and plan instruction and next steps.
 
 
Our third grade team, spends time giving the Le
xia Rapid Assessment, and teachers use the data to plan instruction.  In 
addition, 3rd grade teachers are given training in Lexia. Our IT department  has also started monthly trainings for staff 
around specific computer skills/topics one time a month.  One
 

promote adult learning as prerequisite to continuous school and district improvement.
