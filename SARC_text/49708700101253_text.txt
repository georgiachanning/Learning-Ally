Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

and emotionally now and for the rest of their lives.
 
 
Jack London Elementary School, Piner

of a residential neighborhood with rural areas surrounding it. Currently, there are approximately 100 new homes under 
construction. The school has 280 students in kindergarten through sixth grade. A 
YMCA childcare program is housed in 
one of the classrooms and offers an after school program on the campus. The campus is also home to Piner

Olivet Charter 
School which is a school for seventh and eighth graders with 200 students in eight additional classr
ooms.
 
 
Our K
-
3 classrooms are capped at 24 students each.  Grades 4
-
6 have an average of 28 students per class. Instructional 
assistants offer reading and mathematics support to all students in each classroom based on the needs of our students, 
with an emp

access to 1:1 digital devices in grades 2
-
6.  Kindergarten and first grade have access to 2:1 devices in the classroom and 
may access other digital 
tools in the library as needed.
 
 
There are eleven general education credentialed classroom teachers, which includes two job
-
sharing assignments and a 
special education mild/severe credentialed teacher.   There are instructional assistants in general educat
ion classrooms, 
a resource specialist, and Title I and Title III ELL assistants for a total of eight support staff in special programs.   The
se 
program assistants also serve as yard duty supervisors.  We have full

instruction, support, and facilitate activities during lunch and recess. Some of our support staff are shared with the on
-
site middle school:  the resource specialist, school counselor, licensed vocational nurse, lead custodian, and the health

who dispenses medications, record updates,  and notifies staff of student medical information.  Music is offered 
with a credentialed music teacher two days per week.
 
 
Special programs include the Special Day Class (SDC), Resource Specialist Program, Engli

classrooms.  Our 
SDC classroom is a self

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Jack London Elementary school was constructed in 2003 and has been regularly maintained. The playground was relined 
and remarked during 
Spring 2010.   Solar arrays were installed on the campus during the summer of 2011 to help offset 
energy costs.   The parking lot was re
-
striped in the fall of 2012.   New lighting has been installed throughout the school 
for energy efficiency. The facilit
y was inspected by the Chief Business Official and the Supervisor of Maintenance and 
Grounds in February 2017.  There is a complete facility inspection and assessment currently in process and will be 
completed in 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Currently, the primary focus for professional development at Jack London Elementary School centers around Common 
Core English Language Arts and Math standards, and 21st

days during summer, and by full and half

day release days. Much professional development takes place in grade
-
level 
team meetings. Teachers are supported by site and district adminis
trators, district coaches, consultants, and District 
Director of Innovative Learning. Jack London teachers attend grade span and/or grade level meetings to assess and analyze 
student data and collaborate to plan instruction and intervention as well as dete
