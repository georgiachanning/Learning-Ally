School Description
 
Mission Elementary is a student
-
centered school, our goal is to make learning accessible to all.  We 
have an excellent school
-
wide reading program that supports all students, especially English 
learners and at risk students. Students learn reading in a var
iety of settings, which include targeted 
strategy groups. The school has a library of over 1,500 sets of developmentally appropriate leveled 
reading books.  Students who attend Mission learn grade level standards through integrated use of 
technology and Pr
oject
-
Based learning. Teachers at Mission help students develop 21st Century 
Skills by fostering critical thinking, problem solving, digital literacy and creativity. In addition, 
students learn to work in collaboration and to communicate effectively with t
heir peers and 
teachers using technology to expand their learning.
 
 
At Mission, staff, families, and community members collaborate to ensure a safe learning 
environment and maximize the academic potential of each student.  We promote individual 
responsibility and respect for others through character education, The 8 Keys of Excellence, and 
our four school
-
wide rules.  Clear established procedures are taught and reinforced on an ongoing 
basis.  Students are recognized in a variety of ways for thei
r good behavior and decision
-
making.  
Mission school promotes a safe and healthy way of life; fitness training and exercise are supported 
during PE and recess. Educational field trips and assemblies help strengthen real
-
world concepts, 
allowing students to
 
make new connections to the curriculum.
 
 
The entire teaching staff is committed to student success. Mission teachers meet each week to plan 
lessons, create assessments, develop differentiated (customized) instruction for students, and 
coordinate engaging 

student achievement makes Mission Elementary a place where all students achieve their full 
potential.
 
 
Mission Elementary was modernized in 2013.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every schoo
l in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local edu
cational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additional
ly, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.
cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
comm
unity members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

At Mission Elementary we encourage our families to participate in the education of their children.  Parent involvement is enc
ouraged through a variety 
of hands
-
on learning opportunities which include, pre
-
school and kinder par
ent orientation, parenting classes, back

to
-
school night, classroom visitations, 
fall parent
-
teacher conferences, family math night, science night, spring open house, family community programs, technology lessons, and 
district/community classes.
 
 
We encour
age parents to become school and/or classroom volunteers and/or participate in three main school level organizations, the Sch
ool Site Council 
(SSC), the English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).  The SSC is compo
sed of parents and staff who review 

of advising the principal and 
school staff on programs and services for English learners. The P
TO organizes fundraisers to help pay for student educational field trips, special assemblies, 
instruments, and 5th grade camp.  Parents also participate in the following district level parent advisory committees: Distri
ct Parent Advisory Council 
(DPAC) and
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).
 
 
At Mission there are many ways for parents and community members to help as classroom volunteers or in school wide programs.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Mission is a ful
ly fenced and gated closed campus.  Visitors must enter and sign in at the main office where they receive a visitor's pass to
 
wear while on 
campus.  Our Safe School Plan is revised each year and was last updated in May 2019.  We have ongoing committee meet
ings to plan and address safety 
needs and to review and update our crisis
-
response plan.  To ensure we are prepared in the event of an emergency, each month we hold a lockdown, 
fire, earthquake, or disaster drill.  In addition, our crisis response team wor
ks in coordination with district personnel and the Oceanside Police 
Department.  District maintenance staff and school custodial staff regularly inspect and repair equipment and school faciliti
es.
 
 
At the beginning of each school year and throughout the year, students are taught school rules and procedures so they can lea
rn and play safely at school. 
Keeping rules consistent across all grade levels sends a clear message to students and helps them mak
e safe and healthy decisions.  Good character traits 
are taught through The 8 Keys of Excellence (TK 
-
 
5th gr.) and Incredible Years lessons and activities  (PK 
-
 
3rd gr.). Good character and positive behaviors 
are reinforced through student
-
of
-
the
-
month a
ssemblies, attendance incentive programs, and a schoolwide behavior programs. Duty supervisors and 
parent volunteers are trained on active supervision and on the importance of reinforcing positive behaviors.  There is also a
 
team of staff members that 
plan
s and coordinates the implementation of the 8 Keys of Excellence and processes for anti
-
bullying, student self
-
regulation, positive communication, 
and restorative practices.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take time throughout the year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they te
ach. Teacher professional 
development is offered both at district and site level and is designed to meet the individual needs of ou
r teachers and grade level teams. The areas of 
focus for staff development are Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Science, and Project
-
Based Learning.
 
 
Implementation of grade level standards and instructional strategies is supported through Professional Learn
ing Communities, classroom observations, 
learning walks, and grade level team meetings with the principal.  Grade level teams review formal and informal student perfo
rmance data on an ongoing 
basis to determine student progress toward meeting grade level s
tandards and to determine additional instructional supports students need to reach 
grade level proficiency.
