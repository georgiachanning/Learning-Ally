By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Quailwood Elementary School enjoys strong parent and communi
ty support. The Quailwood Parent Club, School Site 
Council, and Advisory Councils meet regularly to plan, discuss site issues and implement projects beneficial to the school. 
There is extensive use of community resources in support of the educational progr
am. Quailwood Elementary is in the 
first year of MTSS, Multi
-
Tiered System of Support, implementation to evaluate and streamline systems to ensure 
appropriate academic support for all students. 
 
 


mission will be to maintain an environment where each of the following goals is achieved:
 

 
Students will be continuously encouraged, motivated, and respected for their individual differences.
 

 
Stude
nts will be provided with a wide range of academic and non
-
academic experiences to enhance their 
learning.
 

 
Teachers and administrators will continue to cooperate with parents to ensure students achieve not only 
academically but also develop personal values
 
of self
-
esteem, honesty, and responsibility.
 
Teachers and administrators will continue their commitment to innovative programs, parent education, staff 
development, and shared decision making. Quailwood has recently been recognized as a 2016 and 2019 Hono
r Roll School 
by the CBEE. We believe ALL Quailwood students can learn and achieve goals. They may learn differently and/or in varying 
intervals but with practice and perseverance, students will obtain mastery. We believe Quailwood teachers should provide 
purposefully driven lessons and hold high expectations for ALL students. 
 
 
All School Goals and Action Plans follow within the District LCAP Goals:
 
 
1. Implement Common Core State Standards to Maintain High Levels of Student Achievement and Prepare 
Students to 
Learn in a 21st Century Classroom
 
 
2. Increase Student Engagement and School Connectedness.
 
 
3. Increase Meaningful Partnerships with Fruitvale Families and Community.

continued parental involvement in the education of children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive 
school environment.
 
Parents support t

their students at home with their school work, attending conferences and providing a caring environment
 
Fruitvale encourages parents/guardians to serve as
 
volunteers in the schools, attend student performances and school 
meetings, and participate in site councils, advisory councils and other activities in which they may undertake governance, 
advisory and advocacy roles.
 
Parent Clubs at each school are curr
ently active in providing many activities for Fruitvale School District students. They 
work together to assist in school programs and community projects.  Please contact the school for specific information 
and opportunities for parent involvement.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is revised yearly taking into account staff changes as well as content revisions. The Emergency 
Preparedness portion of the plan is modeled after the State Standardized Emergency Management System. 
 
The plan is dedicated to the ongo
ing enhancement of all aspects of school safety including:
 

 
Maintenance of a safe and orderly learning environment by maintaining the buildings and grounds to a high 
standard.
 

 
Student transition to and from school with instructions on how to cross 
streets safely and a crossing guard 
posted by the school. Along with this, there is a Transportation Safety Plan that includes instructions on how to 
board and exit the bus safely, how the red cross
-
over lights are used and annual evacuation exercises.
 

 
Stu
dent behavior and discipline are outlined in the plan and is given to the parents and students via the 
Student/Parent Handbook at the beginning of the school year.
 

 
Disaster preparedness is accomplished by training the staff to respond to natural disasters 
or evacuations due 
to potential hazards. Many of the staff are trained in first aid and CPR procedures along with triage, search and 
rescue and student security in the event of an emergency.
 

 
Playground and classroom facilities and equipment are 
inspected annually with written reports of the findings. 
The play equipment has been inspected by a certified playground inspector and there is an ongoing 
maintenance program to improve the safety of the equipment. Quarterly inspection of the buildings, gr
ounds 
and play equipment is done by the Lead Custodian and documented on a standard form.
 

 
Student, parent, and staff safety training are done on an ongoing basis through in
-
services, fire and earthquake 
drills, and parent universities.
 

 
The School Safety Pl
an is written with input from all stakeholders and is reviewed by local law enforcement/first 
responders.
