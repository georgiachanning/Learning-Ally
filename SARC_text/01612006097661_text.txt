By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sunset Elementary School was built
 
in 1977. From 2005 to 2007, our campus was remodeled, adding four new buildings. 
The entire play area was also restructured to provide level playing areas. Solar panel installation was completed in October 
2018. New playground structures for our main play
ground area and kindergarten playground area were completed the 
summer of 2019 thanks to the Measure J Bond. Additionally, our computer lab has been converted to a Science, 
Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) lab for our students. Our li
brary serves all students from grades 
TK
-
5. Classes visit the library once a week to check out materials and get to know the services the library can provide. 
Computers and internet access are available in all classrooms and the library. iPads in grades TK
-
K and Chromebooks in 
grades 1
-
5 are available at a 2:1 student to device ratio, stored in mobile carts. Our two full
-
time custodians and a part
-
time custodian are dedicated to providing students and staff with a clean and sanitary campus which reflects th
e sense of 
importance it plays in the surrounding community. 
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and maintaining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore have passed three major funding m
easures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous and supportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond. Measure J funds will be used to:
 

 
Modernize classrooms, scie
nce labs, and educational technology for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
 
and Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade deteriorated hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to schoo
l facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities

Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate, modernize and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan. Facilities are maintained throu
gh the diligent efforts of the site custodial crews 
and the district maintenance staff. The LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
LVJUSD. The principal works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules t
o maintain clean and safe schools. 
District maintenance staff performs the repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely manner. 
A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the hig
hest priority.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Livermore Valley Joint Unified 
School District (LVJUSD) values active parent engagement and believes that parent 


rst and most influential teachers and that sustained parent 
involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school 
environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with staff and parents/guardi
ans to develop meaningful 
opportunities at all grade levels for parents/guardians to be involved in district and school activities; advisory, decision

Educational research suggests t

high levels and have more well

rounded educatio
nal experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcomed partners in our school 
community. There are a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activity boos
ter clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Information Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportunity for
 
parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information with par
ent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Committees (EL
ACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Advisory Commi
ttee, and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, and school
 
staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Parents are a very important part of the success we achieve at Sunset. Our parents serve on the School Site Council (SSC), 
which oversees our
 
School Plan for Student Achievement. The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) is at the center of our

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student safety is an issue that each site puts at the top of its priorities. We monitor all aspects of 
safety at Sunset, including 
equipment and use of the field, blacktop areas, and classrooms.  Three times per year, site safety walks are conducted to 
identify any safety concerns; work orders are placed with our maintenance department, as needed.  Monthly 
drills for fire 
and earthquake are held to aide with preparedness; lockdown drills are practiced several times per year to further ensure 
student safety.
 
 
Our safety focus also features a student valet program during morning drop off and adequate playgroun
d supervision 
before, during, and after school. All gates remain closed and locked during school hours. Visitors are required to sign in at
 

 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated, and discus
sed with the school faculty in November 2019.  Key 
components of the school safety plan include evacuation of buildings, student supervision and release, search and rescue, 
first aid, communication, fire suppression, and utility shutoff.

Our district recognizes that each employee

classified, certificated and management

influences the opportunities for 
students to achieve at the highest levels. In line with our District Professional Development Plan, we offer 
and support 
ongoing growth opportunities that allow every teacher, administrator, and staff member to further develop the 
appropriate knowledge, skills, and practices required to create learning environments that allow all students to 
demonstrate high leve
ls of achievement. Our Board of Education and our district administration recognize that all staff 
members of the LVJUSD must be provided time and support to acquire, improve, and enhance professional knowledge, 
practices, and skills.
 
 
During the 2019

2020
 
school year, relevant and timely professional development will be available and delivered to 
employees. In addition, two designated professional development days and the flexible professional development day for 
certificated staff provide the option of in
dividualized professional growth for teachers. Professional development will 
primarily focus on effective tier one instruction; Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), student and staff 
safety; customer service; meeting the needs of students w
ith Individual Education Plans (IEP); effective usage of 
technology as an instructional tool; effective instructional practices for English learners; and implementation of specialize
d 
programs such as Dual Immersion, Project Lead the Way, International Bac
