About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
co
ntains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which desc
ribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information abo
ut SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound educational program. E
valuations and formal 
observations are designed to encourage common goals and to comply with the 

probationary teachers are evaluated twice a year and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year.
 
 
Evaluations are conducted by the principal, who has been trained and certified for compe
tency to perform teacher evaluations. Evaluations are based 

in Learning; Understanding 
and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Le
arning; Assessing Student Learning; Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning; 
Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all Students; and Developing as a Professional Educator.
 
 
Due to the state fiscal 
crisis, additional funding from the State of California that would provide an opportunity to offer district
-
wide professional 

 
work
ed within the state 
fiscal crisis to provide an alternative plan of action for staff development, and has established a comprehensive District
-
wide Professional Development 
Center (PDC). The PDC provides ongoing staff development in a variety of formats th
roughout the school year (i.e. during the school day with substitutes 
provided, after school, on
-
site, weekends, and during instructional breaks). In collaboration with the PDC, teachers have access to online videos and 
resources as additional professional
 
development support.
