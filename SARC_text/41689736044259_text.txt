School Description
 
Spring Valley School is a dynamic, growing elementary school dedicated to ensuring the academic 
success of every student and 
providing a safe and comprehensive educational experience. The 
school has an energetic staff who pride themselves on the success of their students. The Spring 
Valley family concept is incorporated in the daily routine of the staff and has become part of th
e 

together for the benefit of the Spring Valley School children. Our PTA has grown into one of the 
most involved and productive associations in our area. We have ex
perienced an overwhelming 
response from parents inside and outside our attendance area who want their children to attend 

to prepare students for leadershi
p and responsible, productive participation in a changing world. 
This is accomplished by working in partnership with families and the community to help students 
become problem solvers and critical thinkers. We work together to promote the students' 
intelle
ctual, physical, emotional, social, ethical, and cultural development and have implemented 
a Positive Behavior Intervention & Support model. We continue to refine our implementation of 
the California Common Core State Standards and are currently focusing o
n writing as a way to build 
our students' capacity to express their development as robust thinkers. Science is also a major 
focus. We currently conduct a Science Fair for our third through fifth grade students that was very 
successful last year.    With an
 
eye on developing the Next Generation Science Standards, all grade 
levels participate in related field trips and hands on experimentation. We include  character 
education by focusing on specific character traits throughout the year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each y
ear, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCF
F) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priori
ties. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/gu
ardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

school office, between 
the second and third corridor; this
 
includes a playground area as well as new roofing. New walkways and rai

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

Millbrae School District provides two days during the school year for all 
teachers to attend professional development. This year, the focus is student 
wellness and implementing new curriculum. Students are dismissed early on Wednesdays to allow time for teachers to collaborat
e and support each 
other, both within and across depar
tment and grade levels. Teachers meet with the principal once a month or as needed. The focus is on student 
achievement; utilizing common assessments to gear instructional practices. Currently our staff is focusing on new Social Emot
ional Learning Program 
and 
piloting NGSS programs for adoption next year. In addition, teachers are planning units in all subject areas that correspond 
to the California Common 
Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards.
