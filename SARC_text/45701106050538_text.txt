School Description
 
This is Susanna Winstead's eighth year at Sycamore Elementary. She has been an administrator for 
fourteen years, and in education for 23 years.
 
 
Sycamore Elementary school is a No Excuses University, with the vision of Creating Successful 
Learners and Stew
ards of the World.  As a school community we believe that every student will 
achieve his or her potential social
-
emotionally, behaviorally, and academically.  We are committed 
to explicitly teaching self
-
regulation, citizenship, and social emotional learni
ng, as well as 
academics.
 
 
As a Capturing Kids Hearts district, we build positive relationships and create an environment for 
students to learn how to build positive relationships with each other, as well as adults.  We are one 
of three schools in our dist
rict to be honored by Capturing Kids' Hearts as a National Showcase 
School.
 
 
We have a college going culture and have the belief that we have the responsibility to prepare our 
students for middle school, high school, and ultimately their choice to go to co
llege, vocational 
school, or the military.
 
 
We are also proud to offer the choice of enrolling students in a dual immersion program, with the 
target language being Spanish.  It is a 90/10 model, where in TK
-
1 grades, 90% of the day is in 
Spanish and 10% in
 
English, then 2nd grade 80% Spanish and 20% in English and so on until 5th 
grade where students would be fully bilingual and bi
-
literate with doing all subjects 50% Spanish & 
50% English.
 
 
Sycamore Elementary school is committed, courageous, collaborative
, creative, character 
centered, and college crazy!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbook
s from lists that have already been approved by state education officials.  We use a district
-
wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrators.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislat
ion of 2004.  We report to the board in September and four times a year 
about the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether we had a textbook for eac
h student in each core 
course during the 2017

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify our facilities needs over the next deca
de. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
the Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bo
nd Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assist
 
with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program cal
led "Akita Box" is 
used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, t
he maintenance department 

 
 
S
ycamore Elementary School is a clean, safe, and inviting campus. Our site maintenance personnel maintain a very high standard
 
of cleanliness, and they 
clean classrooms, bathrooms, and the cafeteria on a daily basis. We enjoy relatively modern facilities th
at have undergone renovation during the past 
seven years.  The stage lift was replaced in 2016, providing alternate access to the elevated performance stage.  Kitchen and
 
Multi
-
purpose room and 
two pre
-
school rooms re
-
roofed in 2017.
 
 
During the past three
 
years we invested in a number of school beautification projects including murals, Peaceful Playground murals, wrought
-
iron fencing, 
and updated landscaping. We are also fortunate to have a jogging/walking path on our campus. We have concrete picnic tables
 
and benches in our snack 
and library courtyard areas.
 
 
The school is staffed with one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleanin

which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a monthly basis, the lead custodian uses a facility survey instru
ment developed by the 
Northern 
California Schools Insurance to evaluate the conditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the District Faci
lities Department which then 
does an annual evaluation for the site.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

School Safety Plan
 
The goal of Sycamore School is to provide a safe and secure learning environment for all students and staff. The SSC reviews 
our Safety Plan annually. 
We make sure that appropriate emergency responses such as fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are in pl
ace and practiced monthly. We share the plan 
with all staff members. The school community is kept informed of ongoing practice drills and other safety points through clas
sroom and school 
newsletters. Emergency preparedness is a responsibility that our enti
re staff takes very seriously. We have planned evacuation sites as well as procedures 
in place to secure our students in a safe environment if the need arises.
 
 
Sycamore School is a secure, fully fenced campus, and all visitors are required to check in at 
the office prior to entering the campus or classrooms.
 
 
Discipline
 
 
We take pride in maintaining a positive and safe learning environment, which involves the participation of every member of ou
r school community. We 
abide by our school's 
comprehensive Positive Discipline Plan as well as our district's educational policies. The California Education Code provides
 
us with 
the structural and legal guidelines on student discipline. We review our Positive Discipline Plan (PBIS) throughout the ye
ar, and we meet monthly with 
our school leadership team to evaluate student behavior. In addition, we have been working as a school site to learn more abo
ut being a trauma
-
informed 
school and recognize that many of our students may need additional support 
and/or intervention in social/emotional strategies. We have a unique model 
in that we teach students how to self

regulate and provide Social Emotional Learning.  We have a sensory room in which students are able to effectively 
use and practice these self
-
r
egulation strategies and then can apply them in their everyday lives. We revise the plan as necessary and keep it flexible to
 
meet the needs of our students and school community.
 
 
Our plan is designed to support the behavioral expectations we have for all 
students. We use proactive discipline programs and provide frequent positive 
reinforcement, including an incentive program in which students can become Masters of the Skills of Independence. We seek alt
ernatives to home 
suspension for suspendable offenses 
whenever possible and are in the implementation phase of Restorative Justice instruction. We support students 
through the discipline process, which does not seek to punish a student for behavioral incidents but rather provide logical p
ositive and negative 
consequences.

Types of Services Funded
 
Federal Title I funds allow us to provide a variety of resources and services for our students. Our primary focus is student 
learning and positive 
social/emotional development. School Site Council (SSC) sets the budget priorities for our school each year. 
We follow our 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement, and our goal is to improve English/Language arts and mathematics achievement to ensure that our students reach p
roficiency, as well as 
reduce our suspension rate by providing direct instruction in social e
motional development.
 
 
We receive Supplemental Educational Services (SES) funding through Title 1 to support students academically who are not yet r
eaching proficiency in 
grades 1st
-
5th grade.  We target the academic area of Math and have a math specialist
 
who provides small group tutoring to build necessary foundational 
skills that some students need.
 
 
One of the areas of funding that our SSC oversees, is the Supplemental and Concentration money through the LCAP.  It was reco
mmended and put forth 
as a moti
on to provide music in the primary grades, TK
-
2nd.  The SSC voted to utilize this money to pay for a music teacher who provides Orff music 
instruction to our primary grades, one day a week, along with other foundational music skills.
