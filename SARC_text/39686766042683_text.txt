About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year,
 
every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
a
ll local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities
. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The main building of Madison School was originally built in 1950. Portable classrooms 
were added at various times to accommodate a growing enrollment.
 
The school exterior was painted in 2008.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
e
d in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all clas
srooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools a
re clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy t
he requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Our school places a strong emphasis on ensuring the safety of
 

are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during a
 
close of school, during the 
summer or o
ther extended breaks. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal notifies appropriate site and district person
nel to resolve the 
emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness pl
ans. A site review with the district 
Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan helps to provide a secure, peaceful and clean environment for the school community. The sc

Emergency Manageme
nt for Schools (REMS) Plan identifies procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are 
conducted on a regular basis.  Our safety plan is reviewed and updated every year in Aug.  This year our plan was updated on 
Aug 20, 2
016.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, security m
onitors, teachers, site 
administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before, during and after school. The
 
playground is safe for all students. All visitors must 
sign in at the office, present photo identification and receive proper authorization to be on campus, and must display their 
passes at all times.
