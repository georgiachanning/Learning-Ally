Additional intervention classes are provided in the areas of

A
bout the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

ntion Support (PBIS) program 
is a component of our School Safety Plan along with specific information and responsibilities to be pe
rformed by staff in the event of an emergency or 
disaster.

Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 

of time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional developmen
t. This year we have been focusing on research 
based intervention programs, progress monitoring tools, data reflection and discussions of Common Core State Standards. Staff
 
is being supported by 
the Mendocino County Office of Education in the development o
f Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) and Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support 
(MTSS) The staff is also receiving professional development in the area of Unlocking the Reading Code and Unlocking the Gramm
ar Code to support the 
instruction of literacy 
and grammar. Three days per month, during our short days, teachers meet in Professional Learning Communities to review data, 
curriculum and plan for student success. During this time, staff also reflects upon needs for their programs.
 
 
Results of state, di
strict, and classroom assessments are analyzed to develop needed professional development for Blosser Lane Elementary School.
 
The 
site staff has focused upon:
 
1.  Align pacing guides with state standards/curriculum's
 
2.  Create and develop an intervention 
program for both ELA and Math that supports struggling students as well as implementing extension materials for 
students that are Proficient/Advanced
 
3.  Develop a school wide Writing program
