Description
 
We will provide an environment where students learn about themselves and the world around 
them, develop their potential, and acquire the skills necessary to become life
-
long learners.
 
 
We envision a school that provides an 
environment that focuses on high academic instruction and 
values responsibility!
 
 
Dwyer Middle School provides a stimulating, quality instructional environment for approximately 
1,300 students in the northwest section of Huntington Beach, six blocks from t
he ocean.  The Dwyer 
staff, over 90 members strong, is dedicated to the mindset that all students can learn and find 
success. We have created classes that help students achieve at this high level of performance. We 
are confident that with our help, student
s will master the challenging academic program we have 
created at Dwyer. We work collaboratively with colleagues, students, and parents to ensure that 
our academic programs continue to improve.  This continued our PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Interventions and 
Supports) program titled GRIT (Gratitude, Responsibility, Integrity and Tenacity) 
and began to develop the social
-
emotional component of Multi
-
Tiered Systems and Supports 
(MTSS).  The students were trained school
-
wide on the expectations of behavior and re
wards 
system, as well as teachers being trained on implementation.
 
 
In order to continue to raise the bar for all of our students and to close the gap for students with 
below grade
-
level skills, Dwyer teachers will continue a tiered approach to placing stu
dents in CORE 
language arts/social studies, math, and science. Students are placed in one of five possible literacy 
skill levels in language arts; one of six possible math skill levels, and one of two possible skill levels 
in science 
-
 
general education sc
ience at each grade level and one general co
-
taught science for 
select special education and English learner students. Each student is placed according to a multiple 
measures approach that includes on
-
going teacher formative assessment, GPA, SBAC assessmen
ts, 
teacher recommendations, district Benchmark assessments, and collaboratively created teacher 
assessments. When appropriate, students move between levels as skills improve or intervention is 
deemed necessary.
 
 
Dwyer has been fortunate to receive bond mo
nies from Measure Q to increase technology on site.  
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, Dwyer has had a complete technology integration and 
modernization upgrade in all the buildings and classrooms.  All the classrooms have Chromebook 
carts, collaborative s
eating, interactive boards and have been completely renovated with new 
furniture, paint, carpeting and infrastructure.  To address any safety concerns, camera systems 
have been upgraded and increased along with upcoming increased security fencing to be ins
talled.  
By spring 2020, the STEM Labs and multi
-
purpose room/athletic areas will have been completed.
 
 
Dwyer is a targeted Title I school and therefore supports two major interventions aimed at 
increasing student academic performance. Dwyer has instituted
 
an after
-
school tutoring service for 
all students who sign up to receive it. Students receive grade
-
level support from Huntington Beach 
High School National Honor Society members (through our library
-
media technician) who help 
Dwyer students who struggle 
in all subject areas. The second intervention is Extended Learning 
Academy, in which students are invited to a three
-
hour block to catch up on zeros and missing work 
with the assistance of a credentialed teacher. Dwyer is also using an academic incentive p
rogram 
named STAR (Students Taking Academic Responsibility), to reward students for their hard work.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information a
bout SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The administration and staff at Dwyer Middle School have a deep respect for community input a
nd a coordinated strategic plan has been developed to 
involve parents and other community members. Every fall, parents are invited to meet teachers at Dwyer's Back
-
to
-
School Night and gain an 
understanding of the vision, expectations, and practices in each
 
class.  In the spring, parents and the community are invited to Dwyer's Open House to 
see a sampling of each student's academic accomplishments. Throughout the year, there are numerous opportunities for parents 
and community 
members to team with staff and
 
develop the plans and policies that guide the school in technology, health and safety, drug and tobacco education, 
student achievement awards, and textbook adoption. The Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) and the School Site Council 
(SSC) regularly
 
collaborate with parents to help define school direction. The PTSA and SSC are only two of the many possibilities for parent 
involvement. At the beginning 
of the year, parents are given a list of areas on campus where help is needed and appreciated. Typic
ally, the school logs more than 12,000 hours of 
volunteer service, but as many as 36,000 additional hours have been provided. There are many ways in which community members 
interact with Dwyer 
students and offer their support to the school. Students from H
untington Beach High School provide tutoring services; local businesses donate prizes for 
the positive referral program; and senior citizens volunteer their time to help in the classrooms. Local businesses and organ
izations sponsor contests in 
art and writ
ing to strengthen student learning.   This year our community put on a fundraiser event called the "haunted basement", which 
was a fun

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to t
he State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with 
Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their safe school plans: 
current status and assessment of s
chool crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a high level of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notific
ation to teac
hers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and sch
ool rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and makes any modifications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Sa
fe School Plan, were 
reviewed with school and district staff at the beginning of the 2019
-
20 
school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 2020.
 
 
The district progressively addresses structural needs at each school to ensure facilities are safe and comply with education 
codes as well as building and 
saf
ety regulations. An automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administration building and new Gym/STEM lab.
 
A $169 million bond 
(Measure Q) approved in November 2016 provides the necessary funding for District
-
 
wide modernization efforts.
 
The Dwyer campus was under 
construction during 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 with major improvements including the renovation of all learning spaces, infrastructure, additional cameras, a 
reconfigured office entrance, and additional parking areas. Permanent campus 
perimeter fencing was completed during Winter 2019 to increase student 
safety.

All training and 
curriculum development at Dwyer Middle School revolves around the California Teacher Practices, the Common Core Standards and
 
Frameworks. Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed state proficiency levels. H
untin
gton Beach City School 
District (HBCSD) regularly collaborates with all levels of district and school site staff when developing professional develo
pment activities. Instructional 
program is driven by student needs and guided by state standards and framewo
rks. District and school administrators use site
-
trend analysis, state 
testing, district
-
level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to identify more effective methods and strategies to achi
eve positive 
results for teachers and stud
ents. Dwyer and HBCSD continue to support technology strategies through Digital TOSAs, Direct Interactive Instruction (DII) 
and on
-
going professional development from textbook publishers.  All new teachers on site will participate in additional training op
portunities to bring 
them up to speed with veteran teacher best practices and use of school strategies.

The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, i
nstructional materials, 
im
plementation time lines, and student achievement. Feedback is gathered at the site level through direct input and staff obser
vation. Periodic 
Curriculum Development Committees are formed to address identified areas of need and focus. During the 2019
-
20 sch
ool year, there are multiple 
district
-
wide staff development days scheduled to be held for teaching and classified staff. District
-
level training activities and professional development 
revolved around the alignment of curriculum and differentiated instruc
tional strategies to meet the needs of all students. Staff members can choose 
which professional development activities they would participate in on those district allotted days, ranging from technology 
in the classroom to in
-
depth 
English Language Arts ad
option training. With the technology supplied to the classrooms, much of the training at Dwyer is on using the technology and
 
setting up classrooms for 21st century learning.  Also this year, we will have two articulation days with the entire staff fr
om Hu
ntington Beach High School 
where our students matriculate to for high school.  Our staff and the high school staff meet by department to discuss how to 
transition the students for 
success to high school.
 
 
On
-
going examination and modification of practice i
s essential to professional growth. The primary purpose of professional development is to directly 
improve teaching and learning for all children. A portion of Dwyer Middle School's categorical program budget is allocated in
 
the School Plan for Student 
Ach
ievement (SPSA) for professional development activities to support improved instruction. Focus areas for staff development in
clude: technology in 
the classroom, writing for students below grade
-
level with Units of Study, reading in every subject area, and 
using a variety of instructional strategies to 
meet all learning styles. Staff members attend teaching seminars and other events designed to enhance their teaching techniqu
es and expand their 
knowledge base. Teachers new to the profession are supported by 
peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in
-
services offered by the West Orange 
County Consortium for Special Education or education consultants. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject
-
specific seminars and major conferences 
and share what they learn 
with other staff members. The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional support and 
opportunities to new teachers. The program is designed to assist those new to teaching to expand and deepen their teaching sk
ills, help the 
school 
district retain more new teachers, and improve learning opportunities for students. Classified staff and instructional assist
ants are provided training and 
development opportunities at the school, district and county levels. In
-
services for classifi
ed staff are geared to their specialty areas.
 
 
Staff members on campus collaborate in Professional Learning Communities (PLC) at the site and district level. At the site le
vel, there are departmental, 
whole staff and leadership level opportunities for teac
hers to design, implement and evaluate best practices and data that drives instruction. Course 
offerings are determined by student need and offered by highly qualified and credentialed teachers. Administration observes a
nd evaluates the 
curriculum and inst
ruction of each teacher in the classroom. All staff members work together to improve the learning of all students at Dwyer Mi
ddle 
School.

Types of Services Funded
 
Dwyer Middle School staff see themselves as an essential part of the support system for students. Our teachers, classified st
aff, assistant principals, and 
the 
principal join with the school psychologist, nurse, speech and language specialist, and resource specialist to ensure the wel
l
-
being of students. Dwyer 
currently has one counselor, one school psychologist that provide individual and group short
-
term counse
ling. Student guidance is provided by the 
assistant principals. The district nurse is scheduled at Dwyer Middle School for two half days each month. The nurse and heal
th clerk are responsible for 
student care, health counseling, and record keeping. A consu
lt agency conducts vision and hearing testing annually. The Student Study Team (SST) meets 
regularly to discuss referred students. Strategies are discussed and plans are implemented to assist students to achieve succ
ess at school.
 
 
The district's special e
ducation program addresses the needs of students with special needs through appropriate assessment, identification of problem
 
areas, placement, program implementation, evaluation, and review. Huntington Beach City School District participates in the W
est O
range County 
Consortium for Special Education (WOCCSE), which also serves Fountain Valley, Ocean View, Westminster, and Huntington Beach U
nion High school 
districts. The consortium allows participating districts to pool special education resources and expe
rtise. Dwyer Middle School offers both Specialized 
Academic Instruction and Targeted intervention supports in a collaborative model; students receive instruction in the general
 
education classroom with 
assistance from Special Education teachers and instruc
tional aides; Targeted interventions are also provided within the special education setting taught 
by a qualified special education teacher.
 
 
Dwyer services are funded in a multitude of ways. We receive community donations, general fund, and Title I fundin
g. Students are identified and 
scheduled into interventions that are funded through Title I federal monies. Dwyer's students below grade level or at
-
risk of retention have extra funds 
in many areas.  All students who struggle with homework completion are g
iven the opportunity to seek extra help and are assigned Extended Learning 
Academy if they have failed to complete a homework assignment in the classroom within the past two weeks. Dwyer sets aside 10
% of Title I funding to 
address the needs of it's subgro
ups by providing professional development to staff and teachers. Professional development programs include 
supplemental writing program training for collaborative core classes, additional math training so our math teachers can provi
de intervention math 
sup
port to struggling students, technology training, and writing training. Part of the Title I budget has also been earmarked fo
r after
-
school enrichment 
activities to encourage engagement of struggling students.
