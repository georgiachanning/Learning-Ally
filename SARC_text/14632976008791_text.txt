School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We believe a balanced education provides an opportunity for students to be self
-
sufficient, active, productive, and 
responsible members of society. The Owens Valley Unified School District is
 
committed to providing students the tools to 
explore their potential, to take responsibility for their own learning, and to recognize that learning is a lifelong process.
 
We shall provide a stimulating, secure, and imaginative environment that will foster
 
learning, self
-
esteem, and 
independence.
 
 
Owens Valley Unified School District is located in the town of Independence, California and covers approximately 792 
square miles of Inyo County. Independence is the county seat of Inyo County, a vast and rural co
unty with an average of 
1.8 persons per square mile. Independence is located in the Owens Valley below the majestic Sierra Nevada to the west 
and the Inyo Mountains to the East. It is connected to Southern California, to the south, and to Bishop, Mammoth L
akes, 
and Reno to the north by U.S. Highway 395. The economic base of the community is formed by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, Inyo County Administrative and Criminal Justice offices, California Department of Fish 
and Game, California High
way Department, National Park Service, Ranches and small businesses that provide services to 
residents and tourists. The average incomes of Independence families tend to be modest.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Although the school is well maintained there is a great need for infrastructure repairs due to aging facilities. The District
 
is exploring the feasibility of pursuing a Bond measure i
n November 2020. Additional funds will make possible necessary 
repairs and facility upgrades to allow our students the opportunity to learn in modernized classrooms and to have access 
to updated facilities in the gym, multipurpose room, and outside recreat
ional areas.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

the development of our LCAP and School Safety Plan as well as provide input on parent surveys to assist the District in 
improving programs and services for students.
 
 
There are various programs
 
throughout the school year scheduled in the evening hours that parents are encouraged to

there are limited funds received 
from State and Federal sources for these programs and no support from LCFF since we are a Basic Aid District.
