By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Hawthorne Elementary School community serves 756 students from preschool through sixth grade with a staff of 71 
certificated and classified.  We are committed to working collaboratively to provide an engaging, 
rigorous instructional 
program that enables all students to reach their full potential as individuals 
--
 
ready for college or career. The Hawthorne 
Team is dedicated to working with all stakeholders to build a solid foundation for students in all areas of 
the curriculum, 
including the visual and performing arts, Personalized Learning and AVID. Digital literacy and citizenship are taught at all 
grade levels, and innovation in the use of technology for teaching and learning is actively encouraged. Student voi
ce and 
choice are key components of the educational experience at Hawthorne. Success is measured by student performance on 
state assessments, district benchmarks, performance
-
based assessments, student work products, and surveys of students, 
parents, and s
taff. For Academic English Learners, success is also measured by performance on measures of English 
language development.
 
 
Our school mission statement is:
 
Hawthorne, a creative, responsible, inclusive community.
 
We are Personalized Learning.
 
We are AVID.
 
We are Better Everyday.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All parents are encouraged to take an active role in their child's education. This includes supporting students with daily 
homework and maintainin
g open lines of communication with their child's teacher and site administrators. Parents attend 
Back to School Night to learn about the requirements for the grade level their child is entering and to meet their child's 
teacher. Monthly meetings are held f
or parents of preschoolers to discuss topics of interest and to provide parents with 
opportunities to ask questions about the program. Open House is held in the spring; all families are invited to visit 
classrooms, talk with teachers, and view students' wo
rk on display. Throughout each year, parents are invited and 
encouraged to volunteer in their child's classroom.  Parents are welcomed to the monthly "Coffee with the Principals" and 
have the opportunity to gather and discuss issues and opportunities at Ha
wthorne.   Parents are also welcome to volunteer 
to work with students  in grade
-
level common areas (pods) or other parts of the campus.  A large number of parents 
support the weekly 100
-
Mile Club events as well as other special programs at Hawthorne. The 
participation of parents 
and guardians in field trips is welcomed. Evening events for parents and families, such as the Fall Festival, Family Math 
Nights, Parent/Child events or Family Day Tea, are offered school
-
wide, or by grade levels and individual tea
chers.
 
 
 
Parents are informed of and invited to join School Site Council (SSC), the English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC), the 
State Preschool Parent Committee, and the Hawthorne Parent/Teacher Association (PTA). Babysitting is provided  to make

recognized for academic and social achievements. PTA also hosts an ice cream party for Honor Roll students every 
trimester.
 
 
Parents participate in the development of special programs, such as Pe
rsonalized Learning, which provides students with 
an opportunity to pursue areas of interest, learn at their own pace, and use technology to enhance their learning. Through 
groups such as School Site Council and PTA, parents share ideas and work together w
ith staff to set priorities for learning, 
identify ways to support students and parents, and work with staff on common goals such as improving student 
attendance.

As a school, we continue to focus on building team and individual expertise to implement a rigorous, engaging instructional 
program that moves students toward mastery of Com
mon Core State Standards, ensures a minimum of 85% of students 
are reading at grade level by the end of third grade 
--
 
and that reduces the gap for English Learners by 10% when compared 
with last year's results. Interventions for  students not at grade lev
el focus on identifying student needs and targeting 
small
-
group instruction. Student achievement data, parent input, teacher and staff surveys, and observations of district 
and outside experts guide the staff in making decisions for personal development, t
raining, and goals for student 
achievement.
 
We will also focus on building equity for all of our students and to this end a group of teachers and administrators attended
 
the Excellence through Equity Conference in September of 2018 and 2019.  During this c
onference the staff attended 
keynote and breakout sessions focused on academic and social emotional equity for all students.
 
Team and individual teacher expertise was developed year
-
round with regard to all assessments 
--
 
both state, district, 
site, and te
acher
-
generated. All schools are using both reading and math universal screening tools.
 
Teachers participated in the training related to the adoption of Eureka Math and during the 2019/20 school year TK
-
2 will 
particpate in training for the new wonders mat
erial.  Special Education teachers were included in all sessions that applied 
to them, and also attended both on
-
 
and off
-
site training geared toward their needs.
 
The Leadership Team met before the year started to look at data and make preliminary plans fo
r the year. Leadership 
Team members also participated in Strengths
-
Based Leadership training, which continued throughout the year.
 
Professional development was offered via site
-
based training and district
-
offered PD sessions. Teams invited district 
specialists into their collaboration meetings for additional, specific, and ongoing support. Specific training, identified by
 
teachers as a priority, was also provided for teaching at high levels of Depth of Knowledge, use of Universal Design for 
Learning/
MTSS to enhance initial instruction and intervention.
 
Teachers also participate in the Shared Leadership Team and are provided support and professional development with 
Innovate Ed.  This process includes goal setting and instructional rounds throughout th
e year.
 
Professional development will continue to include district and site training on Common Core State Standards, instructional 
and intervention strategies, Personalized Learning with integration of technology, equity and digital citizenship. District, 
site, and outside consultants will support expansion of our innovative Personalized Learning program, which has grown to 
be a school wide initiative, covering all grade  levels.  Hawthorne teachers in grades K 
-
 
2 will continue to focus on literacy 
and num
eracy, and will use K
-
2 Institute strategies with struggling students. This training includes  a scope and sequence 
of phonemic awareness and phonics, along with proven instructional strategies that tap all learning modalities. 
Professional development is 
offered during and after the school day at both site and district locations. Conference 
attendance, coaching, observations guided by teachers, and meetings with site administrators are offered as choices as 
well. Team leaders will continue to participate w
ith site administrators in a series of Shared Leadership opportunities.
 
New teachers participate in the Professional Growth Systems, which matches new teachers with a partner teacher and 
also provides training at both the site and district levels. This tra
ining focuses on the Danielson Model for teacher 
development.
