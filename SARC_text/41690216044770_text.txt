Principals' Message
 
Tierra Linda Middle School is located in San Carlos, a suburban community on the San Francisco 
Peninsula. Since Tierra Linda re
-
opened in 2000, the school serves students 6th thro
ugh 8th grade 
school with a school in transition which opened for fourth and fifth graders in 2019
-
2020. At each 
grade level, students are given more responsibility, choices of elective courses and independence. 
A rich multidisciplinary curriculum is insti
tuted school wide to meet the needs of all students. The 
academic program is creative yet rigorous, accessible to all students and is aligned with the 
California State Standards.
 
 
A new school was completed on the campus for Charter Learning Center in Sept
ember 2018.  The 
campus continues to house the San Carlos Charter Learning Center, a K
-
8 independent charter 
school as well as Mariposa, fully operational for 2019
-
20. We currently have 500 students in Tierra 
Linda Middle School. The 314 4th and 5th grade 
Mariposa students are housed on the Tierra Linda 
campus, and participate in the PE and elective programs such as band, orchestra and art. The 
sharing of the facilities continues to be smooth this year, and we are enjoying the changes to our 
school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019

At Tierra Linda Middle School, parental involvement is an integral part of our program. Our active Parent Teacher Association
 
organizes volunteer 
committees to take on leadership roles such as planning TL Orientation Day, School Tours, Sch
ool Community events, and planning promotion for our 
8th graders each year. Parents support our many school programs through tutoring and mentoring students, and working closely 
with the counselor and 
teachers on various school and community projects. The 
School Site Council parent members are elected by the parent community to serve on the council 
for a two year term.  Parents run a number of campus clubs including the Math Team. Parents always are invited and encouraged
 
to share their input 
and suggestion
s.  Additionally, we have parent volunteers sign up to support students in English classes with "book bingo" and drive on fie
ld trips.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
