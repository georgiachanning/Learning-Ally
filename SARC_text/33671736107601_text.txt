School Description
 
Landau Elementary School is located in Cathedral City, a community adjacent to Palm Springs. As 
one of sixteen elementary schools in the Palm Springs Unified School District, Landau serves 
approximately 760 students in grades preschool through five, in reg

The School Plan for Student Achievement is updated annually by the Landau School Site Council. 
Our school will evaluate the effectiveness of our School Plan shortly after SBAC Test scores are 
released, and our School Site Council and other 
leadership groups have had the opportunity to 
review and analyze all student achievement data. Monitoring comments will be added to our 
School Plan throughout the year. Revisions to our School Plan, and subsequent Board approval, will 
occur if there are su
bstantial budget and/or material changes during the school year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Landau Elementary School has excellent facilities, including classrooms, other buildings, and play spaces. There are 40 class
rooms, of which 12 are 
portable classrooms. There are classrooms dedicated to music and P.E instruction.  There are also classrooms
 
for resources and small or whole
-
class 
instruction, technology, and after school use. The library is large and has space for students to work at tables or sit on th
e carpet. The Multipurpose Room 
is utilized for breakfasts and lunches,  during inclement w
eather, for assemblies and programs, as well as for the after
-
school program sponsored by 
YMCA. There are four smaller rooms which house Special Education pull
-
out services, the school psychologist and/or counselor, and are used for small 
group assessment 
or intervention groups.
 
 
The playing fields include a regulation soccer field, smaller soccer field, two diamonds, four basketball courts, volleyball 
court, six handball walls, blacktop 
area for ball games or relay races, and a sand area with three climber
s and two swing sets. Three shade structures provide sun relief, and tables are 
provided under the largest shade structure. Tables for meals are also situated under overhangs and a shade structure near the
 
Multipurpose Room. The 
preschool and Kindergarten 
playground includes a shade structure, swings, basketball, and a climbing structure, with grassy and hard cape areas, as well
 
as a route for riding equipment. Tables and benches are also situated on the playground. Two gates and a fence provide securi
ty.
 
 
The school was opened in 1988. Regular maintenance and special projects have kept Landau in excellent overall condition. Work
 
orders are entered using 
the district's set system, and prompt attention is given to requests, with special attention to safety is
sues.
 
 
All areas have wireless access as of 2007, the school's exterior was painted in 2017, and all inside cafeteria tables were re
placed. A full
-

the front drop off area as students arrive to school. Students are welcomed to the playground 30 minutes before school be
gins, and supervisors monitor 
the entrance gates and then the playground. During school all entrance is through the school office where appropriate measure
s are taken to ensure 
that anyone requesting access to a classroom or a student has the proper identi
fication and/or justification for the request. After school teachers and 
the administrator are stationed at doors and near the parking lot, and the crossing guard also provides crossing. Approximate

Provide adequate supervision for students during the morning and lunch to ensu
re student safety.
 

 
Provide students with additional academic and social
-
emotional support by funding a Behavior Paraprofessional. This person works works 
within the guidelines of our social
-
emotional curriculum (Second Step) by provide in individual and gr

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussion
s with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instru
ction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years, as well as an addition of 
training around Claim 2 (Writing). The professional development in these areas was 
provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the teachers also began working with High Impact Math consultants. This professional development 
centers around building stud

-
19) the 
focus was on developing strategies to support number sense by implementing mental math routines and highlighting the landscap
e of lear
ning in 
mathematics. During Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strengthening mental math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and 
implementing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This professional development also s
upports teachers with the implementation of the 
district
-
adopted math program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 12 full days of ELA training in 2017
-
18, 6 full days in 2018
-
19 and 4 full days in 2019
-
20. T
he remaining days in 
2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 are full days of professional learning for math.
