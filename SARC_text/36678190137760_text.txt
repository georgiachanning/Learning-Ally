Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to Lincoln Elementary School, a pre
-
K to 6th grade school dedicated to providing educational excellence to both 

academic needs wi
thin a safe and collaborative environment so that all are able to reach their full potential. We believe 
that all students must be given opportunities to express themselves in their own unique way. To this end, teachers strive 
to create academic rich lesso
n that incorporate the most up to date research based practices that allow for students to 
express their learning through many avenues. The Lincoln teachers also conduct regular and ongoing assessments to 
identify student academic gaps that are impeding in
dividual student learning. Through ongoing analysis of this data, 
effective interventions are implemented to remedy these learning gaps before they escalate and effect future learning. 
With these approaches to instruction and intervention, we are preparing
 
our students to be college and career ready.
 
 
We believe that all students have the right to fully participate in all school related functions and events. Therefore, we 
embrace inclusion opportunities wherever possible for our Special Education students a
nd commit to working to find ways 
to deepen this integration school
-
wide. The use of technology is also a huge focus at Lincoln in order to prepare our 
students for the careers and the world they will shape in the future. Every first thru sixth grade stude
nt has a computer 
assigned exclusive to them and our kinder classes have a computer cart that they share. Special communication software 
tools are provided to our Special Education students to enrich their academic experience.
 
 
We hope you will partner wit
h us as your child travels through their educational journey. We have several opportunities 

y 
Nights, Awards Assemblies, and Parent
 
Conferences are only some of the events we host throughout the year. Please keep 

Lincoln Elementary School is a great place to lear
n and grow!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Jessica Perry, Principal
 
 
Our mission at Lincoln Elementary School, a highly diverse, dynamic and uniquely integrated educational community, is 
to ensure all students a quality education through a commitment to excellence.
 
 
Lincoln 
Elementary School, a unique innovative learning environment, serves both general education classes and special 
education classes from preschool through grade six. Presently, both general and special education students participate in 
an integrated schedule,
 
where all students interact during breakfast, recess, lunch, assemblies, intervention and 

general education students to build understand
ing, caring and nurturing relationships with our special education students. 
Simultaneously, it creates opportunities for our special education students to develop positive relationships with their 
same
-
aged general education peers.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the 
requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
