School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ocean Shore School provides instruction in a nurturing environment for experiential learning through a combination of 
whole class, small group, and individualized instruction. Students are actively engaged as creative prob
lem
-
solvers and 
critical thinkers. Parents, staff, and community members collaborate to develop educational programs and provide 
instruction. Parents assist throughout the school and coordinate special projects such as thematic projects, supporting 
classes
 
in the library, computer lab, and after school enrichment activities. Fostering strong family partnerships is a key 
component of how we support our students.  Families are involved with our students by supporting their child at home, 
serving as chaperones
 
on regular field trips for all grades, volunteering in various roles through various organizations like 
our Parent Teacher Organization, Pacifica Education Foundation and various school or district committees. A strong 
community is developed at Ocean Shor
e School for students, families, and staff. Our students have leadership 
opportunities and use restorative practices to address conflicts. We are committed to creating a positive climate for our 
diverse community.
 
 
The combination of all of these elements 
allows all of our students to achieve at a high academic level in an engaging, 
enriching and supportive environment that exists both inside and outside of the classroom.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
An Ocean Shore team consisting of administrators, teachers, staff and parents came together for a two day Parent 
Engagement Learning Institute designed to build the capacity of the school team to develop, implemen
t and evaluate 
family engagement practices that lead to increased academic outcomes. At the Institute the team learn to align family 
engagement practices with School Plan for Student Achievement and LCAP goals and priorities and to develop, implement 
and e
valuate family engagement practices as professional learning community. The team meet for follow
-
up meetings to 
execute the plan, evaluate their practices and develop additional actions.
 
 
The opportunities for parent involvement at Ocean Shore are unique a
nd outstanding. Our parents and teachers have 
built a nurturing community for students.  Parent leadership on the School Site Council and the PTO has resulted in the 
implementation of many support programs at our school, including PE, gardens, music, scien
ce labs, art, and intervention 
support for Math and English Language Arts. Our parents take on many committee and project leadership roles, and they 
work alongside our teachers in implementing a project
-
based learning environment. For more information on h
ow to 
become involved, contact Michelle Tuman at osspresident@yahoo.com.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Ocean Shore emphasizes the value of and the respect for our facility, our community, and ourselves.  During the spring of 
2019, a team of teachers, staff and parent volunteers attended additional training at the San Mateo County Office of 
Educat
ion on student reunification and evacuation safety protocols.  This team of staff and parents met monthly to review 
site safety plans and prepare for safety drills.  Drills included all of the Big 5 Safety protocols and were conducted monthl
y.  
In the fall
 
of 2019, staff training was conducted around the Big 5 Safety Protocols, with particular emphasis on new drills 
related to student reunification plans.  We have a well
-
developed programs that train students in respectful and accepting 
behaviors. Parents w
ere encouraged to attend the Parent University sessions which informed parents about safety 
procedures and best practices for working in the classroom as a volunteer.
 
 
We maintain emergency supplies on site, including food and water. The school grounds are
 
secured during the day. All 
visitors must enter through the front door and sign in at the office. The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with the school faculty and School Site Council in December 2019.
