Marina Vista Elementary Arts Academy nurtures creative thinkers and innovative scholars through 
the arts to reach their whole potential. We value the partnerships between parents, 
staff, students, 
and our community. Each group has a role with the common focus: All students will be successful 
learners. It is through Language Arts, English Language Development,  math, science, social studies 
and The Arts.  We know that children develo
p important character traits such as courage, 
confidence, and creativity when we focus on the whole child. These traits contribute to student 
academic success in all subject areas.
 
 
This is Marina Vista Elementary Arts Academy second year with  the Kennedy
 
Center for the 
Performing Arts program as a Turnaround Arts School. Turnaround Arts brings arts education 
resources into priority schools as a strategic tool for targeting larger school challenges and 
opportunities. As a school of the arts, we empower stu
dents to cultivate a passion for learning 
through the arts. The school is dedicated to ensuring equitable access to the arts through daily 
classroom arts integration into the core curriculum, as well as a positive behavior approach 
centered on mindfulness.
 
We are a school community that encourages the arts as an avenue to 
promoting expression, identity, and culture for our student artists.
 
 
Our staff is committed to inspiring all students and staff to be lifelong learners. All teachers are 
leaders at our sc
hool and are on cohort teams, which consist with ELA, ELD, Math, Science and PBIS.  
Our staff become experts in their desired area and deliver all Professional Developments to the 
staff.  The staff is committed to all students and any student that needs he
lp in understanding 
specific academic subject, is assisted in Response to Intervention (RTI) and small group instruction. 
These models provide opportunities for each child to receive instruction at their personal level. 
Through these models and our creativ
e scheduling, teachers give a more focused approach to meet 

to improve student achievement in language arts and math. We also have English Language 
Developme

skills.
 
 
Marina Vista Elementary Arts Academy puts  grade level Common Core  Standards inunison with 
The Arts first. We support the research that comes from the United S
tates Department of Education 
and the California Department of Education. We believe, like our associate institutions, in focusing 
on teaching children all grade level standards and skills they need to succeed at work, home, and 
in the community. We applau
d those that have given their time in support of our students, and 
welcome you to join us. When people work together not only do our children prosper, but so does 
humanity.

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on 
August 2019, and determined that the school had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, incl
uding English learners, are given 
their own individual 
standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recomme
nded materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of the California Common 
Core standards

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvem
ent to our local schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965, more than 50 years ago, and 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a
 
$213 million school facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional detai
ls.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an onlin
e supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The im
portant purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything need
s 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
thi
s assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

School Safety Plan
 
The safety and well 
being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District and this school. Under Sen
ate Bill 
187, every school in the district is required to complete (or review and update) a School Safety Plan by March 1 of each y
ear. The plan is reviewed and 
evaluated by the School Safety Planning Committee, the School Site Council, and the school principal before being presented t
o the Board of Education 
for final review and adoption. The approved plans are posted on each school'
s website, as well as the district website at www.mpusd.net.
 
 
Highlight's of this school's plan are detailed below.
 
 
Student/Parent Handbooks are available in our office and online at mpusd.k12.ca.us, giving information on the school and safe
ty rules. Staf
f members 
monitor our playground and campus before school, after school, and during recess. Our positive reinforcement  and discipline 
policies curtail fighting 
and harassment. We routinely go over playground safety rules with students, and we practice fir
e  drills monthly and conduct ALiCE and earthquake drills 
twice a year. We update our Safety Plan at the beginning of each year and this year will be revising the plan to reflect the 
District Safety Plan.
 
 
Our school practices fire drills monthly.  We also
 
participate in The Great Shakeout each October, which is an earthquake drill.  We conduct two 
earthquake drills yearly.  We practice Intruder drills two times a year, focused on safety first.
 
 
PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) team mee

environment for our staff and students.
 
 
Parents have been informed about how to respond to school emergencies. Our staff and students practice emergency drills and 
evacuation every month.  
Our staff is trained in various crisis and emergency management process and procedures.
 
 
We also have a Crisis Management Plan in place for every staff in case of an emergency.
 
 
Each year, the school along with the School Site 
Council reviews and adopts a Comprehensive School Safety Plan. This plan details specifics on how the 
school, staff and students will respond during any emergency.
 
 
We participate in Safe Routes to School, which teaches our parents and students how to come
 
to school safely everyday.
