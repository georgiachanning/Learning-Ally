Principal's Message
 
I
 
would like to welcome you to Mountain View Elementary School's Annual School Accountability 
Report Card. In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an 
annual School Accountability Report Card that fulfills state and federal disclosure requirements. 
Parents will find valuable information about our academic achievement, professional staff, 
curricular programs, instructional materials, safety procedures, cl
assroom environment, and 
condition of facilities.
 
 
Mission Statement:  Mountain View believes all learners can REACH individual success through 
critical thinking and collaboration.
 
 
Vision Statement:  Mountain View's diverse community members are all value
d and supported in 
a collaborative environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, A
vailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Mountain View Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California St
ate Standards. Instructional 
materials are selected from
 
the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's adoption cycle for core content materials (English language arts, math, science, and social sc
ience)
.
 
 
On Thursday, October 17, 2019, the Claremont Unified School District's Board of Education held a public hearing to certify th
e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolutio
n #06
-
2020 which certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students,including English learners, in the d
istrict to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials
, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content o
f 
the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their 
visual/performing 
arts curricula. During the 2018
-
19 school year, Claremont Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and
 
to take home. These materials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and 
functional through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervision. 
Mountain View Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1962; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure 
facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate space fo
r students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate 
non
-
routin
e maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need attent
ion prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds.
 
One full
-
time day custodian and two evening custodians (one full
-
time and one part
-
time) are assigned to Mountain View 
Elementary School. The day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Cafeteria setup/cleanup
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 

 
Trash removal
 
 
 
Restrooms are checked
 
throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and s
chool safety issues.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
