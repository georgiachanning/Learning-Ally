About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publ
ish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare
 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent
 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information ab
out the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principa
l or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Parent involvement is an integral part of any school community. We encourage parents to volunteer in the classrooms at our sc
hool as much as they 
desire as long as they have a current TB test and fingerprints with the district. We also hav
e opportunities for parents to participate in our Parent Teacher 
Organization (PTO). Our PTO provides support to our classroom and school and provides activities for the family to bring our 
school community closer 
together. Parents also are welcome to part
icipate and attend our School Site Council Meetings. These meetings include discussions about school 
programs, school budgets, and seeks input from the site council members on how to best utilize school funds to help students 
maximize achievement, 
while me
eting the needs of our community . Additionally parents of English Learners are welcome to attend our ELAC (English language 
Advisory Council) 
meetings. During these meetings we discuss the needs of students who are English Learners, programs to support th
em, and ways we can better inform 
parents of the educational process for their children.  We offer a parent liaison, parent resource room, and a Latino Literac
y program to help build parent 
involvement and literacy support for parents and students.  Last w
e have a parent involvement team that is actively working at increasing parent 
involvement.  This has included parent picnic days on campus and parent empowerment nights in which teachers teach parents ab
out academic programs 
and ways to support student le
arning.  We also offer English classes in the evenings for parents.  You can find out more about opportunities to participate

School Safety Plan
 
Creekside Oaks is a school where students can excel academically and can find a safe and comforta
ble place to learn. Students focus on being safe, 
respectful, responsible, and unified. They are expected to demonstrate these characteristics in all their interactions throug
hout each school day. Students 
develop these characteristics by the way they trea
t themselves and each other. Teachers demonstrate these characteristics by the way they treat students 
and how they interact with parents and other staff members. Teachers utilize "Love and Logic" strategies to create a positive
 
learning environment and 
pr
omote student responsibility of their own behavior.  Creekside Oaks is a school community that prides itself on working toget
her and collaborating to 
help students have a positive learning experience.  Creekside Oaks is a PBIS school and uses positive inte
rventions and the bucket filling philosophy to 
discourage negative behavior and create a positive learning environment.
 
 
Creekside Oaks has a school safety plan that outlines how to assure that students will be safe and comfortable while on campu
s. It also
 
includes 
procedures to keep students safe during emergency situations. The plan is updated and revised every year through our School S
ite Council to 
accommodate any improvements that need to be made.  The schools safety plan is based on the practices of t
he standard response protocol (SRP) 
through the "I luv u guys" foundation iloveuguys.org.  We have a school safety team that analyzes and makes recommendations t
o create a safe school 
environment.  We are currently working with Lincoln Police to streamline
 
safety procedures and maximize the safety of the campus.  Last we are 
developing our school plans for reunification through the SRM.

The district sponsors many opportunities for professional development credit, both during the school day and after hours for 
Staff Development Buyback 
and/or local units of credit. Creekside Oaks staff has recently participated in various forms of staff de
velopment. Behavior training in the Love and Logic 
program gives staff members strategies to work with students to take responsibility for their actions and accept appropriate 
consequences. It also helps 
build positive relationships between staff and stude
nts. Teachers have additionally attended professional development in teaching to the ELA common 
core standards through the Placer County Office of Education, developing writing skills, teaching academic vocabulary, utiliz
ing engagement and checking 
for und
erstanding strategies to improve instruction, and utilizing the ELD standards in our English Learner instruction.  This inclu
des ELD integrated and 
designated training's from the district. Teachers have been trained in GLAD strategies.  Science teachers ha
ve been trained for the Next Generation 
Science Standards.  The district has also provided training for youth development institute (YDI), which helps build relation
ships and the leadership 
capacity of our youth.  All teachers are being trained in TESS (To
tal Education System Supports) to support math instruction.  Teachers are also being 
trained in AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination), iReady diagnostic program (online instruction at each students ac
ademic level), teaching 
technology in the clas
sroom.  Last we have started TLC (Teacher Learning Centers) in which teachers work on lesson design and team teach lessons to
 
students.
