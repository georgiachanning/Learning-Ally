About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is
 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies 
(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 
in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/s
a/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shou
ld contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have
 
books in core classes for all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far mor
e meaningful when along with 
the more detailed description of textbooks conta

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
San Joaquin Elementary School was dedicated in August 1999. The condition of the build
ings at San Joaquin Elementary School is good.
 
 
Each school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. The number of classrooms at e
ach school site varies, 
depending on enrollment and available space. Several sites 
have portable class rooms to accommodate increased enrollment and to meet the guidelines 
for Class Size Reduction (CSR).
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensur
e that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. Administrators work daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a safe as well as immacula
te campus.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts t
o ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrumen
t 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the 
standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who p
articipated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who re
ceived scores.
