About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (
SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t

pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (Scho
ol Year 2019
-
20)
 
Student achievement and success are based upon a strong community partnership. TownGate Elementary School encourages parental
 
community 
involvement and provides a wide variety of activities that allow for it.
 
 
Parents enrich and enhance ou
r instructional program through membership in the Parent 
-
Teachers' Organization (PTO) and the hundreds of volunteer 
hours in the classrooms they provide. Our PTO supports and promotes Spirit Days, Red Ribbon week, teacher/ class support, ass
emblies, field
 
trips, 
dances, school wide incentives and rewards, and fifth grade promotion activities. Meeting agendas posted in the school office
 
at least 72 hours prior to 
LCAP meetings.
 
Parents are encouraged to attend Back To School Night, Special event performance
s, Parent/Teacher Conferences, Open House, Harvest Carnival and 
Family Math/STEAM Night and AVID Literacy Night.
 
 
Our Local Control Accountability Plan Support Group (LCAP) has been organized with parents and staff members from our parent 
groups, union 
rep
resentatives, staff and categorical facilitators. They meet regularly to identify TownGate's needs and allocate funds and ali
gn resources to promote 
and ensure student success. There are eight focus LCAP areas identified as state priorities and the school 
budgets reflected in the school plan support 
these goals.
 
 
Our School Site Council (SSC), comprised of the School Leadership Team and parent representatives, works collaboratively with
 
the entire TownGate staff 
in determining the best way to utilize catego
rical funds to provide additional support to our core instructional programs. The TownGate SSC meets 
monthly, and the meetings are open to the public. Meeting agendas are posted in the school office at least 72 hours prior to 
all SSC meetings.

conducted in English and Spanish and address topics such as homework strategies for English Learners, bullying, sexual harass
ment, and active parenting.
 
 
Community involvement includes support from area businesses and civic organ

Gluck program provides arts outreach to our students during and after school. Friday Night Live Kids organization provides ac
tivities to encourage/support 
students to be drug free and ac

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Pla
n
 
Towngate has committed to a successful and proactive approach to creating and maintaining a safe learning environment. With P
ositive Behavior 
Intervention Support (PBIS) and strategies, students and teachers are provided with explicit information as what
 
is required and needed to maintain a 
high level of school safety. The school safety plan is created to communicate to all staff the required laws and procedures r
elated to school safety. It was 
last reviewed and updated in March of 2019, and discussed wit
h school staff in August, 2019. We will review the plan again in March of 2020.
 
 
Fire drills are held at least once a month at the elementary schools. Disaster, earthquake, and lock
-
down drills are conducted as needed. The School 
Safety Plan also includes 
the MVUSD elementary sequential discipline standard plan, which describes the consequences for student misconduct (such as 
detention, Saturday School, suspension, and expulsion). The PBIS Team reviews disciplinary data at Tier 1, 2 & 3 Levels on a 
monthly 
basis. From the 
gathered data, intervention plans for support are discussed and implemented.
