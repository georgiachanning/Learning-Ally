By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Students are supervised by
 
staff while on the playground during school
-
sponsored recesses or other assigned outdoor 
activities. One Campus Safety Assistant (CSA)  greets the students and takes them to the playground before school where 
two teachers supervise students from 8:00 A.M.
 
to 8:10 A.M. when they are picked up by their teachers. At the end of the 
school day students are walked to the front of the school where the principal, vice
-
principal, and/or CSA supervises the 
dismissal. A designated teacher supervises and supports stud
ents waiting for the school bus. Our school has guidelines for 
dealing with earthquakes, fires, and other emergency situations.

The facility is clean and well maintained. The school library, which is a newer building, and computer lab are used during 
school hours to their maximum capacity. Each classroom has an interactive television, an Elmo projector, and a laptop 
computer to support student learning and use of media.
 
 
Colonial Acres School always receives compliments on how well the school is mainta


care of any emergency health and safety issues.
 
 
Colonial Acres Elementary School has been alloca
ted 75 hours of custodial time per week and the services of a District 
maintenance crew to ensure that the school and grounds are clean and well maintained. The day custodian works from 
6:45 A.M. until 2:45 P.M. The night custodian works from 2:15 P.M. unt
il 9:45 P.M. Both cover school sponsored and 
community events when necessary, for additional pay.
 
 
The original building was completed in 1949 with additional wings built by 1960. Two portables were added in 1990. All 
portables are in fair to poor conditio
n. Two had new floors installed in the summer of 2005. A five classroom wing with 
student restroom, staff restroom, and custodial closet was built and opened in August 2018, financed by a bond measure. 
All other classrooms are in good condition.
 
 
All rooms
 
are wired for Internet and the entire facility has been made handicap accessible. There is a lift for the stage and 
designated restrooms are handicap accessible. We have one classroom converted to a library and another converted to a 
computer lab. There a
re at least 30 computers in the lab. Kinder 
-
 
2nd classrooms share a class set of Chromebook between 
paired classes and 3rd 
-
 
5th grade have 1:1 devices. We have extensive outdoor fields that are used by community groups, 
too. Our multipurpose room, limite
d to 250 people, is used for lunch, PE, assemblies, community groups, and PTA 
activities. We have 13,492 books in our library which means 23 books per student.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Colonial Acres has a 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed and revised annually. The names on the 
emergency flow chart change year to year to reflect the changes in staffing. The School Climate and Safety Committee 
meets monthly to monitor and enhance the school 
climate, safety drills, and procedures. Data is collected and reviewed 
from discipline, suspensions, and parent surveys. Our Safety Plan was developed with input from both parents and staff.

Each year, the Alameda County Sheriffs Department and the Coloni
al Acres SSC/ELAC review and approve an updated 
version of the plan. Periodically throughout the year, we reinforce with the staff, both in training and in written form, eac
h 
of their responsibilities in the event of an emergency. All staff members have be
en provided a digital copy of the safety 
handbook that details their responsibilities as well as descriptions of each of these tasks. In the event of an emergency, al
l 
members have assigned responsibilities.
 
 
All visitors are required to sign in at the off
ice and obtain a visitor badge, which they must wear while on campus. Each 
classroom has an outside telephone line with voicemail. Select staff and administrators use district wide walkie
-
talkies to 
communicate across campus and with other district sites i
n case of an emergency. Classified and/or certificated employees 
supervise the activities of the students before school, during recess, lunch, and at dismissal. Colonial Acres Elementary 
School continuously reviews the School Safety Plan and conducts month
ly safety drills. The School Safety Plan was most 
recently reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty in September 2019.

Professional Development for New Teachers:
 
Through participation in the Teacher Induction Program (TIP), the District 
secures support providers to work with our new 
teachers. Through TIP Induction Program, new teachers are afforded the opportunity to take university level courses at a 
reduced tuition cost. This program offers training to new teachers for two years, as the
y sharpen their skills as educators. 
The induction portion of this program leads them to acquiring their clear credential through the Commission on Teacher 
Credentialing. Professional development by Applied Learning Systems is available to new teachers and
 
they can choose 
off site activities when focused on our student's needs.
