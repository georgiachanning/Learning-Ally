Select math and English language 
arts teachers, including Special Day Class and Resource Specialist Program teachers, attended 
a six day LUSD institute to develop standards based benchmarks for their respective grade level. Teachers also attended 
Summer Institutes to help support English 
Learners and other students with ELD/Formal Academic English focus in closing the 

modeling, and provides support to teachers based on d
ata as well as provide follow
-
up professional development based on 
data to grade levels/departments or staff on a weekly basis. This multi
-

needs and is based on student data. Additional trainings are pr
ovided by the site administrators.
 

 
Teachers have attended Summer Institutes to help support English Learners and other students in closing the achievement 
gap, particularly for students with disabilities and English Language Learners. At Abbott, we provide
 
45 minutes of strategic, 
daily intervention to support all students as Language Learners in the form of our Academic Language Development/English 
Language Development rotations. School administrators monitor implementation of the 50/50 instructional model
, where 
half of the period is spent in a heterogeneous whole group and half is in small homogeneous leveled groups for targeted 

 
 
Focus for Improvement
 

 
Abbott Elementary School
 
has made significant growth in English language arts and mathematics over the past three years. In 
order to foster continued growth, our collective focus must shift from a mindset of remediation to one of enrichment and 
depth.
 

 
Abbott will continue to deep
en its school
-
wide focus on the development of data, continue to align our curriculum with 
essential state and Common Core standards, design interim assessments to determine student progress, participate in 
scheduled reflective meetings to determine instru
ctional need and implement prescriptive intervention. Teachers will strictly 
adhere to our 50/50 instructional plan framed around teacher identified target standards. Center based instruction includes 
guided reading, which will address the variance in stud
ent reading levels. Thirty minutes of daily word study will be integrated 
into the schedule.
 

 
Additionally, Abbott instructional staff create team lesson plans and assessments. These assessments are comprised of target 
standards in both English language art
s and math. In order to prepare our Abbott Scholars for the technological demands of 
the Common Core and Smarter Balanced Assessment formats, these periodic assessments for third through sixth graders will 
be administered and scored online. Common Core is 
a set of standards developed by the federal government in the hopes of 
unifying education standards nationwide.
 

 
Abbott regularly participate in collaborative grade level planning sessions, to support the cultivation of differentiated str
ategies 
for individ
ual student needs. After school intervention and Saturday academies also further reinforce daily instruction and 
student mastery of key target standards.
 

 
Student progress is closely monitored using state, district benchmark, and site
-
based assessments. The

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. This online report
 
shows whether we 
had a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
During the 2004
-
2005 Abbott inaugurated a new facility that currently houses our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students. Our RSP/Speech programs and
 
Science 
Laboratory are also located in this building. This addition complemented the main campus buildings which h

plant is in need of some modernization and cosmetic repair.
 
 
Our custodial team helps maintain our campus grounds clean and safe. The grounds are consistently monitored to ensure cleanli
ness and student safety. 
The campus includes 31 permanent classrooms, 8 portables, a library, 2 computer labs, a science lab, a blacktop playground an
d grassy play areas. At the 
present time, 100% of our restrooms are in good working order. Lynwood Unified School District administ
ers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure 
that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained. When repairs are needed, a work order is submitted to District personnel, which immediately alerts 
them of any maintenance needed to be performed.
 
 
During
 
2011
-
2012, some cosmetic improvements were made to our facilities. These improvements included re
-
carpeting and painting. Our exterior fence 
was extended around our North side classrooms. Our phone system and technological/ communications capabilities wer
e also updated.
 
 
Planned 2012
-
2013 improvement include: new administrative offices, updated paint, window upgrades, ceiling panel replacement, additional f
encing, 
landscaping and refurbishing of our security cameras.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our 
school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating
 
and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to 
make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Comprehensive School Safet
y Plan include the following: child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaster
 
response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policy, suspension and expulsion p
olici

. District Safety Officials 

s to discuss district protocol and communicate safety recommendations. Practice 
emergency drills are held on a monthly basis to familiarize staff and students with emergency procedures. The School Site Cou
