About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful analysis of achievement data.  The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teac
hers also have opportunities to attend conferences 
and district
-
wide professional development throughout the year. Areas of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strate
gies for 
implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices fo
r Data Teams collaboration, curriculum training in language arts, English Language 
Development, Mathematics, and Social Emotional Learning, as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learner
s. Teachers of students 
with special needs and t
eachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. 
This 
professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade
-
level teams, and through individua
l mentoring by the school 
administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of the BTSA Induction Support program for first and second year 
teachers. Teachers who are 
experiencing difficultly or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assi
stance Review) Program.
 
 
Last year the National School District hired two Social Workers.  The Social Workers provided professional development for Ce
ntral School in the areas 
of Restorative Practices, and Social Emotional Learning.  In addition, the Natio
nal School District also hired one full
-
time counselor for each school.  All 
counselors have been provided professional development on the Sanford Harmony program, a curriculum focusing on the Social Em
otional learning of 
students.  This year classroom tea
chers have been participating in professional development on the UCI (University of California Irvine) Math framework.  
The UCI Math framework replaced the Rigorous Curriculum Design Math framework in the National School District.  The Mathemati
cs professi
onal 
development has been ongoing this school year. Teachers have had the opportunity to attend training during their non
-
school days as well as on the 
clock, and have been trained by consultants from the University of Irvine.  Last year the National Schoo
l District  hired three District Resource Teachers 
who have been providing additional professional development in Mathematics to teachers as well, in addition to other content 
areas. Most currently the 
National School District Resource Teachers have been p
roviding professional development in the area of English Language Arts and the English Language 
Development standards and demonstrating to teachers how these standards work in tandem with one another. The National School 
District Resource 
Teachers are also
 
available to provide coaching to classroom teachers and can offer modeled lessons in the classrooms.
 
 
The National School District has adopted the new English Language Arts program, Benchmark, as well as English Language Arts m
aterials from the 
publisher,
 
American Reading Company.  Additional professional development on the new adoption will continue through the remainder of the
 
school 
year.  Our Language Arts Specialists at the school sites along with the Resource (RSP) Teachers, will be receiving trainin
g on the new English Language 
Arts adoption in order to be able to provide additional professional development at their individual sites as well in order t
o assist staff with the 
implementation of the new materials.  In addition to the professional develop
ment that teachers have been receiving this school year, site administrators 
have also received professional development from the National School District Educational Services Department in the areas of
 
the UCI Mathematics 
framework, Restorative Practices,
 
Social Emotional Learning, and also professional development by American Reading Company.  In addition to 
certificated staff and administrators, our classified staff has also been receiving professional development this school year
.  Campus supervisors ha
ve 
received training in Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) as well as Restorative Practices.  In addition, our c
lassified staff was trained by site 
administrators in the area of sexual harassment, school safety, and the school safety plans.
  
Finally, all employees have received training on Mandated 
Reporting.
