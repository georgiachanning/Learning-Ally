By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
District Vision
 
It is the vision for each student to become a
 
life
-
long learner and productive citizen, leading a fulfilled life. Included in the 
vision of the Charter is the drive to enable students to become educated citizens, who will be literate, have problem 
solving skills, be self
-
motivated, able to utilize te
chnology, and become socially responsible.
 
 

 
Linking community traditions to our continuously evolving educational goals of providing universal access is the core of 

n 1921 was the third school built in Kingsburg. The 
Works Project Administration under Franklin D. Roosevelt constructed the current building in 1938.  We are currently an 
all First Grade School. Roosevelt was initially established as a sixth, seventh, and
 
eighth grade school and was restructured 
into a fifth and sixth grade school in 1992. In 1996, the staff of the Kingsburg Elementary School District, in conjunction 
with the citizens of the community, adopted a charter school compact. This allowed Rooseve
lt School to become a charter 
school within the Kingsburg Elementary School District, the second in the State. Through this living document, the charter, 
Roosevelt, has been able to adopt creative methods of educating, using researched
-
based best practices
, while 
maintaining the traditional high standards expected by the Kingsburg Community.
 
 
Roosevelt is a family of 223 students and 31 staff members with a commitment to excellence.   With the unique grade 
configuration of the schools in our District, there
 
is a common thread that unites the students as they transition into and 
out of the schools throughout the years. Together, they develop strong friendships where diversity is welcomed. The staff 
takes pride in knowing generations of families. Roosevelt has
 
developed a strong partnership with the community it 
serves, where high expectations for academic standards, citizenship, community service, recreation, and traditional values 
are embraced in the framework of a caring community. The parent community who w
orks alongside our students on a 
regular basis are evidence of this fact.
 
 
The Roosevelt staff is a highly
-
qualified and enthusiastic group of professionals, who are dedicated to bringing out the 
best qualities in our students, ourselves, and in the work t
hat we do together. We are truly an organization that respects 
learning, honors teaching, and teaches for understanding. The staff collaborates in many ways, with a focus on the 
academic success of each student embedded into every aspect of planning, organ
ization, and use of resources

materials, 
fiscal and personnel. The maintenance staff is an important part of the learning community, taking pride in making this 
historical building a place where students and staff are honored to attend. In addition to main
taining grounds and facilities, 

Roosevelt is proud to be a member of the Kingsburg Elementary Community Charter District.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Roosevelt Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Safety of students 
and staff is a primary concern of Roosevelt Elementary School.
 
 
The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and State 
earthquake standards. A
t the beginning of the year the staff and school site council review the safety plan. Key elements 
of the safety plan include identifying the level of a potential threat, protective options, staff initial action/response, 
incident coordinator, and incident
 
management team. We practice fire drills once a month and earthquake as well as 
lockdown drills at least twice a year.
 
 
The teachers, paraprofessionals, and the principal supervise students continuously throughout the day. There are 
designated areas for s
tudent drop
-
off and pick
-

be displayed at all times. Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District encourages volunteers in the classroom, field trips, 
and with special projects.
 
All school volunteers in direct contact with students are required to complete a District 

clears all volunteers with the local police 
department through an automated record check. Volunteers working more than 
10 days per month will need to fill out additional forms and submit to fingerprinting.
 
 
The Safety Plan was reviewed with staff on: August 2019
