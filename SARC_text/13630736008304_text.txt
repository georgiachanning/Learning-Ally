By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
The school district held a public 
hearing on September 24, 2019 and on December 10, 2019, and determined that each 
school within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of
 
California. All students, including English Learners, are given their 
own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are ado
pted according to a cycle developed by the California 
Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use 
by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the scho
ol Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the qualit

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Built in 1960, the school is situated on nine acres. School buildings span more than 47,000 square feet, and consist of thirt
y 
permanent classrooms, ten portable classrooms, a multipurpose room, a li
brary, a playground, an art lab, administrative 
offices, restrooms, and storage rooms.  During the summer of 2015, our school installed a large shade structure and 
bleacher area, which provides us with a platform to host school wide assemblies, student rec
ognition events, and many 
other engaging activities for school and community.
 
 
Cleaning Process & Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A team of three full time 
custodians and one gardener en
sure that  classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe every day. 
A summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the district office. The site administration team along 
with the Maintenance, Operations, and Trans
portation Manager create daily schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. 
On going communication occurs between the custodial team, site administrators, and staff.

Maintenance & Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Opera
tions. The district administers a scheduled 
maintenance program, including regular facilities inspections to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good repair. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and high
est priority to emergency 
repairs. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  Monthly 
safety meetings occur between the site administrators, custodial lead, and grade level representatives. The 
chart shows 
the results of the most recent school facilities inspection. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor 
discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the 
process o
f remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing  building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The staff at Phil D. Swing School realizes the positive correlation between parent involvement and successful students. 
The mutual involvement will help promote the social, emotional, and academic growth for each and every student on 
campus. For this reaso
n, Phil D. Swing Elementary School continually searches for avenues to involve parents and 
community to participate in the education of our students.

The purpose of our School Site Council and the English 
Language Advisory Council is multifaceted. It includes the 
promotion of academic excellence while creating a spirit of cooperation between parents, staff and students; the 
development of the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA), and its implementatio
n, assessment, and modification 
to reflect changing improvement needs and priorities; and it creates a forum for questions relating to the school and its 
improvement.
 
 
Local businesses lend their support by providing incentives to support student achieveme
nt, attendance, and effort. 
Throughout the school year, students are rewarded for positive choices as well as positive citizenship. It is greatly 
appreciated that so many community members and businesses continue to support education in our community.
 
 
In 
addition to the opportunities listed above, the school and PTO also organize various events and activities that benefit 
greatly from parent support. Examples of activities include our fall/winter festival movie nights, book fairs, lunch on the 
lawn, and a 
number of other events to support the students. The staff of Phil D. Swing School continues to support parent

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Phil D. Swing Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is in 
compliance with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Fire, 
earthquake, lockdown, secure campus and disaster drills are held monthly throughout the school year.  The school is a 
closed campus with one point of entry.  While visitors
 
are welcome at Phil Swing, they are expected to check in at the 
front office, show an ID and obtain a visitor's pass.  Visitors are required to return to the office upon departure. School 
grounds are monitored before, during, and after school by assigned 
staff including administration, campus security, 
teachers, support staff, and duty supervisors to ensure a safe and orderly environment.  In addition, all official parent 
volunteers receive a thorough background check through the department of justice befo
re receiving permission to 
volunteer on campus.
 
 
Brawley Elementary School District established a very detailed disaster plan for each of its schools in the event of a 
disaster. The plan clearly explains specific duties and responsibilities for all 
levels of staff and site personnel, including 
aides, custodians, health  services personnel, cafeteria staff, and the librarian, and is designed to ensure student and staf
f 
safety during a disaster. The Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the distri
ct in consultation with local law 
enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. The plan is updated and amended annually by the School 
Site Council in order to ensure that it is properly implemented. An updated copy of the plan is available 
to the public at 
the district office.
 
 
The Safety Plan was designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and 
maintaining a safe school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of p
revention and 
intervention techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and student. Components of the 
Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, 
di
saster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, the sexual harassment policy, the dress 
code, and procedures related to the compliance of existing laws as they affect school safety.
 
 
Phil D. Swing School annually evaluates a
nd updates the plan with the school staff and members of the School Site Council 
(SSC). The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe 
School Plan, are reviewed with school and district st
aff in the fall, at the start of each school year. The plan was last 
updated and reviewed with school staff in the fall of 2019.  The plan also receives an annual evaluation and review by the 
School Site Council. New information is immediately distributed 
to all staff.

intensive work with WestEd to provide English Learners with language instruction 
coupled with CCSS.  In addition, we have
