School Description
 
Riverview Elementary School is a public school located in Lakeside in San Diego County.  This unique 
school offers two distinct immersi
on models with a 21st Century skills focus. The mission of the 
school is to provide students with a world
-
class immersion program such that they can speak, read, 
and write in multiple languages: to prepare them for an ever
-
developing world of technology, 
c
ultivate an awareness and respect for other cultures, and empower them as future leaders of a 
global society. This mission is based on the following beliefs: 1) The understanding of multiple 
languages and cultures promotes the development of multiculturali
sm and a harmonious world, 2) 
All students should have an opportunity to receive the best possible education and to see 
themselves as global students who understand the value and potential of their multicultural skills.
 
 
At Riverview, students are 
taught in Spanish, Mandarin and English. Students are taught these three 
languages for two distinct reasons.  A person able to speak Mandarin, Spanish, and English can 

antage 
in a global society.  In addition, teaching students in these three languages stimulates different 
parts of the brain and provides students the neural capacity to learn character
-
based and tonal 
languages as well as alphabet
-
based languages. Researc
h shows that younger is better when 
learning languages and there are numerous cognitive and educational benefits resulting from 
multilingualism.
 
 

model, students receive 100 percent instruction in Spanish including Mandarin enrichment in 
kindergarten and first grade.  English instruction is initiated in grade t
wo (2) at approximately 10 
percent of the instructional time and Mandarin increases to 30 minutes, three times a week.  The 
percentage of English instruction increases through the grades. Chinese instruction continues three 
times a week for forty minutes. 
All language instruction begins in kindergarten and progresses 
through the fifth grade. Students continue their language studies at Lakeside Middle School and 
Tierra del Sol Middle School. The second model is the Chinese immersion model.  In this model, 
st
udents receive half of their instruction, K
-
5, in Mandarin and the other half in English including 
Spanish enrichment lessons as well.
 
 
Multilingualism is not the only focus in helping fulfill the mission of this unique program.  Twenty
-
first
-
century skill
s and technology are also an important focus. Technology is considered a fourth 
language and students use different forms of technology and multimedia beginning in 
kindergarten. Additionally, students are taught to think critically, collaborate, and use th
eir 
creativity on a daily basis. The arts and PE are integrated daily to ensure the whole child is educated. 
The school
-
wide PBIS teaches and 7 Keys to Excellence teach students to take responsibility through 
leadership, for their learning and their school
. Through careful planning and integration of content, 
language, and 21st
-
century skills, Riverview staff, students, and families have created an 
exceptional educational program that is preparing students to be future global leaders.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Riverview is in excellent condition and well maintained. Riverview was built in the 1950s. Riverview undergoes maintenance on
 
a regular basis. An online 
system of work orders is used to facilitate main
tenance requests. The district maintenance crew responds quickly and is very proactive in maintaining 
and improving the campus.
 
 
Modernization construction occurred several years ago. During modernization, all walls, roofs, floors, plumbing, and electric
al
 
were updated to reflect 
current demands including technology upgrades. Apple TVs were added to every classroom along with other high
-
quality technology upgrades. 
Restrooms and fire alarm systems were updated, along with heating and cooling systems, to ens
ure energy
-
efficient use. Sites are cleaned daily and any 
graffiti removed immediately by custodial staff.  New portable classrooms were added to accommodate the growth of the school.
 
 
The parking and pick
-
up areas were redesigned two years ago to accommod
ate an increase in traffic due to increasing enrollment. Parking and pick
-
up 
procedures were redesigned to ensure student safety.
 
 
Several years ago, significant concrete and landscape work was completed to enhance both the safety and the aesthetics of the
 
campus. A Peace Pole 
and PeaceBuilders mural adds to the culture on the campus. Six years ago, parents and community volunteers worked alongside d
istrict and school site 
staff to create a beautiful, safe and modern new play structure, outdoor classroom, p
icnic tables, and planter benches for our students to enjoy.
 
 

invited to visit the garden 
for science lessons or to read a book or 
work independently in a small group.  Riverview teaches Postive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) to all 
students and the PBIS play a significant role in establishing the culture of the school. Student leadership is also a signifi
cant part of the Riverv
iew 
experience with students participating in a Student Council team that provides subcommittees of students to lead campus safet
y/security, yearbook, 
annual kickball tournament, and various other opportunities around the school.
 
 
To determine the conditio
n of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Fa
cilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

erview Elementary School. Parents and community members are encouraged to become 
partners with the school as room parents, volunteers, and PTSA members. These opportunities include programs facilitated and 
implemented by parents; 
such as Everyone a Reader 
which helps students read more and develop a love of reading.
 
 
Opportunities for parents in the governance of the school include service on the School Site Council and District Advisory Co
mmittee.  Riverview staff 
and parents participate in the LCAP proces
s at the district and site levels to help develop goals and a plan to guide the work of the district and site.
 
 
Educational events bring the school, families, and the community together. The largest of these events is the International F
air.  Last year, ap
proximately 
1,500 people attended the International Fair. Additional significant events include a Jog
-
a
-
Thon, Fall Festival, and guest readers celebrating Love of 
Reading Week, a Science Night celebrating Eye on Science Week, and a Chinese New Year Celebra
tion. Other opportunities for parental involvement 

-
annual parent
-
teacher conferences, Parent Information 
Nights, and Open House.
 
 
With the help of PTSA, Rivervie
w is able to provide exciting field trips each year for each child. Parents are encouraged to chaperone field trips. The PTSA
 
also helps the school provide high
-
quality assemblies, Mad Science for Eye on Science Week, and performing arts activities.  Addit
ionally, parents have 
the opportunity to host international students as they visit the United States to attend Riverview Elementary School.

State Priority: School Climate
 
T
he SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Riverview 
Elementary campus is a safe and secure campus. A perimeter fence deters entrance except in front of the office. All visitors,
 
including 
parents, must sign in on a computerized screening program from Ident
-
a
-
Kid and wear a badge. The principal, staff, and a
 
morning and lunch campus 
supervisor monitor campus security consistently throughout the school day. Security cameras also help to monitor campus safet
y.
 
 
The Riverview Elementary School Safety Plan is a complete Safety Plan covering all areas designated b
y the state of California. The safety plan addresses 
the physical environment, social environment and culture, emergency/disaster procedures, and school board policy and procedur
es. The safety plan is 
broken down into four key areas:  mitigation and preven
tion, preparedness, recovery, and response. Safety procedures including fire, disaster and 
lockdown drills are practiced through the year. The complete plan is on file, updated annually, and available at the school o
ffice.  The staff reviews the 
plan befor
e school starts, and changes are made to accommodate any new staff members and then drills are practiced throughout the schoo
l year. A flip 
chart outlining LUSD emergency procedures is posted in each classroom and the office.
 
 
Practice and training is ongo
ing with disaster drills varying in the type of disaster on a bi
-
monthly basis. The Blackboard Connect
-
Ed system is used for 
emergency communication. The system can be used with or without power from a cell phone, providing instant information to all
 
paren
ts. Community 

d San Diego County to 
discuss safety issues for each of the sites. These meetings are designed to bring together loca
l police and fire officials, planning officials, district and site 
administration to discuss and address safety issues concerning schools.

Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they 
teach. Professional development 
occurs several days before school starts as well as throughout the year.  Professional Development has included higher level 
questioning strategies, 
common core instruction, Learning Headquarters Common Core Writing instruct
ion, Math Transformations, immersion strategies and assessment, and 
technology.  Professional Learning Communities and opportunities for teachers to share data results and collaborate around be
st practices occur monthly.
 
 
Across the District:
 
 
SCIENCE 

 
 
T
he primary areas of focus for staff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation Sc
ience Standards (NGSS) 
and moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus areas include: 1) Building leadership cap
acity, 2) Scaling up Professional Learning

and Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Co
llaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5) Addressing supplemental instructional
 
materials.
 
 
Professional development needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Science Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedback data collected via prior profession
al learning events in the district.
 
 
Professional Learning for the 2019
-
2020 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and content training.  This will occur primarily
 
through science lesson study for all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
Core Leadership Team and established Teacher Leaders wil
l continue to receive training in the areas of Leadership, Facilitation of Professional Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation In
itiative Program.  

l other district teachers) teachers will be provided NGSS professional learning facilitated by their district Teacher Leader 
peers through 
the established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district PD days.
 
Other opportunities for sci
ence professional learning include supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.
 
 
Administrator professional learning will address NGSS innovatio
ns, strategies to identify and support high
-
quality science instruction (observations and 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both on
-
site and through district management meetings via the Early Implementer Initiative.
 
 
Next 
Generation Science Standards Teacher Leaders, Expansion Teachers, and administrators are supported via NGSS Early Implementat
ion Initiative 
Project Director, on
-
site Core Leadership Team members and/or Teacher Leaders.
 
 
MATH 

 
 
LUSD focused on 
mathematics as a professional development goal in response to low
-
performance scores on the CAASPP and to support teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.
 
 
Professional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways:  1) Worksh
ops (after school, on professional growth days, and during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and small group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
Teachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and use of curric
ulum materials through 1) Workshops focused on the content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math content they teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content and practice s
tandards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on unit and lesso
n design with their curriculum materials (within school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
both in one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning activities 
an
d receive additional training from a leadership perspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
Social
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus areas in the 19
-
20 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselo
rs continue the work of supporting the social and emotional needs of students.   Two Behavior Specialists 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support students with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Two MTS
S Teachers on Special 
Ass
ignment (TOSAs) were added to support the development of social/emotional/behavioral intervention systems at four of our Elem
entary sites.
 
 
Professional Development and Coaching have focused on Conscious Classroom Management strategies.  Conscious Classroo
m Teaching provides teachers 
with professional development and coaching on Tier I and II behavioral strategies.  MTSS TOSAs are also available to coach on
 
classroom management 
strategies and student behavior plans.
 
 
Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School Dist
rict continues to support principal growth through Professional Development and has deepened our support of teacher leaders 
in the 2018
-
2019 school year. Teacher leaders (Facilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as c
ontent support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Learning. The Facilitators, in turn, provide on
-
site coaching to their respective staffs.

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 
2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 

include facilities costs or 
deferred maintenance. Approximately three
-
fourths of the revenues go toward the salaries of teachers, s
pecialists, auxiliary personnel, books, supplies, 
and equipment.
 
 
Riverview offers exceptional programs for its students despite the impact on budgets this past year. State funding is used fo
r curriculum to support 
instruction towards mastery of the Common
 
Core State Standards, integrating Spanish and Mandarin with Common Core Content Standards.
 
 
District funds provide for instrumental music instruction in the upper grades for interested students. PTSA funds help pay fo
r additional visual, dance, 
and music 
artists. PTSA funds also help pay for high
-
quality online learning tools and field trip opportunities for every child. Riverview also offers incredible 
student leadership programs for over 200 students including the Student Lighthouse Team, for 4th and 5th
 
grade students and the Challenge class for 
students who excel in their target language and English.
 
 
To make comparisons possible across schools and districts of varying sizes, we first report our overall spending per student.
 
We base our calculations on 
our average daily attendance (ADA).
 
 

se. Restricted funds, 
however, must be spent for specific purposes set out by legal requiremen
ts or the donor. Examples include funding from Local Control Funding Formula 
Base and Supplemental funds, State Lottery funds, and Library/Literacy funds.
 
 

s spending varies from the district and state averages.
 
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional infor
mation about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, s
taffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public 
locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a wor
kstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
