About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Marshall Elementary parents are invited to several Family Learning evenings organized by teachers and supported by Title 1 fu
nds. These events focus 
on supporting literacy and on supporting math instruction. This year our Marshall Book Club holds mo
nthly meetings supporting reading comprehension 
over breakfast once a month in our Response to Intervention (RtI) classroom.  This program is run by teachers and also suppor
ts parents by giving

School Safety Plan
 
Marshall's Safety Plan is revised annually each fall by the Site Safety Committee, which is comprised of the principal and me
mbers of the teaching staff 
and parents. Emergenc
y drills are held on a monthly basis: fire (evacuation) and earthquake (duck and cover) drills are conducted once a month and
 
secure campus drills are held annually. A Disaster Preparedness committee of parents and staff routinely assesses and updates
 
the 
emergency shed for 
necessary supplies. It is anticipated that these materials would be used if a large scale disaster occurred that would requir
e students to remain on campus 
for a significant period of time. The plan was last updated in September of 2018.
 
At that time, each member of the teaching staff checked his/her 
emergency backpack for essential supplies. Depleted or used items were restocked and new tools were added. An emphasis has be
en placed on campus 
safety and security. Teachers and campus super
visors monitor students on campus before school, during recess and lunchtime. All visitors must register 
at the school's office and receive proper authorization to be at the school. Visitors are asked to have their badges prominen
tly displayed for student 
safety. The school underwent security upgrades in the summer of 2008, including the installation of security fencing and incr
eased campus lighting.
 
 
Marshall Elementary staff, parents and students believe in developing and maintaining a positive school env
ironment. School wide rules and discipline 
policies support a safe environment conducive to student learning. School personnel monitor student issues and work with the 
school counselor intern 
to assist individual and small groups of students, and increase 
student emotional support.
 
 
Marshall staff, parents, and students work together to create a safe and healthy school climate.

Each year there have been two days of professional development during the school 
year. Professional Development occurs on set aside days, during the 
school day and after school. The staff analyzed assessment data and determined that a focus on subgroups for the staff develo
pment was most 
appropriate. Several teachers participated in th
e Language Arts Development training presented by the Tri
-
Valley Teacher Induction program. Teachers 
attended these trainings during the course of the school day. After
-
school training focused on the Academic Language necessary for second language 
learner 
success.  Marshall Elementary continues to send credentialed teaching staff to AVID (Advancement via Individual Determination
) training and 
conferences to support student academic success.  Currently, Marshall staff is 100% trained in AVID techniques, with
 
many teachers attending multiple 
conferences and training to support students and fellow staff.  Marshall continues to look for Professional Development oppor
tunities to support staff 
and students including GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) and Mi
ke Mattos training in the area of Response to Intervention.
