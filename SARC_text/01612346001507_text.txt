By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional Development is ongoing and selected for varying reasons. Some professional development, for example 
curriculum based professional development, is provided on an on
-
going basis. Last year we adopted new 
math curriculum. 
Professional development was provided before the school year started to orient teachers on the new materials. This year 
a mathematics Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) is providing professional development and coaching for teachers. 
Oth
er professional development is selected based on student achievement data both at the school level and the district 
level. This year we have also been focused on the implementation of STEAM and Next Generation Science Standards.
 
 
Last year our site based p
rofessional development focused on Professional Learning Communities. This year we continue 
that work and  have  designated most of our weekly staff meeting time for Professional Learning Community professional 
development, mindfulness training, and studen
t data analysis.
 
 
New teachers throughout the district participate in the Induction  program which is a  standards
-
based program that 
provides support and professional development for first and second year teachers through mentoring, training, and 
evaluati
on.  Teachers being evaluated select professional development based on self reflection on the California Standards 
for the Teaching Professional. Permanent teachers being evaluated also have a peer coach and their work together often 
includes professional 
development.
 
 
Professional development is offered on district wide professional development days, after
-
school collaboration and 
professional learning community time, at conferences throughout the year, and by working with other teachers in the 
school and/
or district and visiting their classrooms.
 
 
Professional Development Days are provided each year.  During the 2018
-
2019 school year and the 2017
-
2018 educators 
received three days of professional development.
