Description
 
Our
 
vision
 
is
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
community
 
of
 
passionate,
 
lifelong
 
learners
 
with
 
a
 
strong
 
sense
 
of
 
citizenship.
 
 
 
The
 
Carrillo
 
Family
 
believes
 
all
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning
 
begins
 
with
 
strong
 
connections
 
and
 
authentic
 
relationships
 
within
 
our
 
community.
 
Since
 
each
 
child
 
learns
 
in
 
a
 
different
 
way
 
and
 
at
 
a
 
different
 
rate,
 
we
 
are
 
dedicated

the

By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be

with
 
data
 
reported
 
in

Carrillo
 
Elementary
 
School
 
opened
 
its
 
beautiful,
 
well-supplied,
 
state-of-the-art
 
facility
 
on
 
August
 
6,
 
1999.
 
Our
 
school
 
includes
 
six
 
building
 
sections,
 
of
 
which
 
three
 
are
 
portables.
 
We
 
have
 
44
 
classrooms,
 
a
 
multipurpose
 
room,
 
a
 
library,
 
a
 
computer
 
lab,
 
a
 
STEM
 
Lab,
 
on-campus
 
buildings
 
(for
 
before
 
and
 
after
 
school
 
daycare)
 
and
 
an
 
administration
 
building.
 
Each
 
classroom
 
is
 
equipped
 
with
 
numerous
 
resources
 
for
 
student
 
use.
 
Each
 
classroom
 
also
 
includes
 
a
 
document
 
camera,
 
projector,
 
and
 
teacher
 
laptop.
 
We
 
recently
 
added
 
a
 
large
 
screen
 
&
 
LCD
 
projector
 
in
 
our
 
multipurpose
 
room
 
to
 
facilitate
 
professional
 
development
 
and
 
parent
 
workshops.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
site
 
licenses
 
for
 
Dreambox,
 
Reflex
 
Math,
 
Lexia,
 
Kodable,
 
BrainPOP
 
Jr.,
 
and
 
numerous
 
other
 
apps
 
and
 
computer
 
programs
 
used
 
by
 
students
 
daily.
 
Our
 
office,
 
computer
 
lab,
 
library,
 
and
 
multipurpose
 
room
 
effectively
 
support
 
our
 
programs.
 
 
Cleaning
 
Process
 
and
 
Schedule
 
The
 
district
 
governing
 
board
 
has
 
adopted
 
cleaning
 
standards
 
for
 
all
 
schools
 
in
 
the
 
district.
 
A
 
summary
 
of
 
these
 
standards
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school
 
office
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
district
 
office.
 
The
 
principal
 
works
 
daily
 
with
 
the
 
custodial
 
staff
 
to
 
develop
 
cleaning
 
schedules
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
clean
 
and
 
safe
 
school.

Parents
 
are
 
a

of
 
our
 
educational
 
program.
 
Parent

approves
 
our
 
annual
 
School

for

Achievement
 
and
 
our

We
 
have
 
a
 
growing
 
number
 
of
 
parents
 
who
 
attend
 
our
 
English
 
Learner
 
Advisory
 
Council
 
meetings
 
as
 
well.
 
Large
 
numbers
 
of
 
parents
 
provide
 
regular
 
in-class
 
and
 
out

assistance.
 
Our

is
 
tireless
 
in
 
supporting
 
academic
 
and
 
social
 
needs
 
of
 
our

and
 
is
 
our

One
 
of

on
 
our
 
research-based

the
