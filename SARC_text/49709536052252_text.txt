School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

they enjoy the art room and the school garden. We have also added an AVID Elementary program TK

preparing all scholars for college
 
and career readiness. We believe that closing the opportunity and achievement gap starts

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our facilities are in good condition. While some of our buildings contain classic features such as 
cloak rooms and large, 
sunny windows, in the past fifteen years there was modernization of the classrooms, library, and administration building. 
Our PTO purchased a new computer lab for our school during the 2008
-
09 school year. The multi
-
purpose room has 
attractive wood floors and serves as our cafeteria as well as the place for school assemblies and large school functions. 
The school landscaping is beautiful, and we have up
-
to
-
date playground equipment. A covered walkway protects students 
and staff on rai
ny days. We also  erected a solar energy array of panels that double as a shade structure for our playground. 
We are creating a cool picnic area for student use complete with murals on the support poles.  Our facilities contain the 
best elements of a class
ic and modern school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
We ensure that Dunbar is a safe school in a manner consistent with Federal law, the California Education Code, governing 
board policies, and district administrative rules. To ensure student discipline and safety, the school staff adheres to the 
procedures outlined in the Dunbar Elementary School Student Discipline Plan. Documents are updated annually and 
shared with staff and the school families. We also have a School Safety Plan that is reviewed annually and by our School 
Site Council. We are cu
rrently revising and updating our plan. We practice regular safety procedures including fire drills, 
school lock
-
downs, earthquake preparedness and fire safety. Fire safety assemblies are conducted annually by the local 
fire department. We also do school
-
w
ide safety programs such as PBIS Safe School Ambassadors, and Responsive 
Classroom. As a staff, we are currently participating in a series of trauma trainings, with a focus on fostering a trauma
-
informed school environment that aims to support our students
 
academically, socially, and emotionally.

Dunbar utiilzes a multi
-
tiered system of support. Our first tier targets best first instruction and supplemental support 
through differentiated instruction. Our second tier incorporates intervention classes during the 
school day with our 
intervention teacher. Intervention programs help students who need additional help with English or math. Our goal is that 
all students are reading at grade level by the end of third grade and are English proficient by the time they leav
e 
elementary school.
 
 
The FODS/PTO and student leadership also raise money to enhance the physical and intellectual environment at Dunbar.
 
We have received generous grants and donations from many organizations, including the Sonoma Valley Education 
Foundation, the Occidental Ecology center, the Wine Country Film Festival, the Rotary Club and Plein Air. Additionally, our  
school events such a
s our Halloween carnival and the Lasseter Family Winery supports our garden efforts. Funds raised or 
donated support technology goals, our garden, our art center, field trips, and other enrichment activities designed to 
support and enhance our standards ba
sed learning.
 
 
We have used both State and Federal monies to provide our students with support services, including additional adults, 
such as instructional assistants in the classroom to support student learning. We also utilize a bilingual community liais
on 
to provide outreach, communication and a sense of belonging to all our families at Dunbar. Finally, we use our funds to 
purchase supplemental materials for students who need extra help in reaching their achievement goals. All students are 
focused on rea
ching proficient and advanced levels of performance at Dunbar Elementary School.

Districtwide PD opportunities offer multiple experiences pertaining to moving forward the work we have been focusing 
on (Bridges Math, equity, SEL, ELD, AVID, etc.). These days are all day non student days in which educators are able to 
engage in learning 
throughout the course of the day. At site, we have offered professional learning as outlined in our 
school site plan. These include focuses on areas such as AVID (supporting all learners in achieving high expectations), 
Trauma Informed Practices, etc. The 
methods vary from during school with release time, summer conferences, individual 
mentoring, after school workshops, etc. Teachers and staff are supported in implementation through our grade
-
level 
collaboration times, in
-
class coaching and check ins, and s
taff meetings.
