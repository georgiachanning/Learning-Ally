School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

publication submitted and chooses the textbook that will work best for the students at Frazier Park School. Every student, 
including English Learners, ha

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

cla
ssroom, both the teacher and the students receive much needed help and the students see that their education is 
important to their parent as well. Everyone benefits as parent involvement increases. When parents arrive to volunteer 
at the school, please che
ck in at the office, sign in in our volunteer log and get a volunteer badge before going to the 
classroom.
 
 
Another way that parents can get involved here at Frazier Park School is through the 2nd Grade Reading Program. This is 
a Kern County sponsored prog
ram designed to help struggling readers improve their reading ability. We have seen 
tremendous results and look forward to continued improvement with greater volunteer participation. To become involved 
call the coordinator at 661

-
3312 or you can email 
Mr. Forrester at mforrester@el
-
tejon.org.
 
 
As required for Title I advisory purposes, Frazier Park School has a School Site Council (SSC) with strong parental 
representation.  SSC meets the third Tuesday of every month. We also have an active Frazier Park 
School PTSO 
organization. We encourage parents to become involved with PTSO.  PTSO meetings are held the first Tuesday of every 
month in the staff lounge next to the office. For further information please contact Cristal Vivirito, the PTSO President, at

Students and staff participate in regularly scheduled fire, disaster training, active shooter, and lockdown drills. The Kern 
County Fire Department assesses the adequacy of emergency procedures and 
conducts yearly school safety inspections, 
all in accordance with a comprehensive School Safety Plan developed by a committee of staff and community members, 
which is updated annually. Additionally, Frazier Park School and all schools in the El Tejon Unifi
ed School District now 

 
 
Included in the School Safety Plan is a specific Emergency Plan that addresses emergency preparedness, and is in 
compliance with California Standardized Emer
gency Management Systems (SEMS). This plan was developed in 
cooperation with local officials, and includes specific courses of action to be taken in case of an emergency. Emergency 
supplies are kept in each classroom, and school
-
wide emergency supplies are
 
stored in a shipping container on campus. 
All plans were last reviewed and updated in October 2018.
 
 
On a daily basis, yard and cafeteria supervision is provided by both classified and certificated personnel. In order to provi
de 
maximum security for all s
tudents, all visitors must report to the school office to obtain visitor passes. All classroom doors 
remain locked during school hours. If a "lockdown" is enacted, besides the locked doors, additional measures are taken 
within the classroom. We are fortuna
te to have the assistance of our local Sheriff Department that assists us in our efforts 
to be prepared in any emergency.
