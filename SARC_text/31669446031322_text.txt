School Description
 
At Truckee Elementary, all students will experience a balanced education addressing the needs of 
the whole child. For all children to succeed, it is necessary to integrate
 
social, emotional, and 
physical development with a strong academic program. A challenging academic focus will provide 
the foundation for the acquisition and mastery of the basic skills, in areas of reading, writing, 
mathematics, science and humanities. Wi
th this foundation, children will acquire the tools to be 
successful in all subject areas.We expect all students to be responsible learners, to self
-
evaluate, to 
accept challenges, and to be solution seekers. In preparing for the future, students will have
 
the 
skills to access information and utilize available resources for the further learning. Learning will take 
place in a positive, safe, and cooperative environment that values individual differences and fosters 
a feeling of community. We are committed to
 
providing a quality education to all students, and we 
are proud to be a community hub.
 
 
Climate for Learning
 
At Truckee Elementary School  we value student voice. Opportunities for input are provided 
through class meetings, restorative circles, student leadership groups, 
surveys, and the 
development of healthy living practices.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the 
condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet
 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the
 
California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

nced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible student
s 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent and community involvement helps our school thrive. School Site Council, English Learne
r Advisory Committee (ELAC), and the Parent Teacher 
Organization (PTO) provide many opportunities for parent participation. The PTO volunteers put on fundraising events to provi
de additional resources 
for our students, including enrichment and athletics. P
arents are always welcome and encouraged to volunteer at the school and in the classroom and 
on field trips. The English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC) provides another opportunity for parent involvement. We also have
 
a School Site Council (SSC) 
whose rol
e is to review student achievement data and decide upon the use of the school budget as it relates to the school's efforts to
 
improve and 
enhance the instructional program for all students. Volunteer opportunities are many; some examples include Harvest of
 
the Month's healthy food 
lessons, Watch D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students), weekly help in the classroom, supporting field study trips, and participati
ng in special events. Our 
families are diverse, and we welcome all parent involvement that reflects this 
diversity.

School Safety Plan
 
Tahoe Truckee Unified School District 
 
 
Truckee Elementary School
 
 
Safe School Plan
 
 
Senate Bill 187 ensures that all California public schools, grades K 

 
12, work in cooperation with local law enforcement, community leaders, parents, 
pupils, 
teachers, administrators, and other persons in the prevention of campus crime and violence, and in developing comprehensive s
chool safety plans 
that target the safety concerns identified through TTUSD

s systematic planning process which involves Truckee El
ementary School

s Site Safety 
Committee, the site

s Site Safety Lead, the TTUSD District Safety Committee, participation in the Youth Task Force, and other established communi
ty 
collaborations and partnerships.
 
 
Encompassing more than 720 square miles, Tah
oe Truckee Unified School District is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, 100 miles northeast of 
Sacramento, and 35 miles west of Reno, Nevada. The District serves more than 4,000 students in California

s Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado Counties. 
Distric
t boundaries stretch from Hobart Mills, eight miles north of Truckee, to Emerald Bay, near South Lake Tahoe; and from Cisco G
rove, twenty miles 
to the west, to Floriston, fifteen miles to the east.
 
 
About Truckee Elementary School

of Education data, the 2018

2019 student population consisted of 59% Hispanic or Latino; 37% White; 46% English Learners, and 58% Socioeconomically

Truckee Unified School District better ensures top
-
notch teaching and learning is via high
-
quality profe
ssional development (PD.) A variety of options are 
available and range from formal

type workshops or seminars and informal

types such as discussions among colleagues, independent reading, observing 
a colleague's lesson or participating in coaching with one
 
of our many Academic Coaches. The frequency of PD varies with the structure and purpose.

l development for all 
the educators in the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District so that all student
