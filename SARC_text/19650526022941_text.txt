our students grow academically,

successful in a changing and culturally diverse society. The La Rosa mission is to provide students 
optimal learning opportunities through academic rigor, acceptance of self and others, and
 
inspiration to become caring and contributing members of a global society. The school is a school

Caucasian and the remaining 11% are from various ethnicities. Within this student 
population, 41% of our students are socioeconomically disadvantaged, 46% are English Language 
Learners and 9% are students with disabilities. The La Rosa teaching staff cons

As a result of our 1:1, 
student to device ratio, we implement coding on a daily basis in grades K

3. 
In addition to coding, La Rosa also utilizes an adaptive computer program to serve as a means of 
intervention, as well as extension, for our students. The Six Pillars of Character
 
is the primary 

Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) on a school

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
La Rosa Elementary was established in 1950. There are 35 classrooms on the La Rosa campus, three of which are considered port
able. In addition to 
classrooms, La Rosa includes a 
media center/library, one Makerspace room, a computer lab, a cafetoria and a large athletic field. The La Rosa campus is 
in exemplary condition as reported on the 2019 FIT Report.

proceeds, and play surfaces have been reconditioned with the Deferred Maintenance Fund in 2015.
 
 
The La Rosa campus is maintained and school safety ensured by a district maintenance cr
ew of nine and by a site janitorial staff of four. Issues and repairs 
not resolved by the site janitorial crew are completed by the district maintenance crew on a prioritized work
-
order system.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Bala
nced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible student
s 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Parents and stakeholders have many opportunities to be involved and participate in the decision making pro
cess through regularly scheduled School Site 
Council (SSC) meetings, Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA) meetings, as well as the English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC). La Rosa, in partnership with 
the PTA, hosts numerous events throughout the year such as 
Family Fun Nights, Breakfast with Santa, Spirit Days, Movie Nights, and a STEAM night and 
day for the students.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil 
suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
In accordance with Senate Bill 187 and Education Code 35294.6, all schools have adopted a Safe School Action Plan. These plan
s will remain in 
effect 
through the school year, are reviewed annually and are available for public view in the school office. Key elements and goals
 
of the Safe School Action 
Plans are: All students and staff members are provided a safe teaching and learning environment. 
All students are safe and secure while at school, when 
traveling to and from school, and when traveling to and from school
-
related activities. District programs and approved community resources are made 
available to students and parents. Schools provide an
 
educational environment where students, parents, staff and community members shall effectively 
communicate in a manner that is respectful to all cultural, racial and religious backgrounds. The school safety plan was last
 
reviewed, updated and 
discussed wi
th the school faculty in August 2019.

Throughout the year, we provide teachers numerous opportunities to participate in staff development activities to 
improve and maintain their 
professional skills. As a district, we have five pupil
-
free days for professional development each year. The days are devoted to curriculum studies and 
current practices. Teachers also receive training during modified Wednesday w
orkshops and after
-

development has been the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program. This program pairs new teachers with experi
enced teachers who 
serve as mentors and coaches. The ment
ors serve as a resource by providing in
-
service training and meeting one
-
on
-
one to plan instruction. Teachers 
are provided opportunities to study and improve instructional practices through grade
-
level meetings, visitations to other classrooms, participati
on in 
book clubs, and direct training on specific instructional strategies. Each year, the School Site Council sets aside categoric
al monies to provide for 
professional conference opportunities for all teachers.
