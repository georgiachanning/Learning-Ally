School Description
 
It is my pleasure to introduce this annual School Accountability Report Card. The data and 
information contained 
within these pages will prove useful in informing you about our school, 
including but not limited to academic standings, curriculum and instruction, school facilities and 
safety, budget, and facility enhancement.
 
 
As you read our School Accountability Repo
rt Card, you will see a school that ensures every child 
has equal access to a rigorous core curriculum in language arts, mathematics, science, and social 
studies. The hard
-
working staff is both skilled and dedicated to the success of our students. The 
pare
nts and the community organizations are very supportive.
 
 
Our goal in presenting you with this information is to keep our community well informed. If you 
have any questions or are interested in making an appointment to discuss this report, please call 
our 
school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas a
re in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Detailed cleaning is done du
ring vacation periods. The district provides maintenance services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and
 
conduct insp
ections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The District administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable learning env
ironment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working order. Daily reports of in
cidents that require repair at the school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service.
 
 
The District particip
ates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this inc
l
udes roofing, plumbing, 

rred maintenance plan is available 
at the district office.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, o
ur district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

s report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include: child abuse reporting proc
edures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaster response
 
procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment 
policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and discipline policies. The school safety committee and district pers
