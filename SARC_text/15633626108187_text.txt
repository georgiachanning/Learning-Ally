By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Roy W. Loudon Elementary School was dedicated and began to serve students in 1989. The school was named for Roy W. 
Loudon who was a long
-
time member of the Board of Trus
tees in the Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District. He was 
a beekeeper in the community and was responsible for the first written history of the District. He was regarded as a man 
of integrity who was dedicated to the school children of the community. Lo
udon students, the Leopards, are proud of 

established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in November 1988. The Repor
t Card, to be issued 
annually by local school boards for each elementary and secondary school in the state, provides for parents and other 
interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the areas in which 
imp
rovements are needed.
 
 
Roy W. Loudon Elementary School is one of nineteen elementary schools in the Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District. 
Loudon School has earned a reputation in the community as an outstanding educational institution and is known for 
meeting the special learning needs of each student. The staff has established the following goals to help students reach 
their greatest potential:
 
 
All children will read and write confidently, compute math problems accurately, and use higher level thinkin
g skills to 
resolve any challenge. Family and community members will be involved as partners to promote the social, emotional, and 
academic growth of children. The school will provide a safe environment in which children will develop positive character 
tra
its, a sense of responsibility, and effective decision
-
making skills. Every child will develop multi
-
cultural understanding, 
an ability to communicate, and the technological skills necessary to be a contributing member of society.
 
 
Roy W. Loudon Elementary
 
School supports and strives to promote the concept of excellence as defined by the Panama
-
Buena Vista School District. Our mission is to support student learning by maintaining a safe and orderly campus 
environment that is physically and mentally healthy.
 
Within this environment, there exists a classroom setting that is 
stimulating and is responsive to the individual learning styles of all students. Students are challenged academically and 
are accountable for their own actions and achievements. Students de
velop a positive self
-
image through sound principles 
of teaching and learning. Teacher professionalism and commitment are demonstrated by the ongoing emphasis on staff 
development.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Loudon provides a safe and clean environment for learning
.  A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the 
District to ensure all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good learning. 
Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed California Bui

Coordinator of Safety and Risk Management verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The exterior grounds are 
well lit, and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. A t
eam of custodians ensures 
classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized, and secured at the end of 
each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition.
 
 
As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, the saf
ety committee has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our 
students. Staff receives inservice in emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to substitute teachers, 
volunteers, and other visitors as they register in our office. A
ll staff members are issued an identification card that is worn 
above the waist at all times during the instructional day.  The gates on the perimeter of the school playground are locked 
during school hours and staff members are trained to activate lock do
wn procedures in the event of an emergency.  Our 
positive partnership with local law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns arise.
 
 
Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Gro
unds and playground 
equipment are inspected regularly for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of 
its staff development program.  Fire and/or disaster drills occur monthly, and a complete school site disaster 
plan has 
been prepared and is in place and available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins 
officially at 7:20 a.m. when the school opens.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Safe School Plan was communicated and reviewed, updated and discussed with staff on October 9, 2019.  On October 
10, 2019, the Safe School Plan was reviewed and approved by the School Site Council. The School Safety Plan addresses 
student and staff saf
ety through the Incident Command System and organization chart for staff. Students and staff 
participate in monthly safety drills that address evacuations, earthquakes, and lock downs. In addition, the district 
provides an opportunity for each school to pa
rticipate in a district wide disaster preparedness drill.
 
 
Students do their work in an orderly environment that has high standards for achievement and one that provides 
opportunities for recognition in academic and extra
-
curricular activities. Students ar
e recognized for effort and 
achievement in our "Student of the Month" program. Outstanding students are selected from every classroom each 
month, recognized at a special assembly, and are rewarded for their hard work. A monthly theme is used to teach good 
values, citizenship, and civic responsibility.
 
 
Loudon Elementary has a positive learning environment. The goal of Loudon Elementary's discipline program is to provide 
students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewa
rds and consequences for their 
behavior, through our school
-
wide Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS). Loudon Elementary believes students 
who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature both academically and emotionally. Parents and st
udents are 
informed of discipline policies at the beginning of each school year through classroom orientation as well as individual 
parent
-
student handbooks.The Assistant Principal also addresses expectations for student behavior along with suspension 
and 
expulsion policies with each grade level at the beginning of the school year.
 
 
Students with excessive tardies, truancies, or unexcused absences are referred to our assistant principal for intervention 
and support, but may be subject to 
disciplinary action including mandatory parent conferences or a referral to the District 

Program for students who must be absent from 
school due to illness for an extended period of time.
 
 
Loudon establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school experience. 
Appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives to furthe
r develop personal growth and 
responsibility. A school
-
wide discipline plan is enforced, a noon
-
time detention program is used, and problem
-
solving 
strategies are taught to promote appropriate behavior. Suspensions and expulsions occur only when required b
y law or 
when all other alternatives are exhausted.
 
 
At Loudon Elementary, students are encouraged to participate in the school's academic, interscholastic athletics, and 
extra
-
curricular activities that are an integral part of the educational program. Aca
demic recognition is provided through 
academic contests and festivals, quarterly awards assemblies for honor roll and principal's list students, perfect 
attendance, live performances, and exhibitions. Certificates and medals are awarded throughout the year
 
for attendance, 
citizenship, academic performance, and athletic achievement.

ation Act, (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low
-
income families to 
help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. Title I 
is designed to help students served by the 
program to achieve proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards. Title I schools with percentages of 
students from low
-
income families of at least 40 percent may use Title I funds, along with ot
her Federal, State, and local 
funds, to operate a "school wide program" to upgrade the instructional program for the whole school. Based on an analysis 
of student achievement data done be the school site, Title I resources may be used for professional deve
lopment,

program
 
to meet the needs of specifically identified students who are failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet the state's 
challenging academic achievement standards . Both school wide and targeted assistance programs must use instructional 
strategies based o
n scientifically based research and implement parental involvement activities.
