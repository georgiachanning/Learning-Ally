By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-

Happy Valley Elementary School welcomes you!
 
 
Happy Valley Union School District was established in 1954.  Today our elementary campus continues to be committed to 
success fro every student, every day.  We have a beautiful ca
mpus with a full science lab, 14 classrooms, a large 
gymnasium, a new bus barn and a state
-
of
-
the
-
art greenhouse . You will find our students accessing common core 
standards with the use of Chromebooks at each desk.  Our educational programs are taught wit
h fidelity. We believe all 
students can achieve at high levels.  It is our responsibility to set high expectations, promote academic rigor, develop 
strong character and improve student engagement in a safe, student
-
centered environment.
 
 
Happy Valley Eleme
ntary School provides an opportunity for every student to succeed, everyday.  Our school community 
provides a positive learning culture, supported by our faculty, staff, families, and community.  Many of our veteran 
teachers are serving second generation s
tudents, providing a rich history and a promising future for our students.  While 
the ingenuity of another generation of teachers add to the talents among the faculty.  Our teachers are participating in 
ongoing professional development in the specific thre
e goals:  academics, social and emotional learning, and safe school 
community, and improving practices with regard to academics and social emotional learning.  Our teachers are engaged 
in professional learning in the areas of Improvement Science, Restorati
ve Practices, and Trauma Informed Practices, 
curriculum and instruction, and differentiated instruction.  These practices are culminated in a district
-
wide effort to 
provide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) as a framework for sustaining 
student
-
centered learning 
opportunities and academic and social growth.
 
 
Parents are valued partners in our educational system and are encouraged to visit the school, consult with the staff and 
participate in school functions. At Happy Valley Elementary Sc

student
-
led conferences. We routinely hold parent education nights, focusing on academics and college awareness.   Our 
families are present at community events, school assemblies, celebrations, an
d support groups.  Many parents volunteer 
at our school, enhancing our students' learning experience.  Our community is involved in the effort to provide a safe, 
healthy learning environment.  Project Share provides a robust after school program that facil
itates additional supports 
and quality activities to over half of our student population.  While the Citizens Patrol is routinely present at the end of 
the school day, merely to provide a sense of community support and school safety.
 
 
Home to 275 students,
 
we provide quality academic experiences to students from fourth through eighth grade.  Our 
teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff come together to offer all that a student will need to succeed socially and 
academically.  In addition, our school pr
ovides opportunities for future students and our families providing school 
readiness programs, parenting classes, small group support systems, and a family liaison who assists in various scenarios, 
to bridge resources and offer support to our students and 
their families.  We have made a concerted effort to connect 
counseling services with students who may need additional supports.  Individual counseling, group counseling, and whole 
class sessions are offered by various counseling organizations, in order to 
address social skill building, Adverse Childhood 
Experiences (ACE's), and other challenging life experiences.   When students are faced with learning challenges, they also 
have the opportunity to work with a behavior coach who guides them in self
-
regulatio
n, redirection, and the successful 
return to learning.

In order to build capacity among our staff, teachers and staff serve on various teams that are focused on
 
specific goals 
and concerns.  We have developed two leadership teams that focus on our district and school goals as well as a full faculty 
team that is carefully examining data and working together to align our instructional practices to better serve our 
students.  
Focusing on drivers for improving the system, the team believes it will have a direct effect on student learning.  A PBIS 
Team is focused, at the district level, on developing and refining a district
-
wide system that will unify our school commun
ity 
around a common language and a specific plan for success and achievement.  Teachers have selected specific areas for 
professional growth and are engaged in current research and practices to improve student learning.  Paraprofessionals 
and support staff
 
attend meetings regularly, to discuss concerns and build a positive program for supporting our students 
and families.  They also attend training sessions that prepare them to engage in a positive social emotional learning 
environment.
 
 
In order to provide
 
a rigorous and engaging academic experience, teachers have begun a journey to articulate current 
practices through vertical alignment.  Alongside this endeavor to connect prior knowledge to potential learning, teachers 
rely on data to inform instruction. 
 
Time is spent each week, engaged in meaningful collaboration focused on differentiated 
instruction and developing specific academic skills.  Teaching teams prepare their students each day to reach their full 
potential by identifying learning gaps and pres
cribing specific learning experiences to address student needs.
 
 
Our support staff serve with loving kindness and look out for our students and fellow site personnel.  Their dedication to 
our students is evident in their performance each day in the unique 
and important role they each play at our school site.  
The Happy Valley School Community stands proudly to support a positive learning culture for all students.   Pride is 
abundant at Happy Valley Elementary School. We encourage each member of our educatio
nal system to work together 
to provide the highest quality educational program possible. We truly believe it is our mission to be committed to learning 
for all students as they are guided to reach their highest potential.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Chris Dell, Principal

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
12/2019
 
 
Textbook selection occurs primarily by teachers from the state
-
approved lists. Teachers attend presentations by 
publishers, examine the program choices, and may even teach lessons from the program. In the past, 
teachers have 
sometimes piloted a program prior to district adoption. Once the teachers have narrowed their choices, parents and the 
community are invited to examine the curriculum. The selection choices are brought before the School Site Council. Final 
ap
proval is by school board adoption.
 
 
The district meets the state guidelines for textbooks and instructional materials. The district has affirmed that each pupil,
 
including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Happy Valley Elementary School was built in the 1950s. The campus
 
was modernized the summer of 2003. The 21
-
room 
school is completely up

the
-
art greenhouse, wireless Internet connection in all 
classrooms, Promethean interactive boards and document cameras in classrooms, and Chromeboo
ks for each student. 
The campus hosts two baseball fields, a soccer field, a full size gymnasium and a spacious playground. The school district 
is a proud recipient of a Healthy Student Initiatives grant that has helped to update and refresh the cafeteria 
space. The 
floor has been replaced and the interior has been repainted.
 
 
The campus is cleaned daily and has a regular summer and holiday program of maintenance and improvements. The 
facility and grounds are safe and clean. There are two full
-
time 
custodians and one maintenance person at each site. This 
crew routinely meets and schedules repairs and projects. Checklists are utilized to ensure the campus is pristine. Our 
school provides a safe, clean, and functional environment for learning through p
roper facilities maintenance and campus 
supervision.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and the security of the campus are the highest priorities of Happy Valley Elementary School. 
Students are signed in and out of the front office, and the adults signing for them must be listed on th

emergency card. All visitors are required to sign in at the front office.
 
We have an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) synthesized with current Readiness and Emergency Management Systems 
(REMS) practices and our local needs.  The plan identifies 
protocols and responsible parties for numerous types of 
emergencies.  School personnel and students participate in preparedness drills, including procedures for fire, earthquake, 
lockdown and civil disturbance. The plan identifies roles, responsibilities, 
functional annexes, how to address the situations 
before, during, and after any emergency situation.  Maintenance and upkeep are monitored, and Deferred Maintenance  
Plan is developed and reviewed yearly.
 
The school works closely with the local volunteer f

open communication and up to date protocol. The Happy Valley Fire Department is located across the street from the 
campus and it is always available to assist in medical emergencies.
 
The s
taff is trained annually in emergency procedures and has practice drills on a regular basis. The school nurse offers 
CPR/first
-
aid classes on a regular basis.  The staff was trained on specific practices at the beginning of the school
-
year.  The 
school is 
equipped with surveillance cameras and was recently re
-
keyed to strengthen safety practice. The parking lot, as 
well as the playground, can be observed through this video system.

The Happy Valley Union Elementary School District provides ongoing professional development opportunities. We have 
two full days dedicated to district
-
wide professional development as well as utilizing our minimum day Monday schedule 
for one hour of profes
sional development each week.  The major emphasis of our staff development is in the area of 
Common Core State Standards, Response to Intervention (RTI), utilizing instructional technologies, targeted instruction, 
and student engagement strategies. Our foc
us is to improve student achievement using data, developing individual plans 
to support student learning, and monitoring student progress. Our district is committed to staff development. In addition 
to three staff development days, we utilize teacher relea
se time, school workshops, and conferences to support ongoing 
learning. Teachers are supported in their professional development by participating in Differentiated Assistance, literacy 
training, trauma
-
informed practices, social and emotional learning and 
a vertical collaboration process. We are developing 
a system that uses improvement science to facilitate continuous improvement in literacy across the content areas and 
social and emotional learning.  Our LCAP reflects this process in goals one and two.
