About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees
 
has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bond to rep
air, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. A lunch shade 
structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added, student classroom furniture was replaced, ext
erior painting was completed and perimeter 
fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at Abbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bayside 
Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City. George Hall Elementary is part of Phase II in which ad
ditional 
classrooms and a Multi
-
Purpose Room will be added to the school.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in Novembe
r 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis to 
assist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box"
 
is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs a
re given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner, the maintenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed w
ith at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal
, along with the ma
intenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows t

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility s
urvey instrument developed by the State of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site.

School Safety Plan
 
The San Mateo
-

aimed at 
creating a safe and caring 
school community where all students and families feel welcomed, valued and respected. These Guiding Principles (respect, 
responsibility, appreciation of differences, honesty, safety and life
-
long learning) communicate the expectations for behavior to stude
nts, parents, 
teachers and administrators and are updated and reviewed yearly. The rules were developed to be consistent with State Educati
on Code, policies of the 
San Mateo
-
Foster City School District Board of Trustees and the School District's Strategic 
Plan.
 
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plans, developed individually for each school in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of 
Education and City 
Services, include disaster preparedness and emergency procedures. The School Safety Plans provide role re
sponsibility guidelines and processes required 
to address major emergencies. Annually, the District utilizes the services of School Innovations & Achievement to review each
 

determine if all required components are included and to of
fer feedback and suggestions.
 
 
California Education Code Section 32280 requires school fire evacuation drills, as well as one law enforcement lockdown drill
, and the District organizes 
two District
-
wide drills each year, using different scenarios that test
 
the Big Five Safety Protocols (Shelter in Place, Secure Campus, Drop, Cover and Hold 
On, Lockdown/Barricade and Evacuation). These drills involve a District Command Center for communication with each school/pro
gram site and full 
emergency set
-
up. As a Dis
trict collaborating with San Mateo County and the San Mateo County Office of Education, we participate yearly in Big Five 
training for staff.

The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development 
opportunities for all staff. Training is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release
 
days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is a
ligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities
 
integrate content 
development and researc
h
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the resear
ch from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
anguage and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development
 
on the California Standards and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learni
ng communities withi
n and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site l
eaders developed professional learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and fe
edback surveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions
. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strategies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leade
rship meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for stud
ent successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then infor

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their pro
fessional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union repr
esentatives to elicit their 
feedback on the distric
t professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the district LCAP. Additionally
, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on thei
r experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teac
hers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
