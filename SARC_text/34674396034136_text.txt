School Description
 
Mark Twain aims to create an environment where children come first and where students will 
develop the academic and social skills necessary to not only meet grade level standards
, but to 
bring them to a place where they become passionate life
-
long learners.
 
 
The success of our students is fostered by:
 

 
Providing a safe and positive environment that values cultural and ethnic diversity.
 

 
Empowering families with meaningful o

education.
 
To promote and enhance positive traits in everyone, the school has implemented a school wide 
focus on the following traits: respect, responsibility, teamwork/cooperation, giving and service, 
initiativ
e, caring, trustworthiness, justice and fairness, perseverance, and acceptance. Each month 
emphasis is given to one of these traits.
 
 
The Mark Twain staff recognizes students for positive contributions, good attendance, academic 
progress, and good citizens
hip through various incentives and monthly assemblies. 
 
 
To support struggling students, the following structures are in place: Student Success Team, 
individualized intervention for students during the school day, tutoring, and differentiated 
instruction i
n the classroom with assistance from classroom aides and peer tutors from Hiram 
Johnson West Campus High School. 
 
 
The Target Excellence Program provides academic support with a safe, positive learning 
environment, and increases attendance during the schoo
l day. The academic program component 
includes homework assistance, and a variety of enrichment and recreational activities.The 
program's primary goal is to provide additional student skill development with the following areas: 
education, health and wellne
ss, fitness, and social and life skills. 
 
 
Mark Twain also houses two preschool programs (State Preschool and Head Start Preschool)

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

-
20)
 
The district instructional material evaluation committee, cons
isted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted cour
ses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
R
ecommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committ
ee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some in
stances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

om its most recent facility 
inspection in September 2018.  The district gove
rning Board has adopted cleanliness standards for all district schools to ensure that all schools are clean, 
safe and functional.  The district Operations Department takes great pride following a work order process that provides effic
ient and timely servic
es to 
all the sites.  The principal works directly with the site custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure that the s
chool is clean and safe.
 
 

nding to all district schools.  The district performed 
Quick Strike projects during the summer of 2014, which allowed schools to pick from one of the following improvements: 1) mar
quees, 2) closed
-
circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior paintin
g, or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district schools 
were upgraded.  Additional 10 million dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to beg
in in 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smart
er 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is 
imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including
 
ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through thi
s program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson
 
design.

Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunit
y for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of 
responsibility.
