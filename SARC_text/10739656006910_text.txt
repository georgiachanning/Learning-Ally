About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repai
r, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student,
 
including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class se
ts, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitm
ent of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are 
selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees 
and Educational Services.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Madison Elementary sits on 17.5 acres. It is comprised of 24 permanent classrooms, 16 portable classrooms, an office building
, and a cafeteria multi
-
purpose building. Madison was built in 1954 and refurbished in 1985
. The table below shows the results of the school's most recent inspection using the 
Facility Inspection Tool (FIT).  This inspection determines the school facility's good repair status. District maintenance st
aff ensures that repairs necessary 
to keep the
 
school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner.  For all items inspected that were found to not be in
 
'good repair', 
work orders have been created and maintenance will be done before the end of the 2019
-
20 school year.  Maintenance
 
items will be prioritized so that 
student safety is not compromised.  The overall rating for this school is 'fair'.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madison's parents are
 
provided with numerous opportunities to participate in all aspects of school governance. The school is proud of the support a
nd 
assistance offered by the Madison Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA). This group of parents has traditionally provided funding fo
r field trips, classroom 
resources, and student incentives. Madison's PTA puts on multiple community events each year such as Trunk
-
or
-
Treat, Muffins with Mom, Donuts with 
Dad, and Breakfast with Santa. The School Site Council (SSC) consists of a group of 
dedicated, well
-
informed parents/guardians whose input is 
instrumental in setting priorities in our annual categorical budgets. We also have an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELA
C) who represents our 
English Learner students. The Madison ELAC provides
 
valuable input regarding the perspective and needs of our English Learner parent and student 
population. Madison also provides parenting classes such as Family Literacy Nights and Math Nights. These classes provide par
enting skills and support 
in both Eng
lish and Spanish to parents. Parents are encouraged to volunteer on campus in a variety of ways. Translation and interpretati
on services are 
provided.

School Safety Plan
 
School safety is a high priority at Madison. Two
-
wa
y radios and surveillance cameras have been provided. All staff personnel and students take pride and 
share in the responsibility of keeping the campus clean. There are administrators and teachers on duty during morning bus arr
ival and afternoon pick
-
up. A
dministrators, teachers, and aides monitor the playground during all recesses. The Site Emergency Response Plan is reviewed a
nd updated annually 
by the administration, with input from teachers, parents, and students. It is further discussed and reviewed wi
th the district's School Safety Officer. The 
updated Site Emergency Response Plan is presented to the School Site Council which serves the role of the School Safety Commi
ttee. After School Site 
Council approval, the plan is shared with the whole staff. All
 
classrooms have posted fire escape exit routes, and school
-
wide drills are scheduled routinely: 
monthly for fire drills and quarterly for lockdown and disaster/earthquake. This ensures that all students are familiar with 
the correct procedures in case 
of 
a real emergency. The emergency plan was updated, SSC approved, and shared with the staff on November 21, 2019.

Professional 
development is an on
-
going process at Madison, both for administrators and teachers. Madison teachers receive training in strategies to 
support English Learners which provided instructional expertise in implementing the core adoption while delivering quali
ty instruction to our English 
Learner students. Madison utilizes the biweekly minimum day for additional staff development on topics that are aligned to th
e district's instructional 
department and facilitated by the principal.
 
 
Our professional development
 
this year is focused primarily on three areas. First is supporting teachers in effective instructional practices to implement
 
the Common Core standards. The second area of focus is on becoming more familiar with integrating technology into curriculum 
desi
gn. Teachers are 
supported in the use of technology as an educational tool within the classroom.  Another area of focus is on Professional Lea
rning Communities (PLCs) 
which provide time for teachers to collaborate with their grade level, analyze assessment
 
results, identify curricular areas that need re
-
teaching, and 
share of effective instructional strategies to address certain standards within the content areas that need improvement. Dist
rict Instructional Support 
Coaches and administration provide model 
lessons on the above strategies to teachers.
