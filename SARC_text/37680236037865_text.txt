Description
 
Halecrest
 
School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including 
charters. The school was built in 1961 and consists of self
-
contained classrooms, a resource room, 
a library, and a multipurpose cafeteria.
 
 
Halecrest Elementary is an am
azing school that invests in "growing" respectful and responsible 
young adults. Student progress in social emotional categories and character development is equally 
important as academics at Halecrest.   Halecrest has always believed in developing the whol
e child.   
Students are recognized monthly, during a school
-
wide assembly, for embodying the strengths 
which promote good citizenship and character. Beyond the school day, students have many 
opportunities for extra curricular enrichment: Sing n' Speak Span
ish, Robotics Club, Heartlight 
Dance, Academic Chess, 21 different field trip opportunities, DASH, Extended Day Program, Mad 
Science, Christian Youth Theater (CYT),  basketball, soccer, flag football, Mileage Running Club, 
Safety Patrol, and Student Counci
l.  Halecrest has Curriculum Night,  Fall Festival, a Multi
-
Cultural 
Fair, Literacy Week, family movie nights, Folk Dance Festival, and many other fun events.  Halecrest 
continues to support year
-
round visual and performing art classes.  Student, parent, a
nd 
community involvement is a priority at Halecrest.  We hold parent Workshops throughout the year.
 
 
The school's site plan goals are focused on improving the proficiency rate of English Language Arts 
and Math California Standards Tests as well as an incre
ase in the proficiency of the district Local 
Measures Reading, Math, and Writing assessments. We also have goals specifically for our English 
Learners, Special Education, and Socio Economically Disadvantaged target populations.
 
 
Mission
 
Halecrest is commit
ted to a balanced educational program that promotes the development of each 
student's full potential. Our children are self
-
reliant, confident, and literate. We are eager learners 
who effectively process, analyze, and assess information. We also encourage 
problem solving, 
responsible decision
-
making, and a lifelong love of learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

We have Parent Training Nights to keep parents informed about assessment, curriculum and instruction and we provide parents w
ith ways in which they 
can become partners with us in the education of their children.
 
 
Halecrest is 
proud of the high level of parent interest and involvement in the school.  An active Parent

Six Halecrest parents are members of the School Site Council and take part in planning school activities a
nd programs.  Parents are also members of the 
English Language Advisory Committee, which examines and provides input into the educational program provided for English Lang
uage Learners.
 
 
Parent Coffees with the Principal are held monthly to open
