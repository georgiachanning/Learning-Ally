(CAASPP)The California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System includes 
the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general education 

population, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for students with the most significant 

cognitive disabilities.  Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.  

CAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common 

Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering 

California™s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to 

grades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/

Literacy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test 

items are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core 

State Standards (CCSS). 
The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and 
state scores as well as the school™s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown 

only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank 

in the tables, no students met subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP can be found on the 

California Department of Education™s website www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/.
