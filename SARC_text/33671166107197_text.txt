By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate
 
in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who
 
have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee 
Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the MVMS Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures
 
for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill
, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our 
professional development strategy is geared to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state an
d local assessments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additi
onally, the major areas of focus have been on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed p
er site and data. Additional days are provided before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going pr
ofessional growth. Many teachers and administrators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
