By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Magnolia Intermediate School is located in the Lake of the Pines area between the communities of Grass Valley and 
Auburn. It is one of four schools in the Pleasant Ridge
 
Union School District. Magnolia Intermediate has an enrollment of 
387, serving students in grades six through eight.  Zachary Pless is the Magnolia Principal and Rusty Clark is the 
Superintendent of the Pleasant Ridge Union Elementary School District. The
 
school enjoys a stable and active community 
that supports the many and varied programs available for our students. Magnolia Intermediate School was recognized in 
1988, 2001 and again in 2009 as a California Distinguished School, an honor earned by the dis


 
 
The educational needs of all children are recognized as extremely important.  An accelerated math track is available for 
students w
ho qualify.  Teachers in other core curriculum areas differentiate instruction to address the needs and ability 
level of their students.  In addition to the general education program, the special education program has been specifically 
designed to meet the
 
needs of all special needs students through the collaborative educational expertise and specialized 
talents of our resource specialist designated instructional services, speech/language, and adaptive PE teachers and other 
necessary specialists.  Magnolia 
has a diverse elective program that includes a vibrant performing arts program, bands, 
choir, and theater arts.   Most seventh grade students take a College/Career Exploration class.  The elective program 
includes Spanish, woodworking, art, photography, le
adership, coding & robotics, and advanced computer skills and video 
production.
 
 
An important element of the overall school program is the co
-
curricular and extracurricular activities that encourage and 
supports the involvement of more than fifty percent o
f the student body.  In addition to the co
-
curricular components of 
the electives noted above, many students participated in interscholastic sports: volleyball, basketball, cross country, and 
track.  Students are involved in countywide academic tournaments
 
and the district's Odyssey of the Mind (OotM) program.  
In 2019
-
20 the school added a Wrestling club, a Leo service club in partnership with the local Lions club, chess club, and 
an E
-
Sports team.
 
 
Recognizing the need for additional time for students who
 
may be falling behind or for students that have demanding 
extra
-
curricular schedules, we offer a lunch study hall available on a drop
-
in basis or as a mandatory assignment for make
-
up work two days per week. Magnolia's academic intervention programs are m
ulti
-
faceted.  Students deficient in basic 
skills are assigned to Academic Workshop classes designed to improve those skills.  An opportunity center pulls students 
who are struggling to offer supports and goal
-
setting interventions.  Many teachers are avai
lable before or after school 
and during the lunch period to assist students.  The school also offers a self
-
contained classroom (SOAR
-
 
Success through 
Ownership, Achievement, and Responsibility) for students who need support in motivation and behavior.
 
 
Th
ere is a continued emphasis and focus on providing a successful academic and social environment for all students 
utilizing the most attainable technology, innovative teaching strategies, and specific skills. The Rattler PIT and Den house 

chnology labs. The labs are designed by teachers to be used for integrating technology with the daily 
curriculum. Magnolia also has a mobile iPad (30) lab and 300 Chromebooks that are utilized daily to access digitized 
curricula. There are 105 Intel
-
based 
Macintosh iMac computers making it possible to teach three separate classes or 
accommodate three classes working on the same project. It is a project
-
based lab, meaning that teachers do not have 
assigned times, but sign up by projects.

Each year all sixth
-
grade students participate in a week
-
long science camp. This program provides the students in our 
community with an opportunity to gain an understanding of the relationships between man and his natural environment. 
Located in Sonoma County, Magnolia stude
nts work with the University of California students at the UC Marine Biology 
Laboratory in Bodega Bay studying tide pool life, visiting Armstrong Redwoods State Park and participating in 
environmental study activities at Alliance Redwoods Camp.
 
 
Magnolia I
ntermediate School is a Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) school. The School
-
Wide Positive 
Behavioral Interventions and Supports program is a systemic method for developing and supporting social competence 
and academic achievement.  All student
s meet once a week in small groups to focus on social
-
emotional learning using 
videos, journaling, and restorative circles to facilitate this learning.
 
 
Mission Statement:   Encourage, Engage, and Educate
 
 
Vision Statement:  Magnolia provides a safe and 
engaging environment where students develop academic, social and life 
skills to become productive, responsible citizens in a constantly changing global society.

State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
