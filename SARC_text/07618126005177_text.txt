By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 23, 2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current 
standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a part of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editions for teaching language arts 
(reading, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathe
matics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
language texts are 
also up
-
to
-
date. Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, s
tandards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Frameworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We have an abundance of supplementary reading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elemen
tary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leveled reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narrative as well as expository text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing
 
on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities
 
The Indian Valley School facility houses 20 classrooms, a library media center, science room, art room, resource room, 
counseling and speech room, and large multi purpose room. The Indian Valley site has 
Mount Diablo, and its open space 

renovated 18 years ago. The facility is safe, structurally sound and designed to support student learning
. Outdoor learning 
areas provide beautiful, picturesque places for students, staff and parents to gather to extend learning outdoors.

Students are expected  to arrive at school not before 7:45 a.m.; students who arrive at school before this time are 
seated 
in our office hallway where we can observe and supervise as needed. At 7:50 a.m., students are dismissed to go out to the 
playground where two teachers are on duty to supervise and maintain student safety. Classroom teachers pick up their 
students f
rom the playground at the end of each recess. Students are under adult supervision during the school day, 
whether on the playground, in the cafeteria or classrooms, during lunch, recess or class time. These adults are either 
credentialed teachers or noon s
upervisors who have received training in school safety and school rules. Supervisors meet 
with the principal on a regular basis to continue training and to deal with issues that may occur. We also have a number 
of parent volunteers who are also on campus a
nd provide additional support to district staff.
 
 
After school, students are sent to the front of the school to wait for their parents. There are two staff members and our 
student safety patrol who supervise the parking lot and student pickup. Often, the p
rincipal is also out front providing 
additional support. If students are not picked up when the teachers finish their parking
-
lot duty, students are seated in 
the office hallway while we make a call to parents to check on their arrival or if the student is
 
expected to attend the after 
school daycare program.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District renovated an area that provides a well
-
groomed grass field for student athletic use. 
Students work in well
-
lit, heated and cooled classrooms. The entire site is well ma
intained to provide a positive teaching 
and learning environment. Every classroom has a telephone with access to an outside line, internet access, a document 
camera and projector. Approximately 1/2 of the classrooms have upgraded to large TV monitor screen
s in lieu of the LCD 
projector. All classrooms have multiple student devices, and we have five mobile Chromebook carts for 1:1 student 
computing. Furnishings are in good repair. The library provides 28 computers for daily student use. The library houses 
ap
proximately 14,000 books, including a variety of technological reference materials.
 
 
Two site custodians and district maintenance staff keep the classrooms, common areas and grounds clean and in excellent 
repair. All student toilets and restrooms, as well 
as the four adult restrooms, have been remodeled to ensure excellent 
repair and working order.
 
 
All restrooms are cleaned daily. Custodial staff is on duty from early morning to evening Monday through Friday to clean 
the entire facility. The on

re facility has its own cleaning staff. The day care is in good repair and uses the 

 
 
In 2009, the district renovated the playground and sports field using Measure C bond funds. New turf coveri
ng the play 
surface around the play structures was installed summer 2018. The district upgraded the soccer and baseball fields by 
planting new turf and installing an irrigation system. In 2010, our kitchen was totally renovated.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

All professional growth is determined by both school site and district strategic planning process, which is ongoing 
throughout the school 
year and culminates with an update in the spring of each year. Planning teams include all school 
and community stakeholders, and the work is based on site
-
needs assessments. Input from all school and community 
stakeholders is collected during the planning 
process and is used to develop the district Local Control and Accountability 
Plan (LCAP).
 
 
For 2019
-
2020, the district focus will be on the implementation of the recently adopted math programs at both the K
-
5 
and 6
-
8 levels, and there will be an 

identifying the implementation of Common Core State Standards for professional growth in the district LCAP, other areas 
for professional development identified in the district
 
LCAP are: Technology Integration, English Language Development 
(ELD) instructional strategies and Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) training.
 
 

As each school 
identifies goals for supporting the district focus, staff members meet by grade level or departments to study student 
assessment data or student behaviors and determine how to improve instruction through research and effective 
pedagogy. Week
ly collaboration time is provided for all TK
-
8 teachers. Instructional coaches provide individual student
-
centered coaching cycles and participate in grade
-
level and department meetings to support professional growth.
 
 
Individual teachers and administrator
s keep their skills current by researching about learning, attending workshops and 
classes and reading on their own. Some examples are attendance at various conferences: Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, ISTE, PBL World, SVMI, Middle School Con
ference, Socratic Seminar, Reading Recovery, and technology. 
Teachers attend training sessions in differentiated instruction, special education, Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) and in all core curricular areas. Beginning teachers participate in a 
two
-
year induction program with a mentor who 
is trained through the Contra Costa County Office of Education Teacher Induction Program.
 
 
We continue to provide four days each school year that are dedicated to staff and professional development. The district
 
ensures the agendas for these professional growth days are tied to areas defined by the strategic plan and LCAP.
