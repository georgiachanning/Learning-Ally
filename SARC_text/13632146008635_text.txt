By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of San Pasqual Valley Elementary School. Visitors are required to sign in 
at the school office and obtain a visitor's pass upon arrival and required to return to the school office upon departure. 
During lun
ch, recesses, and before and after school, staff members supervise students and school grounds, including the 
cafeteria and playgrounds, to ensure a safe and orderly environment. The comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed 
by the district to comply wi
th Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 
within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, 
routine and emergency; policies related to
 
suspension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; 
provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly 
school environment; and school rules and procedures. Th
e school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed.
 
 
Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and district staff in the fall, at th
e 
start of each school year. The plan was last updated and reviewed
 
with school staff in December 2019.
