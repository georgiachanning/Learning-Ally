By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Accountability Report Card was established by Prop
osition 98, an initiative passed by California voters. As you 
read the Report Card, you will gain a better understanding of Evergreen as a school with a record for improvement, a 
faculty that is professionally committed to meeting the learning needs of stu
dents and a student body which is enthusiastic 
and motivated to perform well.
 
 
Evergreen Elementary School opened its doors in August 1997. It is located in southwest Bakersfield and serves students 
and families in 
 
 
prekindergarten through fifth grade; in
cluding specialized instruction for English learners and students who receive special 


-
curri
cular activities, including music, student government, oral language, 
academic pentathlon, spelling bee, and Battle of the Books. Fifth grade students visit CSUB and UCLA and fourth grade 
students visit one of the VT Ranch. Students in other grade levels m
ay attend fieldtrips as determined by their teachers. 
As part of our Common Core State Standards implementation, students in all grade levels complete a project each year, 
which allows them to apply what they have learned in a personal, creative manner. Al
l Evergreen classrooms are equipped 
with Smart technology, which includes smart boards, document cameras, microphones and LCD projectors. Students, staff 
and families have access to a Chromebooks and the library. Several incentive programs are implemented 
to promote 
attendance, academic achievement and desired positive behavior. Fifth grade boys and girls have the opportunity to be 
nominated as candidates to receive the Juliet Thorner Award, the O. D. Williams Award and the Fred Haynes Award. 
Evergreen impl
ements a Positive School
-
wide Behavior Intervention and Support Framework (PBIS) to promote a positive 
engaging environment, with an emphasis on positive behavior and relationships. Through PBIS, students see models of 
and are rewarded for positive behavio
r. Students learn how to set goals and monitor progress toward those goals. Success 
is celebrated. Evergreen offers an extended day for students in grades 1
-
5, through an after school program which is 

o is "College bound citizens soaring to success." We strive to provide 
a safe, positive and rigorous learning environment that holds students, staff, and families to high standards for learning 
and behavior.
 
 
Beliefs:
 

 
All students are held to high academic
 
expectations.
 

 
Students will learn at higher levels if they are engaged in and actively participate in the learning.
 

 
Accountability for academic achievement rests with all stake holders; staff, students, families and the 
community.
 

 
Parents play an integral
 
part in the success of their children and Evergreen School.
 

 
Varied instructional approaches will best meet the needs of different learners.
 

 
Character development and citizenship play an important role in the learning process and the learning 
environment.
 

 
The ideas and input of all stake holders is valuable and plays a crucial role in the success of the school.
 

 
The school, as a community of learners, will provide educational opportunities that will challenge all students 
and promote the pursuit
 
of lifelong learning.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training opportunities affirm the basic 
philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruction and student learning.
 
 
All 
training revolves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, the Common Core 
State Standards
, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning Communities through our Service 
Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and resources for collaboration, 
planni
ng, and professional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received four days of professional development prior to the begi
nning of the school year 
focused on orientation to District and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up the classroom. Teachers in their second year with 
t
he District received two days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
site and focused on improving best practices.
 
 
New teachers with California preliminary credentials received professional development
 
through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California Induc
tion 
standards. The culmination of TIP is the recommendation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
veteran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional development in 
coaching/mentoring strategies, instr
uctional strategies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthly meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional development at monthly meetings focusing on the ini
tial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day
-
to
-
day support in these areas as well as 
advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern Progr
am.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Credential
. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provided a we
ekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners t
o ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
