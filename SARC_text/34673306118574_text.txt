By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 


on student success for college and career readiness. A focus on building interdependent relations amongst staff and 
students to promote lifelong self
-
efficacy through an emph
asis on culture, climate, coherence and maximizing student 
engagement will help build a school where students and staff grow and learn together. A collective focus on student 
engagement and learning, where every child is known by name, ensures that every s
tudent will have the tools to reach 
their full academic potential.
 
 
Empire Oaks embraces the Folsom Cordova Unified Districts vision statement which states:
 
Guided by the highest expectations, Empire Oaks and the Folsom Cordova Unified School District pro
vides our students 
with a broad range of rigorous educational opportunities.  Staff enables students to reach their full potential and 
successfully meet the demands and opportunities of a highly technological 21st Century.
 
 
By focusing on the foundational 
school years through grades kindergarten through fifth, Empire Oaks Elementary will start 
students on the path so that they can eventually graduate with a core of knowledge and skills that become the building 
blocks for lifelong learning.  They graduate wi
th a positive attitude and the leadership, character, and academic skills 
necessary to excel in a global arena.
 
 
Families are an integral part of the educational process.  In recognition of this important role, at Empire Oaks family 
involvement is actively
 
sought, encouraged, and welcomed.
 
 
Business and community partnerships greatly enhance students' learning experiences and educational opportunities.  
Partnerships offer students opportunities to apply their learning to real
-
world situations. At Empire Oak
s, the 
administration and staff actively seek community partnerships in order to enhance and amplify students' educational 
experiences.
 
 
Schools serve as community hubs, places where the community gathers to celebrate and improve learning and to enjoy 
art, music, sports, public speaking, drama, and other school
-
related activities.  The use of school facilities by the 
community at Empire Oaks is encouraged.
 
 
School facilities are a reflection of the entire community.  We provide students with the educati
onal tools to meet the 
technological demands of the future and the social skills to function in a culturally diverse society.

receive The Blue Ribbon Award. Nestled against the foothills of El Dorado, the homes of the Empire Ranch community 
surround the campus. Hazel McFarland Park is adjacent to the campus and serves as a wonderful area for families to meet 
and pl

trimesters of instruction for our students. The staff is made up of educators who hold California Teaching Credentials and 
paraprofessionals who support our students and staff.
 
 
The c
ampus is made up of four classroom buildings, a library and a multipurpose room, surrounding the Administration 
building. The students are engaged in instruction as you enter each classroom. Everyone on campus has a sense of pride 
in our learning community
. Parents are an important part of the daily classroom routine. Whether it is working with a 
small group, one

-
one, or assisting with procedures, volunteers are visible on a daily basis. Parent volunteers are also 
helping in our library and are docents f
or our Meet the Masters program. Many students attend the before and after 
school Student Care Center located on campus.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and School Site Council (SSC) are actively involved in our school program. Our PTA 
Board plans nu
merous activities and events which enhance the positive bond between parents, teachers, and students. 
The PTA provides financial support through fundraising that supplements school wide curriculum, consistently supporting 
Science Technology Engineering Art

an effort to support our core curriculum. The school has 1:1 chromebooks in the classroom to enhance technological 
access and proficiency of use. Each classroom is equipp

Our school is structured around high academic and behavioral expectations, w
hich help maintain a positive school
-
wide 
atmosphere.  Our staff believes that all students have the ability to learn and are committed to providing conditions that 
promote student success. This success is accomplished through the use of clear expectations
 
that are directly taught 
throughout the school year. Students are recognized through verbal and written feedback for appropriate behavior. The 
entire staff believes that "all students means all students" and share in the collective responsibility of provi
ding an 
atmosphere where every student can meet their educational goals.
 
 
At Empire Oaks we believe that all students can learn and that we, working in partnership with families, can facilitate 
learning to ensure that our students will achieve to their gre

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Empire Oaks Elementary 
School is a beautiful facility that opened in August 2001, with spacious classrooms that provide 
ample room for student learning activities. Students spend recesses on the large playground playing interactive games 
that support their physical as well as so
cial emotional needs. They also enjoy recreational activities such as soccer and 
football on the green field. Two areas equipped with primary and intermediate play structures are available for play. A 
staff lounge, workroom and conference room are located 
in the administration building for teacher and support staff use. 
There is a well maintained outdoor patio for staff use.  Restrooms are bright and clean. The floors and walls are in excellen
t 
condition. All plumbing, electrical, fire, security and communi
cations systems are fully working and up to date.  The facility 
was designed to provide the best possible learning environment with modern and efficient lighting, heating and cooling 
systems, fire alarm system, and technology infrastructure.
 
 
Our custodial
 
staff proudly works to keep the buildings and grounds looking like new. A communication log for facility 
concerns is provided for staff input and addresses the areas of safety, supplies, and maintenance issues. Should a safety 
hazard be reported, repairs 
are quickly made by our custodian, or a work order is submitted. The students, parents and 
staff members have worked together to plant flowers and keep the park
-
like landscaping tidy and are proud of our 
beautiful, well
-
maintained campus.

less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or 
not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement, support, and interaction at Empire Oaks is amazing! Hundreds of volunteers spend time on a daily 
basis working in classrooms, the library, ch
aperoning field trips, and helping with the various class room activities. Parent 
docents provide support for the Meet the Masters, an art program, for students in each class. Parent volunteers serve on 
important school committees:  Superintendent's Commun
ication Committee, School Site Council, Gifted Education (GATE) 
Advisory, and Parent District Advisory Council. Our PTA has a very active membership that nearly equals our student 
enrollment.  Several events have become annual traditions, such as our Fall 
Festival, Snowflake Festival, Family Bingo 
Night, Gaming Gala, and other family
-
oriented activities where students, staff and families enjoy games, socialize and have 
fun. Empire Oaks also hosts several opportunities for family engagement around academics,
 
like STEM Night, Math Game 
Night, Literacy Night, etc. Fundraising and educational activities that enrich student learning are also priorities for our P
TA. 
Every General PTA Meeting is preceded by a Family Partnership Meeting, called "What's Perkin' with 
Parenzin," an 
opportunity to engage with Principal Parenzin; hear updates, ask questions, and offer suggestions. Topics are based on 
needs reflected in parent survey responses and range from state of the school type addresses, to social emotional learning,
 
Internet safety, school culture, and safety.
 
 
Parent involvement is a valuable and important component of the success of our school programs. Our volunteers reflect 
the excellent partnership between home and school which enhances and enriches the educatio
nal opportunities for our 
students.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school is safe and clean. There were seven (7) student accidents reported at our school in the 2018
-
19 school year. 
Restrooms and eating facilities are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned on a regular basis 
and safety hazards are 
reported and reviewed immediately and resolved. Safety plans are practiced regularly.  Emergency plans have been 
developed in case a threatening situation should arise.
 
 
The safety of our students and staff is always our first priori
ty. Our classrooms and playgrounds are monitored to ensure 
that all safety requirements are met. Safety procedures are modeled and taught to all students. Each classroom has crisis 
information with evacuation procedures, maps and crisis protocol. These pro
cedures are reviewed throughout the year 
when fire and safety drills are held. It is required that all visitors check into the office before entering the campus. Each
 
volunteer is furnished with a picture identification badge that is worn while on campus.
 
 
Empire Oaks is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions which contribute to 
the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements:
 
 
1.
 
School Crime Assessment: Empire Oaks 
provides compiled school crime information for the California Safe School 
Assessment as mandated by the State of California. This information as it relates to the school site is analyzed at 
the school site to determine what steps may be taken to reduce inc
idents of crime.
 
 
2.
 
Child Abuse Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected 
child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any 
follow
-
up on the report is necessary.
 
 
3.
 
Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school district along with 
our school safety committee has created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness Plan called Hour Zer
o.  
Emergency drills are held regularly and evaluated for effectiveness.

4.
 
School Discipline: Empire Oaks has created a school wide discipline plan in order to communicate high standards 
and expectations and to hold students accountable for their behavio
r. The discipline plan is given to every student 
and reviewed in a classroom presentation. Staff members consistently enforce the school wide standards.
 
 
5.
 
Procedure to Notify Teachers of Dangerous Pupils: If a student is deemed dangerous because of behav
ior at school 
or behavior outside of school which has been dealt with by county juvenile authorities, the teacher of the student 
will be promptly notified of the status of the student.
 
 
6.
 
Sexual Harassment Policy: Empire Oaks strictly adheres to district 
policies which prohibit sexual harassment or 
discrimination of any kind. The sexual harassment policy is distributed to each student at the beginning of the 
school year, and employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware of 
any incidents 
of sexual harassment.
 
 
7.
 
Schoolwide Dress Code: Empire Oaks believes that a clearly defined dress code contributes to a positive school 
environment. The primary standards for student dress and grooming are as follows: the student should be n
eat 
and clean; the student should wear clothing that does not compromise safety or modesty or that is disruptive to 
the educational process.
 
 
8.
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Empire Oaks believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a 
posi
tive learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, administrators, campus supervisors and parent volunteers 
consistently supervise and interact with s
tudents to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
