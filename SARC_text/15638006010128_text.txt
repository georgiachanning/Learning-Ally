About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Jefferson School was built in 1985. The adjacent Library Media Center, which is 6,600 square feet, was built in 2005 and paid
 
for with local bond funds.
 
 
Overall, the school site is in good working order and maintain
ed regularly by one full

Students are kept safe by having all visitors check in and out at the office. The playground gates are kept locked. The only 
people allowed to pick children 
up from 
school through the office must be on the emergency card of the student.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Bal
anced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible studen
ts 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Asse
ssment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

School Safety Plan
 
Jefferson strives to have a safe and nurturing environment for our students. The staff monitors the school grounds for 15 min
utes before school,

is on campus at all times when students are present.  Staff is strategically located in order to ensure that all areas have a
dequate coverage . The sc
hool 
staff reviews the drills yearly prior to the beginning of the school year and drills are practiced throughout the year.
 
 
Jefferson is part of the Taft City School District that has a comprehensive safety plan.
