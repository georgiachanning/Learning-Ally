annually and provides parents 
and other interested people with a variety of information about the school, its resources, its 
successes, and the areas in which improvements are needed.
 
 
If you wish to participate in organized opportunities for parent involv
ement or wish to gain

About th
e SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional informat
ion about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Oceano Elementary 
School provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Built in 1951 and modernized within the last 15 years, Oceano Element
ary 
School is situated on 12.5 acres. The school buildings span 36,884 square feet and consist of 28 classrooms, a library, compu
te
r lab, administrative offices, 
a large multipurpose room and Special Education classes operated by the County Office of Education. A new library, the new Ad
ult Education Office and 
two new preschool classrooms and playgrounds were all recently completed. T
he facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample 
classroom and playground space.
 
 
A complete Utilities Replacement was completed over the Summer of 2017.  The addition of 12 new classrooms and a restroom mod
ule to replace 11 
existing c
lassrooms currently housed in portable buildings is planned for the Summer of 2018 (completion set for February 2019).
 
 
Oceano Elementary School is a closed campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in sc
hool events
. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to check
-

office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults su
pervise students and school grounds, such as the cafeteria and 
recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and cond
uct insp
ections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely m
anner. A work
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest 
priority. The District maintenance staff has indicated that 100 percent 
of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
A team of custodians ensures classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept clean and safe. A scheduled maintenance progr
am 
is administered 
by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide a suitable 
learning environment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly 
learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their Safe School Plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies r
elated to suspensio
n and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress 
of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school e
valuates the plan annually and updates it as needed. The plan is reviewed and updated by the Oceano School Site Council each 
fall.  Safety 
procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District staff in the fall, at t
he start of each school year. All school 
staff received monthly safety information to review.  All mandated drills are executed per required time lines.

Career Technical Education Progra
ms
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing 
workforce technology and employment environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students grad
uating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessar
y for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as 
Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, trade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school, college and te
chnical training 
environments. This resulted in the need
 
to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engages participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opportunities within a specific industry sector. High Scho
ol Career Pathway
s provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario. 
 
 
Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one industry certification, or equivalent s
kill measurement, to provide 
a comp
etitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate and ass
ociate degree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and in some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework 
while still in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Education 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan f
or Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the State Board of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of career pathway programs of study 
for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of p
athway preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with industry members an
d assembling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewing and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determ
ining outreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs.

The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway programs, and site administration in the areas of curricu
lum, facility and equi
pment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by attending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additi
onally, CTE instructors focus on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affect
s the structural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has co
ntinued to improve annually in the support of current programs that are functioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from programs that currently function as a single co
urse, and establish new 
program
s where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions through the Futu
re Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culin
ary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had regional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Industry recognized certifications include CPR, First Aid
, Food Handlers, Se
rv Safe, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and som
e pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Additionally, students are able to build resumes and portfolios with unique 
projects that demonstrate their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are a
ble to gain real world 
experience within their field of study that often times l
eads to employment.
