School Description
 
Mission Statement: The mission of Hollywood Park Elementary School is to provide rigorous 
instructional practices, promote parent and community engagement, and maintain a positive 
school culture and climate.
 
 
* Rigorous Instructional Practices: In order fo
r our students to be college and career ready, we 
provide rigorous instructional practices.  All teachers are GATE Certified and differentiate their 
instruction to meet the needs of all students.  Teachers implement the California Common Core 
State Standar
ds (CCCSS) and provide challenging instruction using technology that utilizes 
conceptual & higher
-
order thinking activities.  Teachers plan and implement engaging lessons that 
provide students with opportunities to work collaboratively.
 
 
* Parent and Commu
nity Engagement: With parents as our partners, we support student 
achievement. Our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) encourages parent involvement and provides 
enrichment opportunities for our students and their families, as well as organizes family events
 
that 
enhance the school community. In addition to the PTO, our English Language Advisory Committee 
(ELAC) meets regularly to provide input regarding services that meet the needs of our bilingual 
students.
 
 
* School Culture and Climate: Through the 
implicit instruction of Character Education (Word of the 
Week and the Second Step curriculum) and Social Emotional Learning (SEL), students learn the 
importance of respect and responsibility.  SEL provides students opportunities to explore self
-
awareness, 
social awareness, responsible decision
-
making, relationship skills, and self
-
management.  The PTO supports the creation of a positive learning environment through 
assemblies, social events, campus beautification, and parent engagement opportunities.  Calif
ornia 
State University Sacramento (CSUS) partners with HPE to provide relevant, meaningful, and 
interactive SEL lessons each week.
 
 
Our mission will be achieved through CCSS
-
aligned curriculum & instruction that enables all 
students to meet their learning 
objectives, ensures that all teaching is effective and meets the 
individual needs of all students, empowers students to take ownership of their learning, creates a 
positive learning environment where everyone feels that they are stakeholders in the school 
community, and by involving parents in their children's education through open, ongoing 
communication.
 
 
School Description:
 
Hollywood Park Elementary School is a small, neighborhood school that is culturally diverse.  We 
have a cohesive staff that works co
llaboratively to provide exciting and creative lessons in English 
Language Arts, Math, Social Studies, Science, Physical Education, and Art.  We have a small, but 
active PTO that works hard to provide fundraisers, assemblies, campus beautification, and oth
er 
school wide events.  Our Leadership Club focuses on community service projects and school spirit.  
Our goal is that the students at Hollywood Park Elementary School will move on to middle school 
& beyond with a skill set that includes a strong academic 
foundation, the ability to use and work 
with technology, the capacity to work collaboratively with their peers, be leaders who show 
empathy & compassion for others, and to develop a love of learning.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pu
blish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepa
re a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consiste
nt with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing te
achers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current cu
rricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the adoption 
and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered textbook
s 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
