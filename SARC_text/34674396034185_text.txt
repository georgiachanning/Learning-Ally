School Description
 
The Oak Ridge staff is committed to building a community of well
-
rounded, confident, critical 
thinkers who are intrinsically motivated and empowered with a passion for learning.  Students with 
positive character who are prepared to collaboratively work wit
h others for high levels of success 
and happiness in life's path.
 
 
We continue to have our school goals reflect our mission in an effort to better meet the learning 
needs of our students.  Our school is focused on the following six school
-
wide goals:
 
 
1.
 
To d
ecrease chronic absenteeism in grades K
-
2 by 10% by the end of the 2019
-
2020 school 
year.
 
2.
 
Oak Ridge Elementary School will increase the number of primary students on track by 
10% from 59% to 69% as measured by site phonics and fluency testing and ELA 
proficiency 
for students in grades 3
-
6 as measured by site comprehension
 
testing and CAASPP ELA 
data will increase by 10% from 16% to 26% on track.
 
3.
 
In 2019
-
2020, increase the percent of students on track in math as measured by CAASPP 
from 12% to 20%.
 
4.
 
By Ju
ne 2020, English Learner reclassification rates will increase from 9.3% to 12% as 
measured by district PATII data.  Points below standard in ELA as measured by the CA 
Dashboard will decrease from 108.8 below standard to 78.2 below
 
standard.
 
5.
 
Develop a posit
ive school climate that supports the social and emotional needs of all 
students.
 
6.
 
Develop practices that enhance positive home
-
school relationships and empower families 
as partners within our school community.
 
 
Our overall approach stresses challenging and 
refining our belief systems, creating a healthy 
academic climate, and providing engaging instruction.  We believe this will help all students thrive 
academically.  We encourage students to make responsible choices through our Social Emotional 
Learning prog
ram that consists of a character education program, Restorative Practices, and 
educational resources to support our school wide themes on these topics.  Students receive 
SUCCESS tickets by demonstrating safe, respectful, and responsible behavior.
 
 
Somethin
g genuinely special and unique about Oak Ridge is the support we get from our 
community partners. We appreciate the strong bonds that have been formed with Soil Born Farms, 
Orrick Law Firm, City of Refuge and others. Our Partnerships work closely with the 
school to ensure 
that every student receives a quality learning experience.
 
 
We recognize that, above all, our single most important partnership is the one we foster with each 
of our families. Parents, grandparents, caregivers, foster parents, 
guardians, and extended family 
members are encouraged to be present at school in a variety of ways. We welcome warmly the 
support we receive from families who read and do homework with their children, volunteer for 
yard duty, attend monthly community meeti
ngs, support our Family Teacher Academic Team 
(FTAT) family nights, and serve on traditional committees such as our School Site Council or English 
Learner Advisory Committee. We truly value our families, who walk their children to school day in 
and day out
, attend parent/teacher conferences, and spend time helping in classrooms.
 
 

ensuring each child receives the best education we can possibly deliver.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of e
ach year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula
 
(LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local p
riorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The district i
nstructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students
, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials
 
effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, student
s, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instruct
ional materials being considered for adoption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documen
tation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

m its most recent facility 
inspection in September 2018.  The distr
ict governing Board has adopted cleanliness standards for all district schools to ensure that all schools are clean, 
safe and functional.  The district Operations Department takes great pride following a work order process that provides effic
ient and timel

Quick Strike projects during the summer of 2014, which allowed schools to pick from one of the following improvements: 1) mar
quees, 2) closed
-
circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior
 
painting, or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district schools 
were upgraded.  Additional 10 million dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to beg
in in 2019.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
