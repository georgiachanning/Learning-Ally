By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Schools can be rated at Good, Fair, or Poor.  On the FIT, dated August 2019, seven of the eight sections were ranked as 
Good and the area of "Interior Surfaces" was m
arked as Fair.  A more detailed inspection of the interior ranked the office, 
classrooms, stage, and kitchen as Good.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the 
general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the 
CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed c
ourses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Chapman Hills 
Elementary School is fortunate to have a tremendously involved parent and community support base. The 
Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA) is an integral part of the overall school program. Many of the programs mentioned in 
this report would not be in place if
 
it were not for the tireless and constant support of this organization. The PTA uses 
fund
-
raisers and volunteer hours to enhance the instructional program at Chapman Hills. Parent volunteers are on campus 
daily providing classroom help, clerical and proje
ct support, field study trips and a variety of other services and academic 
programs. For additional information pertaining to organized opportunities for parental involvement, please contact the 
school office.
 
 
Chapman Hills Elementary School Site Council 
(SSC) and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), composed of staff 
and parents, review the school plan  (SPSA) and its effectiveness and approves the expenditures of the Local Control 
Funding Formula provided by the state.  Both committees also review
 
the Annual Program Evaluation to make decisions 
about existing and new programs and expenses. The SSC/ELAC meets at least quarterly and invites all interested parents 
to attend meetings.
 
 
Chapman Hills parents coordinate annual book fairs, 6th
-
grade Outdo
or Education fundraisers, Red Ribbon Week 
activities, Annual Campouts, Field Day and Carnival. They assist in the library and STEM Lab, with vision and hearing 
screening and school pictures; they partner with the Principal on Wellness Committees, school di
rectory, and yearbook, 
etc. Our parents and students participate in our annual Holiday Heroes community outreach project during the holiday 
season by adopting local foster and adoptive families to support those families in need.  We partner with Orange Cou
nty 
Social Services and have been the only elementary school in the county to provide this support.  During the 2019
-
2020 
school year, Chapman Hills will be able to support a record number of families during the holiday season.
 
 
Due to successful fundraise

curriculum. Profits from these funds support educational programs including enrichment assemblies such as the 
Imagination Machine, Art Masters, Happiness is NOW assembly
 
and Field Trips. In addition, PTA funds support our student 
incentive program, purchase library books, classroom materials, technology and much more.

32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updat
e their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
Student and Community Services. The office of Student and Community Services provides plan development assistance to 
the schools and maintains a file 
of individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
A comprehensive disaster plan is in effect and fire and/or earthquake drills are conducted on a monthly basis.  Campus 
Lock Down drills are also conducted throughout the year.  The office 
of School and Community Services participates in the 
planning of such drills to help each school prepare for worst case scenarios. All schools in the district are linked through 
an emergency radio contact system, and district radio drills are held periodic
ally to be prepared in case of an actual 
disaster. Providing a safe environment for our students is of paramount importance at Chapman Hills Elementary School. 
All staff members are assigned to specialized teams including the Command Center, Sweep and Resc
ue, First Aid, 
Assembly/Parent Assistance, and Security/Site Operations. These disaster procedures are outlined in detail in the School 
Site Disaster Plan.

and school

based in

house
 
(district) experts provide school 
and district
-
level staff with curriculum development in identified areas of need. During the 2017
-
2018 school year, there 
was professional development provided to all teachers prior to the start of the year.   Chapman Hil
ls remained on a 
Modified Wednesday schedule to allow for professional development and teacher collaboration throughout the year.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year our focus is on Writing.  Professional development has been focused on writing across 
the co
ntent areas.  As a staff we have had a strong focus in the are of UDL (universal design for learning).  Lastly, this year 
we focused on Bully Prevention 
-
PBIS to help support our students to have a universal language in the are of character 
development and
 
how to be an up stander.
 
 
During the school year, all staff members participated in Write From the Beginning and Beyond,  EnVision, NGSS, STEAM, 
close reading, technology, and student engagement training.  The teachers attended staff development on the co
ntinued 
implementation of CC and other related topics on their Modified Wednesdays.  All classrooms integrated Thinking Maps 
across all areas of the curriculum and included Communication Objectives and Response Frames.
 
In 2018
-
2019, there is an emphasis on
  
EnVision Math with the integration of technology, STEM education specifically 
focusing on our T4T STEM lab, AVID and Technology integration across the curricular areas.
 
 
The faculty and staff at Chapman Hills are committed to a program of ongoing profess
ional development. Individual 
teachers are encouraged to attend at least one professional development training session in identified areas of need or 
focus in addition to those offered during after school staff development workshops. Teachers are asked to 
share the 
knowledge they have gained with their grade
-
level partners. Team teaching throughout the school ensures that every 
teacher has one or more partners within their grade level. This facilitates collaboration, the sharing of ideas, as well as 
peer mo
deling of instruction.
