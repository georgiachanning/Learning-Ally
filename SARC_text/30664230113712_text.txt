School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 

 
 
The mission of Orange Grove is to maximize the academic potential of all students to develop confident and responsible 
life
-
long learners.
 
 

 
At Orange Grove, our students are responsible and academically successful in a rigorous, enriching, and engaging learning 
environment.
  
 
 
School Profile
 
Orange Grove Elementary School serves approximately 630 
students in TK through grade six. 
 
In 2018, a TK Dual Language 
Immersion (DLI) classroom in Spanish was started. The DLI instructional program will continue to grow as students 
promote from grade to grade. 
 
It was established in 2006 and currently has a ce
rtificated staff that includes a music 
teacher, curriculum coach, intervention teacher, Resource Specialist teacher, Speech and Language Specialist and a 
counselor. 
 
In addition to administration, there is a part
-
time school psychologist, nurse, and a part
-
time Behavioral Health 
Assistant.
 
 
Our instructional focus is on utilizing Explicit Direct Instruction and scaffolding strategies that support a
ll students, 
including English learners, across all curricular areas to ensure all students have access to a well
-
rounded 
curriculum. 
 
There is an emphasis on developing language and problem solving skills by providing ample opportunities for 
Academic Disc
ourse and the use of Standards for Mathematical Practice. We continue to focus on implementing Thinking 
Maps effectively and Write from the Beginning and Beyond. 
 
We are in the process of establishing a strong focus on using 
Positive Behavioral Interventio
ns and Supports (PBIS) to teach our students about expected behaviors that promote 
respect, responsibility, and safety. 
 
 
In 2018 Orange Grove fully committed to implementing STEAM instructional programs and practices that are integrated 
throughout the cur
riculum. 
 
Our students and staff are active participants in the 100 Mile Club. 
 
 
Identified Gifted and Talented (GATE) students in grades 3
-
6 participate in a program purposefully designed to meet their 
learning needs. 
 
All have an Individualized Learning 
Plan that outlines instructional goals and strategies to ensure 
appropriate levels of rigor. Special education students have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) which guide their 
instructional support in their regular classroom as serviced by the RSP te
acher and Speech and Language Specialist. 
 
A 
Collaborative Kindergarten class provides an inclusive environment for students with IEPs in a general education 
environment.
 
 

l of whom have the CLAD or BCLAD 
certification.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
