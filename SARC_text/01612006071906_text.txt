By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Our strong community partnerships enrich our academic focus across all subjects. Arroyo Seco Elementary School is 
located in close proximity to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory, affording us the 
unique opp
ortunity for a strong partnership that enriches our science curriculum through field trips and the Teaching 
Opportunities for Partners in Science (TOPS) program. Through the support of local restaurants, several students each 
month are awarded the opportun
ity to dine and visit with the principal. Other community partnerships include Waste 
Management, the Livermore Police and Fire Departments, the Livermore Heritage Guild, the Livermore Area Recreation 
and Park District (LARPD), the Bankhead Theater, Rotary,
 
and local restaurants and businesses. In addition, a majority of 
our teachers have been recipients of technology grants hosted through the Donors Choose Program sponsored by 
Chevron. In partnership with our parent community, Arroyo Seco Elementary School 
enjoys a high level of parent 
involvement. Parents contribute through individual donations, classroom volunteerism, and programs such as the Fine 
Arts Mini Experience (FAME), Cultural Day, school beautification, and our famous running club. The Parent Teac
her 
Association (PTA) is a strong presence that supports programs such as fundraising, field trip scholarships, student 
interactive assemblies, family fun nights, character education, student valet program, and Junior Achievement.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Arroyo Seco opened in 1971. During the 2003
-
04 school year, the sc
hool underwent major reconstruction. A new wing 
was added, which included eight classrooms, offices, storage space, and restrooms. Two additional portables were added 
in 2005 to add two science labs. The landscape was also redesigned, including the additio
n of a large grass playfield, a new 
blacktop and play equipment. During the summer of 2008, the front rooms of Arroyo Seco were renovated and enclosed 
with a fence. We have a large gymnasium, which also serves as our cafeteria; a stage for theater producti
ons; and a library 
stocked with approximately 11,000 titles. We have a computer lab with 40 computers with internet access. Teachers have 
workstations in their classrooms with internet access and additional computers for student use. Five Chromebook carts 
circulate among classrooms, providing 32 computers per cart. All classrooms recently received state of the art audio visual 
systems provided by funding from the Measure J Facilities Bond.
 
 
Two full
-
time custodians and one part
-
time custodian keep the schoo
l clean, and each class is assigned an area of weekly 
cleanup. Our campus includes access for students with disabilities. Two years ago, we improved the gates and fences to 
promote a safe and secure environment. All visitors must enter through the office t
o register before going to a classroom. 
Arroyo Seco employs six campus supervisors who start working 30 minutes before school opens and stay until the students 
enter the classrooms. Campus supervisors report back to monitor the students during the lunch pe
riod. Teachers monitor 
the students during recesses. After
-
school supervision is shared with workers from the after
-
school program located on 
campus. 
 
 
Over the summer, we were fortunate enough to get two new play structures. Through the support of the fac
ilities bond, 
we were able to receive solar panels in our parking lot, through the support of the facilities bond. We are continuing to 
work on making improvements on our school facility.
 
 
Education is a top priority in the community of Livermore, and main
taining a safe and orderly environment maximizes 
student learning. The citizens of Livermore have passed three major funding measures targeting school facility needs: 
Measure B in 1975, Measure L in 1999 and, most recently in June 2016, the generous and su
pportive Livermore community 
passed the Measure J Facilities Bond. 
 
 
Measure J funds will be used to:
 

 
Modernize classrooms, science labs and educational technology for 21st century instruction
 

 
Repair aging infrastructure: roofs, plumbing, HVAC and 
electrical systems
 

 
Renovate facilities for advanced science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and Career Technical 
Education (CTE) courses
 

 
Improve safety, including security lighting, fencing, fire safety, and other emergency systems
 

 
Upgrade 
deteriorated hardscapes, physical education facilities, and pick
-
up/drop
-
off zones
 

 
Increase access to school facilities to better accommodate individuals with disabilities
 
Through these bond measures and developer fees, the LVJUSD has been able to renovate
, modernize and construct new 
schools following the Facilities Master Plan.

Facilities are maintained through the diligent efforts of the site custodial crews and the district maintenance staff. The 
LVJUSD Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards
 
for all schools in the LVJUSD. The principal works with the 
custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to maintain clean and safe schools. District maintenance staff performs the 
repairs necessary to keep the schools in good working order in a timely m
anner. A work
-
order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Livermore Valley Joint 
Unified School District (LVJUSD) values active parent engagement and believes that parent 

recognizes that parents/guardians are their child

involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school 
environment. The Superintendent or designee shall work with staff and parent
s/guardians to develop meaningful 
opportunities at all grade levels for parents/guardians to be involved in district and school activities; advisory, decision
-

 
 
Educational research su
ggests that highly effective schools have a number of features in common, including high levels of 

high levels and have more well
-
rounded 
educational experiences. LVJUSD parents are welcome partners in our school 
community. There are a range of opportunities for parents to engage with schools, including Parent Teacher Associations 
(PTAs), Parent Faculty Associations (PFAs), sports and activi
ty booster clubs, and other supporter groups. On a monthly 

Communication and Information Council (PCIC). This gathering provides an opportun
ity for parent groups to collaborate 
with each other and representatives of the district regarding events, opportunities, and activities for students and families
. 
This is also a time district representatives share new initiatives and current information w
ith parent leaders. In addition, 
parents have the opportunity to share general concerns and ask questions directly to the superintendent. Each school also 
has formal advisory groups including School Site Councils (SSCs) and English Learner Advisory Committ
ees (ELACs) who 
represent other parents at the site and are critical in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement (SPSA). A representative from each SSC serves on the district Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 
Advisor
y Committee, and a member of each ELAC serves on the District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC), which 
also serves as the LCAP English Learner Advisory Committee. Through these two
-
way systems of parent support and 
engagement, parents, district, and
 
school staff have open lines of communication and opportunities to engage in 
meaningful ways with the school community.
 
 
Arroyo Seco enjoys a high level of parental involvement. In fact, the cornerstone of our success is firmly embedded in our 
partnership
 
with our parents. Many of our programs are supported through volunteering, fundraising, sponsoring and 
participating in committees. Parents volunteer daily in all classrooms and run our copy center and our morning valet 
program. Parents also participate i
n the School Site Council (SSC) and our Parent Teacher Association (PTA). The PTA 
organizes our primary fundraising event, the Stampede. The PTA also runs the weekly ice cream and popcorn sales, the 
Fine Arts Mini Experience (F.A.M.E) program, and publishe

 
 
The parents at Arroyo Seco are a tremendous support and deeply committed to the success of all students. For more 
information on how to become involved at the school, contact our volunteer coordinator at

influences the opportunities for 
students to achieve at the highest levels. In line with our District Professional Development Plan, we offer and support 
ongoing growth opportunities that allow every teacher, administrator, and 
staff member to further develop the 
appropriate knowledge, skills, and practices required to create learning environments that allow all students to 
demonstrate high levels of achievement. Our Board of Education and our district administration recognize th
at all staff 
members of the LVJUSD must be provided time and support to acquire, improve, and enhance professional knowledge, 
practices, and skills.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2020 school year, relevant and timely professional development will be available and deliv
ered to 
employees. In addition, two designated professional development days and the flexible professional development day for 
certificated staff provide the option of individualized professional growth for teachers. Professional development will 
primarily
 
focus on effective tier one instruction; Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), student and staff 
safety; customer service; meeting the needs of students with Individual Education Plans (IEP); effective usage of 
technology as an instructiona
l tool; effective instructional practices for English learners; and implementation of specialized 
programs such as Dual Immersion, Project Lead the Way, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced Placement programs.
