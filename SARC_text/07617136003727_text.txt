By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Burton Valley Elementary School is situated on a lovely k
noll in the Burton Valley neighborhood in the city of Lafayette. 
Forty full and part
-
time highly qualified certificated teachers and over 50 support staff serve 735 Transitional Kindergarten 
through fifth grade students. The Lafayette School District Early
 
Intervention Program for three
-
 
to five
-
year olds is also 
on our campus. The Parent Teacher Association provides a wide range of volunteer services, parent education 
opportunities and financial support. The Lafayette Partners in Education is the education
 
foundation for our District, which 
provides generous financial support to our school.
 
 
We prepare our students to be creative, responsible, productive and kind citizens. Instructional kindergarten through the 
fifth grade level is currently based on adopte
d Common Core State Standards.  Research based instructional strategies, 
including critical thinking, the workshop model, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, and differentiated 
instruction, are all used in classrooms with a clear focus on meeting
 
the academic needs of each student. Teachers meet 
regularly in grade level teams or in cross grade level teams to engage in data
-
based inquiry, to share strategy 
implementation, and to monitor student progress. We commit to meet the needs of all students,
 
to foster continuous 
learning and to promote respect.  With outstanding teaching practices, collaboration, professional development and 
technology, we strive to create a successful learning environment for all students in a safe and nurturing environment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Instruction and Leadership:
 
 
District curriculum work is based on a comprehensive Three
-
Year Plan that was presented to the Governing Board in 
September of 2019. The 
plan includes implementation of key initiatives within the Strategic Plan and District Goals. The 
Three
-
Year Plan sets forth goals and priorities which serve to focus and guide the District in its instructional planning and 
align with the LCAP.
 
 
Instructio
n at all grade levels is currently based on adopted content standards. Research
-
based instructional strategies, 
including critical thinking, the workshop model, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and differentiated 
instruction are all used in all
 
classrooms with a clear focus on meeting the academic needs of each student. Teachers meet 
regularly in grade level teams or in departments to plan and engage in professional dialogue around student learning and 
to monitor student progress.

force in determining systemic, relevant professional development for the District. Curriculum Council grade level leaders 
organize and facilitate
 
District
-
wide grade level opportunities for articulation and planning. Administrators and teachers 
at all grade levels participate in professional development days, after school workshops and Professional Learning 
Communities to deepen and expand strategy
 
instruction. Site administrators at all schools are committed to providing 
focused, aligned instructional leadership. Principals meet together monthly to discuss and plan for the implementation of 
instructional strategies based on data analysis. Professio
nal Learning Communities and department meetings engage in 
professional dialogue around student data and content areas to plan and share strategies and promote deeper 
understanding of content. We have recently adopted materials aligned to Next Generation S
cience Standards with a focus 
on instructional practices providing understanding through rich tasks, discourse, and thinking.
 
 
Professional Development:
 
 
The Lafayette School District values professional development as fundamental to the success of the Dis
trict. Professional 

appreciation for the varied needs of students and enhances their capacity to facilitate the learning success of all stude
nts. 
A Professional Development Three
-
Year Plan has been developed to provide the structure and means through which 
educators continuously enhance their professional competency. Creating and sustaining a teacher effectiveness system 
that enhances student a
chievement hinges on a well
-
developed professional development strategy focused on District 
Goals. The plan includes implementation of key initiatives within the Strategic Plan and District Goals.
 
 
Our plan recognizes that high quality professional develop
ment that improves the learning of all students is: 
 

 
driven by the results of a regular and systematic analysis of a variety of data and information on student learning
 

 
focused on the effective implementation of research
-
based educational practices
 

 
respons
ive to the unique learning needs and styles of each individual educator
 

 
best accomplished through the development of collaborative learning communities whose goals are aligned 
with the priorities of the district.
 
Focus areas for professional 
development are based on assessment data, District initiatives and content standards and 
are focused on improving student achievement and deepening and strengthening teacher practice. Professional 
development also occurs at all sites in a variety of ways. 
Professional Learning Communities, book groups, peer coaching, 
demonstration lessons, after
-
school workshops, weekly K
-
5 designated meeting times and 6
-
8 grade level/department 
level meetings all provide opportunities for collaboration and professional dev
elopment. Three District

development days are scheduled throughout the year providing the opportunity for collaboration and expanding and 
deepening district curriculum work.
