By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
The facilities at Oak Run School are maintained, safe and clean. Regular maintenance and janitorial services keep Oak Run 

books 
that are networked together and Internet connected. The District office is housed in a portable that is in good 
condition. The cafeteria and (multipurpose facility) is equipped for all
-
weather dining. Recess and lunchtime activities are 
conducted on a larg
e grassy athletic field, a blacktop area for basketball and volleyball, a swing set surrounded by wood 
chips, and a large climbing play structure also surrounded by wood chips. The blacktop playground was replaced in June 
2005 through a deferred maintenanc
e critical hardship grant from the state due to poor drainage and a cracked and 
uneven surface. The main building was built in the early 1960s.
 
 
Students are well managed through visible staff duty assignments.
 
 
Oak Run School District contracts with a cle
aning service for weekly janitorial services and has a part
-
time employee to 
provide maintenance to ensure the school is kept clean, safe and in good repair.
 
 
Students are supervised by staff before and during school hours. Students who choose to stay afte
r school are enrolled in 
Project SHARE (Shasta Health Academic and Recreation Enrichment) or participating in after school music lessons and/or 
school sponsored clubs.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Safety Plan review date: (must be done by March 1  of each school year) February 2020
 
 
Oak Run 
School has a school safety plan developed by staff, administration and parents, which the DAC, SSC and Board of 
Trustees approved. Drills for fire evacuation are conducted monthly to ensure all staff and students are familiar with and 
ready to carry out al
l emergency procedures, should it be necessary to do so.
 
 
Oak Run School participates in a variety of antidrug assemblies and emphasizes the national Red Ribbon Week activities 
every October. Phones and intercoms are installed in every room with voicemail 
capabilities. Visitors and volunteers must 
sign in and out every day in the district office and must wear a bright
-
colored badge visibly displaying their role on campus.
 
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school facul
ty January 2020. Key elements of 
the plan include monthly safety drills, crisis intervention plans, suicide prevention plan and our violence prevention 
curriculum.
