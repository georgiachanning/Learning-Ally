Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The vision of the Freshwater Charter Middle School (FCMS) is to offer a small, caring school environment, high academic 
standards, innovativ
e curriculum, access to and integration of technology, and meaningful participation by students, 
parents, staff, and community.
 
 
The guiding philosophy of FCMS is based on the following principles:
 

 
Every student has the right to feel safe and secure.
 

 
Every
 
student deserves the best the school has to offer.
 

 
Every student can achieve academic excellence through a challenging curriculum accompanied by appropriate 
support.
 

 
Every student can be a responsible, productive citizen, willing to give his/her talents t
o the community.
 
Therefore, Freshwater Charter Middle School will:
 

 
Provide a positive, safe, caring environment, which nurtures the intellectual, physical, emotional, and moral 
capacities of each child, so each child can lead a fulfilling life as a 
productive worker, citizen, and individual.
 

 
Develop, implement and continue to update student
-
centered, integrated curriculum which addresses the 
modalities, strengths, and social development of each student.
 

 
Provide a successful educational program for ea
ch student w hich considers his/her unique needs, abilities. 
and/or cultural background.
 

 
Provide and encourage families w ith opportunities to participate and share in the intellectual grow th of their 
children.
 

 
Enable students to become self
-
motivated, co
mpetent, and life
-
long learners.
 
The school community strives to create an environment w here the "whole child" is considered first and foremost, and 
student learning and education are the primary concern. T he environment produces consistently improving t
est scores 
because students learn and understand the process of learning.
 
 
The staff and administration strive to involve parents in the learning process, and parents are a vital part in creating and 
maintaining the educational program. The staff and commu
nity demonstrate their dedication to the needs of all students 
in many ways; from the school
-
community goal setting process to the variety of support and extracurricular activities 
made available to every child. All students have access to a balanced, comp
rehensive, standards
-
aligned curriculum. Those 
needing extra support to access curriculum receive it in a variety of ways, especially via research
-
based instructional 
practices. Students needing extra support are identified by staff or parents, and then th
e whole teaching staff collaborates 
on creating a structure for that support.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In 2000 the Freshwater School District completed the modernization of 10 classrooms, the building of a new girls' 
restroom, the remodeling of thre
e other restrooms, and the retrofit of the office area. The modernization gave the school 
a major "facelift", adding high quality carpets, safety glass windows, new electrical systems and data ports, and inside 
painting to all 10 classrooms. The new studen
t restrooms are beautifully appointed with new fixtures and tile walls and 
floors. The office area gives additional space for the business functions of the District. The lighting in the classrooms was
 
retrofitted in 2006. The school houses all of its stude
nts as well as providing a library, computer lab, meeting room, 
auditorium/cafeteria, music rooms, and Day Care. In September 2005, the new gymnasium was completed and has been 
a huge asset for the entire school community.
 
 
In 2007/08 we added 196 solar pa
nels that generate up to 70% of the school's electricity needs, and in 2014/2015 we 
added student lockers. Most recently we repaved and restriped our parking lot to improve student safety. In addition we 
have begun replacing our old fluorescent lights with
 
energy efficient LEDs, and will soon begin work installing a new 32k 

 
 
In June of 2018, The District passed Measure C, a $2.1 million dollar General Obligation Bond to modernize and renovate 
ou
r aging schools. This bond measure allowed us to improve our outdated plumbing systems, replace our roofs, and 
upgrading and upgrade our hardscape and landscape areas in the summer of 2019.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

volunteer to help with the Garden of the Dolphins, art projects, field trips, electives, class socials, Family Movie Nights, 
Lego and Game Nights, and School Scienc

to participate in fundraising efforts for the annual 8th grade trip to San Francisco.
