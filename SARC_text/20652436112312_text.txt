Welcome to Lincoln Elementary School. The Lincoln culture is reflected in the vision as a 

nurturing, educational environment where all students, regardless of 

community maintains a high level of standards to promote academic growth. Our success with a
 
standards
-
aligned curriculum begins in the classroom with a highly qualified teacher who 
understands, teaches, and facilitates what students should know and be able to do at the end of 
the year.
 
 
Lincoln teachers participate in grade level Professional Le
arning Communities (PLC), meeting at 
regular intervals to align curriculum, to review student data, and to share successful teaching 
strategies. They participate in monthly staff development to learn new instructional strategies, 
seeking to keep current wi
th new research
-
based teaching and learning strategies. Student 
achievement to their highest potential is the goal of all Lincoln teachers and staff.
 
 
Staff, students, and families work tirelessly, sharing the belief that all students can succeed at high 
s
tandards. When assessments indicate a student needs additional intervention, the Lincoln staff 
begins the Response to Intervention (RTI) process to close gaps. Parents are strongly encouraged 

a safe, healthy and happy 
environment where students learn the necessary skills for continued success in their educational 
careers.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The mission of Lincoln Elementary School is to celebrate life through learning by preparing children

Field Trips are an 
important part of student learning at Lincoln. The second grade travels to The Fossil Discovery Center, third grade to the 
county library and museum, fourth grade to San Juan Bautista Mission and Monterey Bay Aquarium, fifth grade to the Fresno Zoo
, and 
si
xth grade Hearst Castle and Calvin Crest Camp. These experiences provide our students with hands

them background knowledge that enhances classroom learning.
 
 
We provided students and parents with student

technology, arts, and homework.
 
 
Special Education Program: Lincoln is fully vested in the Center

Based Model of educating our special education students. The students 
are in the general ed
ucation classroom for the majority of their day. They are provided support from a special education staff member 
during a portion of their time. They are also pulled out of the general education environment for more intense work as is det
ermined 
appropriat

Education Plan (IEP). Lincoln has four full time special education teachers and six full time special education aides to supp
ort our stu

Lincoln has three Special Day Classes (SDC). The classes are a TK

age Development) 
is taught to our English learners for an average of 45 minutes a day during our designated instruction time. Students are gro
uped by their 
language levels so that instruction can be targeted towards their specific areas of need. The emphas
is is on oral language, listening, 
thinking, reading, and writing. Teachers evaluate students three to four times a year and monitor their progress. The results
 
of these 
assessments help teachers determine what skills need to be taught or reviewed.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 
of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 
SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding For
mula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and loc
al priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within
 
the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standard
s
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the text
books used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and
 
a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
mat
erials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lincoln Elementary was originally constructed in 1993 and is comprised of 26 standard classrooms and ten portables, a multipu
rpose room/ cafeteria, 
library, staff lounge, and playground.
 
 
Playground space is adequate
 
for the number of students we have, providing them with ample opportunity to be active during their recess times. There 
is adequate space for staff to work. Lincoln has a beautiful school library.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
 
The principal works daily with the cust
odial staff of 3 full
-
time to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe 
school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these stand
ards are availab
le at the 
district office for review. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspec
tion process. The items noted 
in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.

Maintenance and Rep
air
 
 
On a regular basis, classrooms and facilities are inspected by the custodial staff and administration to identify needed clas
sroom repairs. District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work 
orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergency repairs.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, 
which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes r
oofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interio
r or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAA
SPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through e
ight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significan
t cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Design days working with the Teacher on Special Assignment to aid in 
implementation of the Common Core State Standards. These activities help staff 
members refine existing skills, learn new skills, and gain knowledge needed for effective implementation of the curriculum. T

and support teachers (t
echnology and intervention) are directly involved in planning and conducting the staff development. During teacher planning 
time, teachers participate in grade level Professional Learning Communities (PLC), meeting at regular intervals to align curr

to review student 
data, to create common formative assessments, and to share successful teaching strategies.
