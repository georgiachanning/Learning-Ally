By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

In order to get parent input with decision making for Smith River, we have two bodies that help do that 
-
 
the first is Site 
Council.  Here our parents, community and school come together to look at and approve exp
enditures for the Title I budget 
and other activities planned for the year with an eye towards language development, foster youth, low income and 
homeless students.  The other parent school group is the ELAC committee.  This body has three meetings through
out the 
year and is a place for parents to get more information from the school site and give the school feedback as to how the 
school year is progressing.
 
 
We also love to have parent/family volunteers on campus.  We have several parents who participate i
n the Los Dichos 
program and read to our students in Spanish.  There are many different ways to volunteer

If you have an extra hour a 
week, we could use some help making copies. If you have an extra two hours per week 

 
we would love for you to read 
with
 
students. We have a very active PTSO with almost monthly activities and School Site Council can always use more 
voices and hands to get our students what they need. There is also an ELAC committee for parents of our English Language 
Learning students to h
ave a voice in our school.  There are a multitide of opportunites, please stop in and ask!  Parents

-
20)
 
 

Our Planning Committee of community members, parents, students, and teachers developed our Safe School Plan. This 
committee will continue
 
to be proactive and continuously review, evaluate, and modify the plan as needed. Both the Crisis 
Response Plan and Comprehensive School Safety Plan are designed to ensure a safe, secure, and friendly learning 
environment. The Safe School Planning Committ
ee recognizes and commends the students, staff, and community for their 
efforts in developing programs that foster an appreciation for the unique contributions of all people and raise the 
consciousness of all, with regards to our ethnic, social, and cultur
al diversity. At Smith River, we believe that all students 
can learn, and all students can behave. Behavioral and academic expectations are clearly stated in the Positive Behavior 
Intervention Systems (PBIS) handbook and reviewed by all teachers and studen
ts three times per year. Students are also 
commended for positive behavior and good decision
-
making. Our staff works every day to provide opportunities for all 
students to be successful. The students reach their full potential within the context of a carin
g and safe school 
environment. There is a great deal of support from the parents, neighborhood, community and local businesses. Our 

of th
e safe school model. The Smith River Safety plan was reviewed and approved by SSC, ELAC and SR staff in November 
2019.

Staff development is based on district initiatives and individual school and teacher needs. Student performance data, 
teacher surveys, and principal 
observations help determine professional needs. The focus of our staff development has 
been predominantly in the area of English Language Arts, English Language Development and mathmetical practices 
through trainings such as Direct Instruction, GLAD traini
ng, and workshops with instructional coaches. Teachers also work 
in grade level collaboration meetings and vertical teams to analyze student data, create action plans and discuss, model 
and observe best practices.  Teachers are supported during implementat
ion by collegial observations, walkthroughs, and 
planned teacher observations at other school to see exemplary teaching and implemenatation. Teachers were also able 
to attend grade level appropriate GLAD trainings and formal trainings on current English La
nguage Arts and Social Science 
materials.  The District offered professional development strands where teachers were able to chopose a topic to look at 
in depth.  A strand consists of 3 sessions and some topics included were instructional core, BeGLAD, int
erim assessments, 
google apps, Functional behavior analysis and Multi
-
tiered systems of support.
