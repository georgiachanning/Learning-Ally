Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

learning. Enrichment 
programs such as Lafayette Partners in Education (LPIE) and The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) compliment the 
students' academic experience. The Parent Teacher Association provides a wide range of volunteer services, parent

expectations, effective teaching strategies, challenging, motivating materials and technology, and curriculum  aligned with 
the Common Core Standards. Students will develop personal responsibility and respect for self an
d others within a caring 
community. The staff communicates this mission in daily interactions with students and parents, through voice mail, email 
and classroom newsletters and websites. Our highly qualified staff is dedicated to ongoing improvement in ins
tructional 
delivery and makes effective use of assessments to guide that instruction. The PTA supports our students through 
extensive volunteer hours and fund
-
raising efforts. Funds go directly to support students in the classroom. The Lafayette 
Partners i
n Education offers docent
-
led programs for our students in art, science and social studies.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the 
general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the 
CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed c
ourses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

There are numerous 
opportunities for parental involvement. Every classroom relies upon parent volunteers for assistance 
in the classroom, driving on field trips, and helping with special projects either at home or school. PTA relies on parent 
volunteers to fill all of the po
sitions on the Executive Board, serve as committee chairpersons, and assist at various fund
-
raisers throughout the year. The school's PTA website can be found at: 
https://sites.google.com/lafayettepta.info/lafayettepta?scrlybrkr.   Parent volunteers serve 
on the School Site Council, 
and school leadership asks parent volunteers to serve on district
-
wide committees.

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety and Emergency Plans are on file in the school office. Plans and procedures are reviewed annually with 
the staff at the beginning of the school year and throughout the year as needed.  We have monthly drills so
 
that staff and 
students know how to respond in the case of fire, earthquake, and school lock down situations. In the case of an 
emergency, teachers and staff have assigned roles to ensure student safety and well being.  Should the need to be on 
campus for
 
an extended period of time arise, we are prepared with emergency radios, food, water, toilets and first aid 
supplies. Staff received training in December of 2017 from our Police Chief about how to respond in the case of the need 
to lock down our campus. O
ur PTA replaced and updated all of our emergency supplies in the spring of 2018. All classroom 
doors have been fitted with push button locks and the locks in other areas of the school have quick locking mechanisms.

School Instruction and Leadership:
 
 
District curriculum work is based on a comprehensive Three
-
Year Plan that was presented to the Governing Board in 
September of 2019. The plan includes 
implementation of key initiatives within the Strategic Plan and District Goals. The 
Three
-
Year Plan sets forth goals and priorities which serve to focus and guide the District in its instructional planning and 
align with the LCAP.
 
 
Instruction at all grade
 
levels is currently based on adopted content standards. Research
-
based instructional strategies, 
including critical thinking, the workshop model, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and differentiated 
instruction are all used in all classrooms wi
th a clear focus on meeting the academic needs of each student. Teachers meet 
regularly in grade level teams or in departments to plan and engage in professional dialogue around student learning and 
to monitor student progress. 
 
 

Council meets monthly to discuss and review all areas of the curriculum. They are also a guiding 
force in determining systemic, relevant professional development for the District. Curriculum Council grade level leaders 
organize and facilitate District
-
wide
 
grade level opportunities for articulation and planning. Administrators and teachers 
at all grade levels participate in professional development days, after school workshops and Professional Learning 
Communities to deepen and expand strategy instruction. 
Site administrators at all schools are committed to providing 
focused, aligned instructional leadership. Principals meet together monthly to discuss and plan for the implementation of 
instructional strategies based on data analysis. Professional Learning C
ommunities and department meetings engage in 
professional dialogue around student data and content areas to plan and share strategies and promote deeper 
understanding of content. We have recently adopted materials aligned to Next Generation Science Standar
ds with a focus 
on instructional practices providing understanding through rich tasks, discourse, and thinking.

Goals. The plan includes implementation of key initiatives within the Strategic Plan and District Goals.
 
 
Our plan recognizes that high quality professional development that impr

with the priorities of the district.
 
Focus areas for professional development are based on 
assessment data, District initiatives and content standards and 
are focused on improving student achievement and deepening and strengthening teacher practice. Professional 
development also occurs at all sites in a variety of ways. Professional Learning Com
