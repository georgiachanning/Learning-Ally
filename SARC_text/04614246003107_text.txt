By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
August, 2019
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are 
important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional mater
ials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a task force comprised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education.
 
 
The CUSD 
convenes curricular task forces to review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade 
state adopted list concurrent with the adoption cycle.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all
 
schools are clean, safe, and functional. Supervision is provided for students 
before school at 7:30 a.m. and after school until 2:45 p.m. The CARD after
-
school program is available on the Sierra View 
campus to parents through the Chico Area Recreation Dep
artment (CARD). Visitors are required to sign in at the office 
and obtain a visitor or volunteer badge to be worn while on campus. Staff has been trained to report any suspicious 
activity.
 
 
Sierra View was built in 1953, expanded in 1956, and again in 1989
. We have 27 classrooms, 8 of which are portable. The 
nine
-
acre campus also includes a multipurpose room, kitchen, library, administrative offices, staff room, small meeting 
rooms, and adequate playground space for the students housed on this campus. In ad
dition, one Special Education 
classroom is located on our campus. During 1993, the original building underwent reconstruction funded by the state. This 
project included the removal of asbestos, the addition of a new air
-
conditioning/heating system, renovat
ion of flooring, 
wall covering, lowered ceilings, and new cabinetry. The multipurpose room, offices, and 10 classrooms were included in 
the project.  All classrooms have adequate space and have air
-
conditioning.  Adequate playground space is available. A 
n
ew play structure was installed on the playground in 2008 and a track in the mid
-
1990s. Restrooms are located at the 
end of each building and accessible from the playground.  PTA has funded the redesigned courtyard area to provide tables, 
benches, patio ar
ea and planters. The Primary Courtyard was completed in 2003. The Intermediate Courtyard was 
renovated using a combination of district, PTA, and site funds in 2016. In August of 2019 Sierra View received the following 
improvements; all student bathrooms we
re renovated with new stalls and fixtures throughout. The main corridor, 
multipurpose room and the front of the school all received a fresh coat of paint. Two new air conditioners were replaced 
as well. The PTO in collaboration of our local Sunrise Rotary 
Club renovated and improved our existing track.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency rep
airs are given the highest 
priority. Minor repairs and general maintenance are taken care of by the onsite custodian. The principal works daily with 
the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alt
ernate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Our school is participating in our 2nd year of Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) trainings to assist us in creati
ng 
a positive school culture.  A
 
team consisting of teachers, aides, supervisors, parents and the principal are receiving this 
training and has had a crucial role in developing and implementing procedures. This committee is responsible for gathering 
input from all facets of the school co
mmunity and is a part of facilitating the implementation process, to include staff 
training. The majority of the teaching staff has participated in a series of i
-
Ready training's to support our ELA and Math 
programs.
 
 
CUSD will continue focusing on the Thr
ee High Impact Strategies and small group instruction. Mathematics 
instruction/curriculum will also be a focus area based on multiple year's SBAC results. Opportunities will continue to be 
provided for teachers to do peer observations as a way of learning 
from one another to improve instructional practices.
 
 
Methods by which professional development is delivered at Sierra View include: staff meetings, PLC meetings, district
-
wide staff development/workshops, out of district workshops and conferences, classro
om observations, peer 
mentoring/coaching, etc.
 
 
Teachers are supported through the following:  teacher
-
principal meetings, student performance data reporting, 
Teacher/Student Support Teacher, SBIT meetings and PBIS committee. Opportunities to meet in grade
 
level PLCs are 
provided to analyze student performance data, develop interventions and plan instruction. Staff training is designed to 
improve teaching skills and therefore improve student learning.
