School Description
 
We envision a community of learners where:
 

 
All children learn and achieve grade level standards.
 

 
Clearly articulated, data driven, and research based 
instruction is aligned to the 
Common Core Standards.
 

 
Positive values and strong character are encouraged within our students.
 

 
Staff development, risk
-
taking, creativity, and collaborative decision
-
making are 
supported.
 

 
Students feel secure, safe, and nurtu
red.
 

 
Open communication and collaboration exists between all members of the school 
community.
 

 
Students are prepared for participation in the culturally diverse, technologically rich, 
democratic society of the twenty
-
first century.
 
The Huntington Seacliff s
chool community places a high value on education. This value is evidenced 
by a phenomenal degree of parental involvement and generous participation by the school 
community. Volunteers contribute countless hours assisting in classrooms, working in our media
 
center, organizing school and community fundraisers, and contributing to decision
-
making 
committees. 
 
 
Seacliff's 27 classrooms surround shared learning corridors that are designed with networked 
learning stations. The open architecture of the corridors a
llows resources of the mind and materials 
to be shared with ease. It facilitates peer coaching as both teachers and students learn from each 
other. Our state
-
of
-
the
-
art library media center serves as the resource and technological heart of 
the school. Curr
ently, one classroom, room 21, is being piloted with a 21st Century makeover as 
part of the renovation plan from the passage of the Measure Q bond. Plan have been approved for 
modernization to begin in summer 2020.
 
 
Stepping into a classroom at Seacliff, o
ne would immediately take notice of the warm, positive, and 
supportive tone that permeates the school climate. The Seacliff Code of Conduct clearly defines 
behavior expectations and consequences, which support our purpose. Our school's "3 R's", 
Respect, Re
sponsibility, and Personal Regard, stand as a goal for each student's character 
development, defining expectations for moral and ethical decision
-
making, and acceptance of 
personal responsibility. Visitors often comment on the campus orderliness, engaging 
classroom 
environments, and comfortable spirit at Seacliff School. 
 
 
Recent honors support the staff and community's commitment to making a difference. In June 
2014, the school was honored as a 2014 Distinguished School recipient. In October 2014, the scho
ol 
was awarded the highest honor of being named a 2014 National Blue Ribbon School. Seacliff was 
also honored with the 2015 California Gold Ribbon Award.

Assessment plays a pivotal role in our standards
-
based system by providing benchmarks for teaching a
nd learning and by shaping the 
performance of educators and students. Professional growth is a priority for all staff members. We believe that when teachers
 
are actively 
encouraged and provided opportunities to develop and grow professionally, dynamic lear
ning takes place for both students and teachers. 
Seacliff staff members see themselves as an essential part of the support system for students. We strive to identify and deve
lop the special 
abilities and talents of each child. All members of our school com
munity implement instructional innovations that support the at
-
risk child 
and challenge our highest performing students, ensuring each student's success in our mission: Making a Difference for Each O
ne! The 
School Plan for Student Achievement's (SPSA) goal
s reflect Seacliff's three
-
tiered model of intervention based on prevention, early 
intervention, and accelerated learning opportunities. Individual student progress is monitored through the implementation of 
Seacliff's 
assessment system. Illuminate enables
 
staff to gather current and historical information on students' performance and proficiencies. 
Teachers disaggregate state and local data to identify specific needs of sub
-
groups including low socio
-
economic student (SES), special 
education, gender, and e
thnicity. Longitudinal and subtest performance data graphs are provided for individual students. Teachers use a 
multitude of classroom formative assessments to monitor student progress toward proficiency.
 
 
Through our school's Professional Learning Communi
ties (PLC's), teachers address academic, behavioral and social/emotional concerns 
for individual students at their weekly meetings. The goal for students at
-
risk is to identify appropriate interventions and/or resources to 
promote growth in the general edu
cation setting. In cases where these interventions are not producing results, students are referred to 
our Student Study Team (SST) which includes parents, teachers, specialists, and administrators. Students benefit from our SST
 
process 
because of shared d
ecision making, and a constructive, problem
-
solving approach. Referral to the SST is simple. Team members meet to 
outline and document strengths and concerns, discuss interventions, and develop an Intervention Plan. At the conclusion of th
e SST, a 
plan of 
action is in place and a date to reconvene and check student progress is established. Response to Intervention (RTI) may incl
ude 
one
-
on
-
one, small group instruction, counseling, after school intervention, or Social 'Skills Based' group through our district
's partnership 
with Phoenix House and their Behavioral Health Intervention Program. These eight week sessions address bullying, drug prevent
ion, 
anger, self
-
esteem, and conflict resolution.
 
 
Students with Disabilities (SWD) are provided full access across 
a variety of settings to the standards
-
aligned core curriculum through a 
full inclusion model. Currently, fully included students are achieving success in regular education classrooms. They are prov
ided special 
education services as directed by their uniqu
e needs specified in their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Students with mild to moderate 
disabilities are also fully included into the regular classroom with support through "push in" or "pull out" services provide
d by a Specialized 
Academic Instruct
ion (SAI) teacher. There are two classes for students with moderate to severe disabilities in grades 1
-
5. These students 
also spend time in the regular education class for Social Studies and Science, as well as Physical Education, Art, or Music a
s determin
ed 
by the IEP team. Support systems are in place to ensure SWD success in meeting or exceeding high
-
academic and non
-
academic skills. 
The specialists collaborate with general education teachers to assist with differentiating instruction and provide academi
c support by 
using both "pull
-
out" and "push
-
in" models. The speech teacher holds weekly Lunch Bunch sessions to work on language and pragmatic 
skills for students needing extra support. The district provides Program Specialists that regularly observe SWD 
in their classrooms and 
assists teachers with curriculum accommodations, modifications, and positive behavior interventions. Also, teachers and indep
endent 
facilitators working with fully included students annually attend district staff development annuall
y to refine and improve their skills to 
assist SWD. Newly adopted district
-
wide curriculum address SWD need to access the ELA core curriculum such as Reading Mastery and 
Corrective Reading, ELA/ELD resources, ALEKS, and Math Concepts for mathematics.
 
 
Duri
ng the first full week of school, teachers are provided release time to meet individually with the special education staff to
 
discuss the 
details of each child's IEP or 504 plan. Children who qualify for the Specialized Academic Instruction program (SAI) r
eceive services through 
collaborative and/or "pull
-
out" models of instruction within the SAI teacher and the SAI support staff. Teachers work with the SAI teacher 
to provide a program of instruction that meets the needs of the child within the least restri
ctive environment and to plan modifications 
and accommodations when needed. Our fully included students are achieving outstanding success in regular education classrooms
. The 
SWD have access to the district nurse, speech and language specialist, occupation
al therapist, audiologist, and adaptive PE specialist. All 
teachers have received support and in
-
service by West Orange County Consortium for Special Education (WOCCSE) on IDEA compliance, 
identification, and modification of curriculum for SWDs, including 
those with ADD, autism, and physical limitations.
 
 
Our students speak fifteen languages, with Vietnamese as the largest group. Other languages include Spanish, Korean, Mandarin
, 
Japanese, Farsi, Polish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, and Turkish. Our
 
current 22 English learners (EL) speak nine of these 
languages. Students are placed with highly
-
trained personnel to ensure that they have equitable access to all standards
-
based programs. 
The core English Language Development (ELD) is taught by the class
room teacher using Houghton Mifflin (HM) EL Support Materials. One 
hundred percent of Seacliff teachers are EL authorized, and 40% are trained in Guided Language Acquisition Development (GLAD)
 
strategies, which emphasize Specifically Designed Academic Inst
ruction in English (SDAIE) instructional techniques. All Seacliff teachers 
have received training to use Thinking Maps, and Pathways to Proficiency 
-
 
EL training. These strategies equip teachers with many tools 
to assist ELs in learning the core curriculum
 
to increase proficiency in English and state standards. The SSC supports the EL program by 
providing categorical funds to purchase materials and fund staff training. Teachers use the ELD standards to plan and impleme
nt 
standards
-
aligned lessons. Interpret
ers are available for parent/teacher conferences, Student Study Team (SST), and IEP meetings to 
ensure that all parents are fully informed of their children's progress.

Regular school attendance is encouraged and carefully monitored for student 
success. Tardies and absences are routinely addressed via 
written correspondence and conferences with parents.
 
 
Acceleration/extension is provided to students as appropriate. In fifth grade math, for example, instructional practices are 
refined and 
planned
 
according to student pretests and frequent chapter Quick Checks to strategically target standards not yet mastered and to 
differentiate instruction for those who need additional challenges or would benefit from interventions. In other subject area
s, stude
nts 
use the iPad App, Socrative, to answer teacher's questions about new content so they can check for understanding and plan acc
ordingly. 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo

of students who met 
or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note:
 
Double dashes (

oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes al

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and the community are exceptionally supportive of the educational programs at Hunting
ton Seacliff School. The Huntington Seacliff Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) has made generous contributions of time and money to numerous programs and activities. PTA fundrais
ers enable the school 
to offer additional programs in art, STEAM, and reading. 
In addition to enriching classroom learning experiences through donations, the PTA also supports 
assemblies and field trips and the purchase of instructional materials for individual teachers and grade levels to support cl
assroom learning programs.
 
 
Parent
 
participation in the Seacliff classrooms is critical to the success of our school. Teachers design their lessons knowing pare
nts will assist in the 
classroom to allow for small group and individualized instruction. Additionally, Seacliff  parents support 
the implementation of our homework program 
by establishing an environment in which the homework can be completed, monitoring their child's efforts, and reviewing homewo
rk for accuracy and 
completion.
 
 
The programs offered at Huntington Seacliff are annuall
y reviewed, open for comment/suggestion, and approved. Parents can review programs at Back
-
to
-
School Night, parent
-
teacher conferences, Open House, and School Site Council meetings. Huntington Seacliff's School Site Council has had the 
opportunity to revie
w draft copies of the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and provide feedback and recommendations. In addition, each time the 
School Site Council meets, members are able to vote on important issues.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information r
elevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply
 
with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Our school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within 
their safe school plans: 
current status and assessment
 
of school crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a high level of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notific
ation to
 
teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; an
d school rules and procedures.
 
 
Our school evaluates the plan annually and makes any modifications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Sa
fe School Plan, were 
reviewed with school and district staff at the beginning of the 2019
-
20 
school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 2020.
 
 
The district progressively addresses structural needs at each school to ensure facilities are safe and comply with education 
codes as well as building and 
saf
ety regulations. One automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administration building. A $169 million bond
 
(Measure Q) approved 
in November 2016 provides the necessary funding for District
-
 
wide modernization efforts. The Seacliff campus
 
was under construction during the 2019
-
20 school year and major improvements included the renovation of learning spaces, roof replacement, and redesigned outdoor le
arning spaces. 
Permanent campus perimeter fencing was completed during winter 2019 to incre
ase student safety.

Write from The Beginning
 
 
The improvement process at Huntington Seacliff School is ongoing. Teachers play the lead role in determining changes in the c
urriculum and professional 
development topics. Staff development is desig
ned to support the action plans developed in each curricular area and the school plan as a whole.
 
 
The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, i
nstructional 
materials, 
implementation timelines, and student achievement. Feedback is gathered at the site level through direct input and staff obse
rvation. Periodic Curriculum 
Development Committees are formed to address identified areas of need and focus. In alignme
nt with the district's long
-
range curriculum plan, staff 
development opportunities are available for teachers, support personnel, administrators, and classified staff at Huntington S
eacliff School. A 
comprehensive school plan is in place which guides curri
culum improvement. Focus areas for each year are determined by student achievement, district 
focus areas, parent and staff survey results, and the textbook adoption cycle. Progress is assessed yearly using multiple cri
teria including the previous 
year's st
andardized testing results, writing sample results, reading test results, student work, teacher observation, and criterion ba
sed testing.  Focus 
areas for staff development included math strategies, analysis of benchmark assessment training, implementation
 
of our math series including all support 
components, implementation of our ELA/ELD program including all support components, and integration of technology as a part o
f blended learning in 
the curriculum.
 
 
School funds are used to enable staff members to a
ttend teaching seminars and other events designed to enhance their teaching techniques and expand 
their knowledge base. Release days are provided for teachers to participate in coaching support and observe best practice in 
one another's classrooms.  
Teache
rs new to the profession are supported by peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in
-
services offered by the West Orange County Consortium 
for Special Education or education consultants. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject
-
specific seminars and ma
jor conferences and share what they 
learn with other staff members. The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional support and opp
ortunities to new 
teachers. The program is designed to assist those new to teaching to expand a
nd deepen their teaching skills, help the school district retain more new 
teachers, and improve learning opportunities for students.  Classified staff and instructional assistants are provided traini
ng and development 
opportunities at the school, district,
 
and county levels. Training for classified staff are geared to their specialty areas.

Types of Services Funded
 
A significant portion of Huntington Seacliff School's overall budget is allocated for professional development activities to 
support improved instruction 
such as 
Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Number Talks, FactsWise, Math and ELA/ELD coaching sessions, or for teachers to attend 
the California 
Association for the Gifted (CAG) conference. Staff members who attend teaching seminars and other events designed to
 
enhance their teaching 
techniques expand their knowledge base. Teachers who attend conferences, seminars, and other events are encouraged to share w
hat they learn with 
other staff members. Teachers who are new to the profession are supported by peer coach
ing and are encouraged to attend and participate in 
professional growth opportunities.
 
 
For students identified and who meet eligibility criteria, Seacliff provides Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) instruction
 
through cluster classes for 
grades two thr
ough five. Instruction within these classes focuses on teaching grade level standards through the use of Sandra Kaplan's dept
h and 
complexity icons. This program provides challenging instruction to students capable of achieving significantly beyond the lev
el of their peers. GATE classes 
are taught by fully credentialed, GATE
-
trained teachers, who annually participate and attend GATE training and workshops sponsored by the California 
Association for the Gifted.
 
 
Donation and PTA monies are also used to suppo
rt intervention programs and personnel such as the after school Read Naturally and Read 180 programs 
and the Kindergarten support aide. Monies are also used to purchase books and materials, such as building a specific library 
section of books for the 
Engli
sh learners (EL). A large portion of the funding is a result of generous donations by parents through Parent Teacher Associat
ion (PTA) or given by 
individuals directly to the school. This funding is allocated to art, field trips, assemblies, books and mate
rials, technology, and supplemental non
-
fiction 
text.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
