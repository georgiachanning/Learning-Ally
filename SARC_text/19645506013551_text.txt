School Description
 
The dedicated teachers, support staff, parents and community members believe our students 

and quality first instructional strategy approach. Our stakeholders 
(parents, teachers, support staff, 
and community members) work cohesively to address the needs of all students. In support of this 
effort, the Hillcrest Mission statement was created and institutionalized through an ongoing 
community
-
wide collaborative eff
ort. Hillcrest Elementary School serves approximately 400 
students in seven grade levels from Kindergarten through sixth grade. The majority of these 
students come from the cities of Monterey Park, South San Gabriel and Rosemead. Our school 
population is a
pproximately 49% Asian and 41% Hispanic. Approximately 63% of our students 
receive free/reduced priced lunch. All students receive breakfast free of charge. Approximately 
32% of the population are identified as English Learners (EL). There are many program
s and services 
to help students who do not speak, read, write, or understand English well. The overall goal of these 
programs is to improve the English language skills of students. We have established partnerships 
that have helped us achieve our goals. Hil
lcrest School has a skilled and dedicated staff that works 
long hours before and after school, engages in extensive professional development trainings, 
planning and collaboration efforts, uses differentiated instructional strategies and materials, 
emphasiz
es academic and social growth success while encouraging a strong home

communication link.  Furthermore, in 2018
-
19, we began our Mandarin Dual Language Program in 
Kindergarten and have since expanded to include 1st grade during the 2019
-
20 school ye
ar.  Our 
program is unique in that we also provide an hour of Spanish to our Kindergarteners and first 
graders during our after school program, through a partnership with Woodcraft Rangers.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
The Hillcrest Elementary School Community work

stands as a unifying environment for all. St
udent achievement at Hillcrest is high and continues to 
strive to improve each year for all students including all numerically significant subgroups (15% of 
the population constitutes a significant subgroup).The API has grown from 722 in 1999 to 800 in 
201
3. The achievement gap between our two significant subgroups (Asian and Hispanic) continues 
to narrow.

s;  expectations, and; specific strategies that are helpful at home.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental 
Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunit
ies for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
During the 2018
-
19 school year, parents participated in School Site Council (SSC), School Advisory Committee (SAC), English Learner Advisory 
Committee 
(ELAC), Parent Teacher Association (PTA), to learn abo
ut school policy, programs and to provide advice for school improvement. Parents and guardians 
assist teachers as volunteers in the classroom, library, teacher supply room, sports directors, performance choreographers, c
omputer labs, and many 
other areas o
f need  We reach out to all families to provide information regarding opportunities for parent involvement. Hillcrest has two
 
bilingual/bi
-
literate (Mandarin/Spanish) 5
-
hour home school coordinators who organize regularly scheduled parent involvement activ
ities and our English Learner 
Advisory Committee and School Site Council at school.
 
 
Parents, guardians and community members are an integral part of the support system for Garvey School District students and h
ave a multitude of ways 
in which they can get 
involved to contribute to students' educational experience.  Maintaining constant communication with their child's teacher(s)
, 
attending Parent/Teacher conferences, participating in Back
-
To
-
School Night and Open House, staying informed through notices, mem
os, phone calls, 
newsletters are other examples of involvement.
 
 
In accordance with Title 1 regulations, our school jointly develops with parents a school
-
parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire school 
staff, and students will share the respon
sibility for improved students academic achievement and the means by which the school and parents will build 
and engage in a partnership to help the children achieve the State's high standards.
 
 
There are ample opportunities for parents to participate in t
he governance of the school by joining any of the many committees such as School Site 
Council, ELAC, School Advisory Committee, and district level committees as well.
 
 
The purpose of the ELAC (English Learner Advisory Committee) is to advise the principal 
and the school staff on programs and services for English Learners 
and the School Site Council on the development of the School Plan for Student Achievement.  Representatives from this group a
ttend monthly DAC/DELAC 
meetings facilitated by Learning Support
 
Services.
 
 
The SSC (School Site Council) is made up of a team which includes the principal,  teachers, other school personnel, parents, 
students, and community 
members who are elected that develop the mission and goals for the improvement of an individual school community.  School Sit
e Council evaluates the 
effectiveness of the school plan and revises it based on data collected throughout 
the year.  This group meets once a month.
 
 
In addition, parents can take advantage of the numerous parent workshops that are provided by Learning Support Services, held
 
at the District Parent 
Center (IPO) on topics ranging from parenting, academic achievem
ent, children' social emotional needs, to school funding.  It is always a pleasure to

School Safety Plan
 
Extensive efforts are being made to 
control outside access to the school site offices and classrooms while school is in session. Visitors to Hillcrest 
Elementary School campus check in at the school office and receive an identification tag to be worn while at the site. All di
strict employees
 
wear personal 
name tags at all times. The Hillcrest School campus was built 67 years ago in 1953, when design considerations did not includ
e the security levels needed 
today. Additional fencing and fire safe exterior doors with security windows have been 
installed.
 
 
The Hillcrest Elementary School site conducts regularly scheduled fire, lockdown, earthquake and evacuation and disaster dril
ls to help prepare students 
and staff for emergencies. The disaster preparedness plan was designed to prepare students,
 
employees, as well as parents, for the appropriate response 
in the event of a disaster. The utility site plan lists the location of shut
-
off valves for gas, water, and electrical utilities in event of an emergency and an 
evacuation route.
 
 
The district pu
rchased one 40 foot storage container to house emergency supplies. The district employs a trained locksmith to maintain locks
 
and 
monitors all security keys. The district installed alarms at all sites and contracts with an alarm company to monitor any act
i
vity after hours. The Monterey 
Park Police Department is notified when needed. The Monterey Park Fire Department visits the site annually to check structure
s for safety compliance. 
An approved agency recharges all fire extinguishers annually. District staf
f documents all potentially dangerous chemicals and substances and stores 
them according to State and Federal standards. The district continually receives mandate instructions from governmental agenc
ies for health related 
issues and conditions and dissemin
ates information to the site. Last Updated 10/2019, Last Reviewed with Staff: 10/2019; Reviewed in a public forum:
