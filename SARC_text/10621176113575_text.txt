as it embraces the shared commitment for student success and the fundamental educational 
philosophies begun by Clovis Unified School District in 1960. In 1996, Cedarwood opened its doors 
to 575 smiling faces. With our founding principles remai
ning constant, we have embarked on our 
second decade of an educational partner
-
ship among staff, students, parents and community. The 
academic, emotional, and spiritual support within the staff and school community sets Cedarwood 
apart from other schools. 
State and local awards have validated our efforts, but what we consider 
more important is the time and effort so gladly given to our students.
 
 
Proposition 98 established the School Accountability Report Card (SARC), an initiative passed by 
California vote
rs in November 1988. The SARC provides parents and other interested individuals a 
variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes and areas that need 
improvement.
 
 
As you read this SARC for Cedarwood Elementary, I believe you will find we have established very 
high standards that strive toward academic excellence and self
-
improvement. We feel fortunate to 
serve the Cedarwood community and will continue to accommodate
 
the learning needs of all 
students. You may request additional information regarding the SARC by calling the school office 
at (559) 327

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Re
port Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountab
ility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SAR
C.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cedarwood opened in 1996 and is in its 22nd year of operation. The school is in good condition and includes permanent and por
table classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, athletic fields, and 
a library.
 
 
Deep cleaning is conducted two times a year at each site. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of 
parents in
-
spects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feedback to our s
tudent body.
 
 
When asked districtwide to grade how well the buildings and grounds are main
-


 
 
Graffiti is removed immediately. Through increased community awarene
ss, pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary 
to an all
-
time low.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes schools are the hub of their neighbor
-
hoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on building and maintaining excellen
t 
facilities as economically as possible.
 
 
In 2012, voters within the CUSD ap
-
proved Measure A. This bond measure of $298 million has been used to update all existing sites in the Clovis Unified 
School District. Building additions, remodels and site improv
ements will take place at all district schools.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
Safety is always our 
No. 1 concern at Cedarwood Elementary. Monthly safety drills along with crisis
-
intervention plans and daily supervision are part of 
the daily practices at Cedarwood. Cedarwood has a School Safety Plan and a School Crisis Intervention Plan on file and avail
able to all parents as well as 
the general public. Staff and parents review and update the school plans annually. Most recently, the School Safety Plan was 
updated in December 2019. 
Staff members, with input from parents and community members, develop both
 
plans to help ensure a safe and nonviolent environment for all students. 
Specific areas of focus, coupled with appropriate strategies to address concerns, feature in our school plan.
 
 
The Cedarwood Parent Club was instrumental in initiating the Cedarwood 
Crossing Guard program. This parent volunteer program has experienced great 
success and provided additional supervision and safety precautions. The Cedarwood Parent Club also helped provide new playgro
und equipment in our 
kindergarten play area. We routine
ly engage students in practice drills and class discussions in order to provide additional in
-
formation needed to respond 
to unsafe situations. On the 2019 SART survey, 88 percent of parents surveyed indicated their satisfaction with our school en
vironment
. We always strive 
to improve student responsibility and community support in keeping our campus safe.

The California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and our pursuit of student achievement with school, district and 
statewide goals guide staff 
development. It allows our staff to learn about new trends in education and to refine existing programs
 
in accordance with current research. Annually, 
student
-
assessment results and input from the School
-
Based Coordinated Program (SBCP) Needs Assessment Survey identifies staff
-
development 
priorities and supports the goals for achievement of the School Site 
Plan (SSP). Long
-
range plans are drawn to provide continuity and differentiated 
instruction to ensure all students reach levels of proficiency or above.
 
 
Professional development is ongoing to ensure our staff keeps abreast of new learning strategies, inno
vative teaching techniques, and applied technology 
in the field of education. A monthly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as
 
an entire grade level.
 
 
An effective process for staff development and curricul
um improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrators. Topics relevant to 
the needs and priorities of the school are identified early in the year, and monthly staff
-
development sessions are scheduled accordingly. It should also 
be pointe
d out that CUSD offers a New Teacher Training Academy for beginning teachers. This is a two
-
year program targeted at five performance areas.
 
 
During the 2019
-
20 school year, Cedarwood staff is focusing on reading and math. In reading, teachers are receivin
g continued training on close reading 
strategies. In math, teachers are learning multiple ways to help students justify their answers and explain how to get their 
answers. Teachers are also 

 
are providing students strategies to help them solve math problems. These 
professional development opportunities are monthly. Teachers also use data to guide their instruction throughout the school y
ear.
 
 
The district focused all professional development 
activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the Common Core State and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III

ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
Schoo
l Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K

assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
