Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement is a welcome asset for the students and staff at Ranch Hills. The goal to provide opportunities of 
involvement is a priority and an area of pride. Ranch Hills is a community school. 
Parents are encouraged to volunteer 
through any number of avenues. Volunteer parents help in the classroom, the parent work center, annual Book Fairs, 
Holiday Craft Fair, volunteer on field trips, and provide support and leadership for educational and soci
al programs 
including our monthly school advisory committee parent seminar series.
 
 
Elected parents serve on the School Site Council, which focuses on the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA), budget 
and school program improvement priorities. The Eng
lish Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Advisory 
Committee (SAC) meets bi
-
monthly to monitor our English Language Learners program, student proficiency progress and 
budget concerns, and workshops for parents. The PTA Boards also meets monthly to 
support educational and social 
programs of the school.
 
 
We encourage parents to attend the Welcome Back assembly, Back to School Nights, Open House and family evening
