Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, whi
ch are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of
 
California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Del Rey staff recognizes the
 
importance of parent involvement in children's' education and continues to look for ways 
to increase the level of participation.  Classroom and school volunteers perform many activities to support teachers and 
students such as chaperoning field trips, cle
rical tasks, room parents, listening to students read, gallery
-
walks, school 
beautification, monthly participation on the School Site Council (SSC), and bi
-
monthly participation on the Site English 
Learner Advisory Council (SELAC), nutrition classes, famil
y literacy classes, and technology classes.  The 5th Grade Parent 
Committee works collaboratively to facilitate end of the year 5th grade events, which include 5th grade movie night, the 
As Game field trip, Wagon Train reenactment, and the 5th grade breakf
ast and yearbook signing.
 
 
Our dynamic PTA volunteers assist with school wide programs and activities such as hearing and vision screenings, picture 
day, Book Fair, Variety Show, fundraising, Common Core Family Night, craft night, family dance, and movie n
ights.  Parents 
are encouraged to attend PTA general membership meetings on the first Wednesday of each month.  We encourage all 
parents to be involved by attending school events including those listed above, Back to School Night, Title I Literacy Night,
 
O
pen House, parent conferences, and music performances.
 
 
For more information on how to become involved, contact your child's classroom teacher or Principal Don Carpenter at

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

At Del Rey we are continuing to implement SoulShoppe, which is a research based, social
-
emotional learning curriculum 
to help students increase agency and self mastery, to help students improve their relationships wit
h peers and family 
members, and to effectively manage the complexity of interpersonal as well as intrapersonal conflicts.  Additionally we 

te 
a strong common language and effective learning environment where children are empowered to make wise choices. This 
program provides a school climate that ensures a safe place to learn and the right of all children to enjoy the educational 
experience.  
A class and individual students are rewarded each week for their positive behavior.
 
 
There is an Emergency Operations command structure in place, and all staff have specific assignments in case of an 
emergency (such as first aid, search and rescue, emergen
cy student dismissal, food/shelter, and safety).  A flow chart of 
assigned duties and a description of duties has been distributed to all staff.  Each teacher has an emergency backpack in 
his or her classroom with special survival supplies.
 
 
Throughout the
 
year, the staff receives disaster preparedness training.  In addition, monthly safety drills for duck and 
cover, evacuation, lock
-
down, and shelter
-
in
-
place are scheduled and rehearsed each month.  The knowledge gained from 
our training, research, and dri
lls has been incorporated into the School Safety Plan. This plan includes information about 
child abuse reporting, sexual harassment policy, dress code policy, the Del Rey School Code of Conduct, and the District
-
Wide Safety Plan, as well as disaster prepa
redness. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review by 
contacting the principal.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was most recently reviewed, updated, and discussed with school faculty and the 
Del Rey School Site Council in 
September, 2019.

Del Rey is committed to differentiated, highly engaging 
instruction that is standards based.  All teachers participate in 
ongoing site
-
based professional development and have the opportunity to improve their skills by taking college courses, 

-
services or other 
workshops offered by the County Office of Education 
or other organizations. Teachers also have opportunities to attend professional conferences supported by site and/or 
District funding.   All teachers participate in ongoing Balanced Literacy professional 
development.  Teachers are receiving 
support in Writer's Workshop model instruction.  Teachers of primary grade students are participating in the language 
development and enrichment professional development, SEAL.  All teachers are also participating in pr
ofessional 
development on Restorative Practices, and the implementation of culturally relevant teaching strategies.  All teachers 
participate in professional development and participate in coaching/collaboration with  site and district Common Core 
coaches.
  
Since the integration of technology is important to student success, teachers also have access to technology 

 
such as Chromebooks
 
and the use of Google Apps for Education.  As we strive to meet the evolving academic and social 
emotional learning needs of our students at Del Rey, staff participate in site and district professional development on 
designated and integrated English Lang
uage Development (ELD), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), restorative 
practices, and equity.  We have a restorative practices lead teacher that participates in professional development with 
district social workers and other restorative practices lead te
achers.
 
 
In addition to the above, staff have requested professional development on math, science, Universal Design for Learning, 
and on the utilization and implementation of the new Fountas and Pinnell literacy adoption.  Teachers receive professional 
dev
elopment during monthly staff meetings, and during half day professional development trainings (4
-
6/year) and during 
full day site and district facilitated professional development trainings (3
-
4/year).
