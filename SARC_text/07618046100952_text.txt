Principal's Message and Mission Statement
 
Bollinger Canyon Elementary School is a suburban PreK
-
5 school nestled in the rolling hills of the 
San Ramon Valley. Our city has rapidly grown from its rural roots to become the main headquarters 
for multinationa
l corporations, many of whom partner with Bollinger Canyon to expand learning 
opportunities for our students. Our neighborhood is home to people who desire to live in a family
-
oriented community where recreation and team sports, citizenship and scouts, aca
demic 
excellence and school are pivotal. Bollinger Canyon has a deep commitment to its families, which 
is reflected in a solid sense of community. In 2018 Bollinger Canyon Elementary achieved the 
distinction of becoming a California Distinguished School.  
We were given this award in 2014, as 
well, and in 2016 we were awarded the California Gold Ribbon and Academic Achievement Award.
 
 
Our Mission is to provide a safe and effective learning environment where academic excellence and 
individual differences are 
valued and encouraged.  It is our goal to promote collaboration between 
staff, parents, and students to achieve personal and academic excellence nurtured by a sense of 
teamwork, respect and trust. Teachers, students, parents, and staff understand the need 
for all 
members of our school community to feel encouraged, valued, and admired. There is a fervent 
desire to provide a learning environment that is conducive to developing the unique intellectual, 
social, physical and emotional potential of each child. Te
achers and parents have a clear 

are professionals who require rigor and stamina in their classrooms. They believe that high 
expectations are the right of every
 
child and not negotiable.
 
 
Bollinger Canyon Elementary is school that embraces the California State Standards. You will see 
evidence of higher level thinking taking place in every classroom related to English Language Arts, 
Math, Science and Social Studie
s.  We have a teacher leadership team called the Curriculum Team 
that meets monthly to discuss progress on Essential Standards, professional development 
opportunities and the general curriculum needs of our staff and students. Technology is 
incorporated th
roughout our school through the use of Chrome Books, iPads and our computer lab.  
Our teachers also embrace STEAM activities through our partnership with R.A.F.T. and our new 
Maker's Space.  All classrooms are equipped with document cameras and LCD project
ors.

We are also a school that values and acknowledges the social and emotional needs of our students.  If students do not feel sa
fe, welcomed 
and loved, they will not learn at high levels.  In 2016
-
2017, Bollinger Canyon implemented Positive Behavior Int
ervention Systems (PBIS). 
This program is a research
-
based school
-
wide behavioral support program that implements positive behavioral expectations and 
acknowledgement of those appropriate behaviors.  Bollinger continues to have a strong system that is used
 
by all staff and incorporates 
three simple rules:  Be Safe, Be Respectful and Be Responsible.  Students are recognized with Bulldog Bucks and Golden Bucks 
for their 
positive behavior in addition to participating in classroom
-
specific rewards systems.  We 
also have a Character Trait of the Month that is 
supported by a school
-
wide Book of the Month to support each character trait and the social/emotional benefits of living that character 
trait.  We have monthly Principal's Visits where the principal either r
eads a book or does a community circle to support the character trait 
for each month.  Our school psychologist offers Zones of Regulation lessons to all classes and reads follow up stories as nee
ded.  With the 
addition of the district's new social/emotiona
l curriculum called Sanford Harmony, we are utilizing community circles and buddy activities 
as a regular part of building classroom community.  We also have a teacher leadership team called the "PAWS Team" that meets 
monthly 
to discuss the social/emotiona
l needs of our school.
 
 
As we work to meet the academic and emotional needs of our students, we work hard to make sure there are interventions in pla
ce to 
support these needs.  We have grade
-
level paraeducators who work with small groups in reading, writin
g and math every single day.  We 
have Tier 2 supports in reading, Barton, Reading Recovery, and our Rainbow Room and SCIP Counseling, sponsored by the Discove
ry 
Center.  We have a teacher leadership team called the Intervention Team that meets monthly to d
iscuss student needs, current 
interventions and how best to support all students.  In addition to this team our Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams also meet monthly t
o monitor 
student data and progress.
 
 
One very unique program to our school is our Intensive Special 
Day Class (SDC) program, consisting of children from pre
-
school through 
5th grade who have been diagnosed with cognitive and behavioral challenges who are also on the autism spectrum.  General educ
ation 
students receive empathy and disability awareness tra
ining which helps them to engage with this special group of students while on 
campus, at lunch and on the playground.  Each grade level participates in monthly activities with their SDC peers and our SDC
 
students in 
grades 2 
-
 
5 participate in a weekly Spe
cial Buddy program led by our Physical Education (PE) teacher.  We have seen true friendships 
grow from this amazing program.
 
 
From the moment you step onto the Bollinger Canyon campus you will sense the strength of our community.  We value education a
nd 
s
upport the whole child in everything we do.  Bollinger students are unconditionally supported by dedicated teaching professio
nals, highly 
qualified support staff and a community of families who want nothing more than for Bollinger to be a rigorous and lovi
ng place for their 
children to call 'home'.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (S
ARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

calculated by taking the 
total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University
 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experie
nces are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team 
and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, in
tentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These co
horts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teache
rs are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our
 
Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the di
strict as a whole is enhanced.
