Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient ser
vice and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

ASSOCIATION (PTA) along with Dads Club: Lupine Hills has an active PTA and Dads Club of 
a very committed group of parent volunteers. The staff truly appreciates our wonderful group of parents. The Lupine Hills 
PTA works together with the school and aligns
 
with the school's goals and objectives. This partnership has proven to be 
an added value to our school! This has resulted in a closer relationship between the school and the community, which 
greatly benefits our students and families. Our PTA plans many c
ommunity activities throughout the school year. General 
PTA meetings are held approximately monthly. Our PTA works with our teacher liaisons and principal to ensure 
coordination and alignment.
 
 
Parents also participate as classroom volunteers, field trip d
rivers and/ or chaperones, and campus supervisors (all 
volunteers secure WCCUSD identification badges and are to follow established district protocol).
 
School Site Council (SSC) meetings are scheduled monthly. The SSC has five parent member positions who w
ork together 
with staff and the community in order to plan and monitor goals and budgetary decisions.
 
ELAC (English Learner Advisory Committee) gathers to advise on matters pertaining to students and families of English 
Learners.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose 
of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school 
staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those t
hat may occur without warning.

Lupine Hills Elementary continues to focus on two major areas of professional development for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year: positive school climate and the workshop model of instruction. Staff members have collaborated to
 
establish school
-
wide discipline procedures, norms, and expectations, focused on positive, preventative, proactive, and restorative 
practices. Roles, zones, and attention signals have been established for the cafeteria, play yard, and other common areas.
 
 
Teachers have also agreed to adopt Teachers College writing Program and are committed to a robust series of professional 
development opportunities in this area. These areas of PD focus were determined based on discipline data, ELA student 
performance, and
 
staff member desire to provide the best educational opportunities for our students.
 
 
Additional professional development is provided through regular collaboration between staff members, district and non
-
district conferences, the Teacher Induction Program,
 
additional mentoring opportunities, and coaching from the principal.
