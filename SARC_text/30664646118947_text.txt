By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our mission is to ensure all students become contributing mem
bers of society, empowered with skills and knowledge 
necessary to excel in a changing world.
 
 
Our vision is to instill the enjoyment of lifelong learning.
 
 
 
As of September 2001, Ladera Ranch became home to Chaparral Elementary School. Ladera Ranch also ho
lds the 


 
where every home is wired with full Internet access. 
Chaparral Elementary School capitalizes on this technological infrastructure with e
-
learning opportunities for all students.
 
 
Setting
 
high standards and expectations for all students, the Chaparral staff works with the students, parents, and 
community to offer a sound educational program that really works. The Chaparral staff is truly outstanding. Approximately 
800 students in preschool
 
through Grade 5 work with our staff of 26 general education classroom teachers. We believe in 
the importance of student acquisition of basic skills and the ability to use those skills in all subject areas, including lan
guage 
arts, math, science, social st
udies, and the arts. Special emphasis is placed on reading; writing, listening, speaking, critical 
thinking, problem
-
solving, and student work products because, ultimately, students need to communicate their 
knowledge with others. Chaparral connects people
 
to create a sense of community; connects the curriculum to achieve 
coherence; connects classrooms and resources to enrich the climate; and connects learning to life to build character. 
Chaparral promotes instantaneous e
-
learning with access to the Interne
t and web
-
based research for real
-
time learning.
 
 
At Chaparral School, both students and teachers use a variety of technological resources as tools to increase student 
learning throughout all areas of the curriculum in an exciting, dynamic environment. Stu
dents use e
-
tools to produce 
quality work products and presentations. The third, fourth, and fifth grade classrooms have one
-
to
-
one Chromebook 
devices.  Students in grades K
-
2 have access to Dell computers in the lab and Chromebook devices to share in the 
classrooms. Students use the devices in a wide variety of ways, including: writing, editing, revising, making presentations, 
Internet research, learning how to type, etc. Chaparral Elementary School promotes strong parent, community, and 
business involveme
nt. This takes the form of continual school
-
home communication, parent volunteers, a great PTA, 
community volunteers, an on
-
campus YMCA for before
-
 
and after
-
school child care, plus the active seeking of donations 
and business partnerships. In essence, Cha
parral Elementary builds a strong sense of community 

 
a place where 
everyone comes together to promote teaching and learning. Character education and community service are important 
aspects of what we do and what we stand for at Chaparral. The 3
-

r Character Education Program are to be: 
Respectful, Responsible, and Ready to Learn.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and strategies to promote continuous learning of adults 
that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engage students in meaningful, challenging, and innovativ
e educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The visi
on 
for GFI is that all learning environments includ
e Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is multi
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
w
ide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 

lemental training during the summer and after 
school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to improve educator effectiveness in order to increase 
student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instructional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide 
specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpose of this 
time is for educators to examine the impac
t of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for 
professional learning and set annual measurable goa
ls based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines pr
iorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the examination of meaningful formative and summative ass
essment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

ze Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  These embedded professional learning activities 
help pre
pare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching within the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists 
new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing and meets the re

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through their participation in school site learning teams, st
udent study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
