Like the roaring '20s, our district is poised to make some noise in 2020!
 
LEUSD student accountability showed meaningful gains with the latest California School Dashboard 
results. Positive growth in 

focus on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to provide teachers and principals with critical 
performance data to guide daily instruction, helping students succeed!
 
 

 
first new school in 12 years is greatly anticipated. Alberhill Elementary School will 
open in August of 2020. This new TK
-
5 school will feature state
-
of
-
the
-
art solar energy efficiency, 
flexible classroom furniture and configurable classroom space, exciti
ng classroom technology, and 
advanced campus security systems.
 
 
Recent facilities projects funded by the recent Measure V school bond include flexible classroom 
furniture, artificial turf replacement, playground refurbishment, LED lighting conversions, and
 
classroom technology purchases. Grant funded CTE program expansion will significantly update our 
existing engineering, agriculture, and medical career pathways. All LEUSD high school performing 
arts centers have recently received state
-
of
-
the
-
art sound an
d lighting upgrades, and new theater 
seating plus stage refurbishments are coming next.
 
 
A previously shuttered campus in Wildomar, Jean Hayman Elementary, was reopened this summer 
under a new development plan that will unfold over the next five years. Pha
se 1 tenant 
improvements were recently completed to accommodate the Southern California EMS Training 
Institute. Phase 2 will include refurbishment of the existing multipurpose room for professional 
development, staff training, community meeting rooms, and 
expanded parking. Phases 3 and 4 
include the relocation of existing adult education programs, new site
-
based child care, plus 
separate parking. Phase 5 will complete the relocation of our existing Adult Transition Program; 
also, installation of affordable 
housing for teachers as an incentivized recruitment strategy, 
enabling LEUSD to stay competitive in a statewide teacher shortage.
 
 
As you can see, 2020 and the beginning of a new decade has plenty for everyone to shout about!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Doug Kimberly,
 
Superintendent

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Lake Elsinore Unified School District (LEUSD) is committed to maintaining a safe, secure, and aesthetically pleasing envi
ronment for our students. 
The LEUSD Governing Board has adopted cle
aning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is
 
available at the school office and at the District Office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop clea
ning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. 
In addition to District
-
level support of routine and periodic maintenance needs, LEUSD holds high standards for cleanliness, appearance, 
and good repair of all campuses daily and maintains them through the efforts of the students, staff, day custodian, eve
ning custodial crew, and District 
Maintenance Department. Our maintenance staff ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a 
timely manner.
 
 
A work
-
order process is used to ensure efficient service an
d that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. LEUSD regularly assesses maintenance, 
modernization, and new construction needs. Any pesticide use at our school sites is in compliance with the Healthy Schools Ac
t of 2000.
 
 
Fire drill evacuations a
re conducted on a monthly basis at all elementary and middle schools, and twice a year at the high schools in the District. A
 
fire 
safety inspection is conducted once each year by the Riverside County Fire Department, while site personnel conduct site insp
ections on a regular basis.
 
 

ementary school and middle 
school, and once each semester at the high schools.
 
 
Currently, the Distric
t provides storage areas for emergency supplies to be kept on campus in the event of a disaster. A radio communication system
 
allows for continuous communication with the District office in the event of a disaster.
 
 
A Crisis Intervention Team has been iden
tified and trained to deal with stress experienced by students and staff as a result of a crisis situation. Team 
members are called upon to assist across the District as necessary. As part of the comprehensive School Safety Program, Schoo
l Resource Officer
s provide 
prevention and intervention procedures on all LEUSD campuses at least part time.
 
 
Our school was built in 2002. It has 27 regular classrooms, seven portables, a library, a multipurpose room, and eight specia
l education rooms. The 
designed capacit
y of the school is 1,300 students. Outside courts and fields.
 
 
A progressive discipline plan is in place and multiple discipline and Positive Behavior Intervention Strategies (PBIS) assemb
lies are conducted throughout 
the year. Four campus supervisors and 
a part
-
time School Resource Officer also help maintain a safe environment. The WE TIP program is utilized so that 
students may report crime anonymously and all leads are followed up immediately.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the
 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eli
gible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

School Safety Plan
 
Our School Safety Plan was reviewed by our School Site Council October 23, 2019, and updates were sent for review to our Gove
rning Board
 
in October, 
2019. The School Safety Plan was last reviewed and discussed with the school faculty October 23, 2019. The Safe School Plan (
SSP) is updated annually 
at each site to address components that the site will proactively seek to improve as it relat
es to student and staff safety. The SSP is available to the public 
for review upon request.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan is fully incorporated in the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and includes data regarding safe school procedures, 
and complia
nce with laws including: (1) child abuse reporting, (2) disaster response and crisis intervention, (3) suspension and expulsi
on policies, (4) 
notification of teachers of dangerous pupils, (5) sexual harassment, (6) schoolwide dress codes prohibiting gang
-
r
elated apparel, (7) procedures for safe 
ingress and egress from school, (8) procedures to ensure a safe and orderly environment conducive to learning, and (9) rules 
and procedures on school 
discipline adopted pursuant to California Education Code Sections
