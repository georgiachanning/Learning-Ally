By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2018
 
 
San Juan 
Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of Cal
ifornia. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted
 
according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School B
oard by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the quality, cu
rrency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In
 
July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Charles Peck, originally constructed in 1961, was modernized during the 2000
-
2001 school year.  Currently, there is 
sufficient space to house the student population.  Site custodial staff clean the b
uildings along with district support for 
major/minor repairs.  The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular 
fire/emergency drills are held, and badges are required for all visitors and personnel. In 2009, the entire
 
school had the 
exterior painted through Deferred Maintenance Funding.  Using Measure J funds, a site
-
wide landscape and irrigation 
project was completed Winter 2013.  This included ornamental fencing, sidewalks and ramps, storm drains and sewer 
lines, gra
ss, plants and trees.  All restrooms site
-
wide are being reconfigured and renovated using Measure J funds.  This 
project is scheduled for completion January 2014.  It includes all plumbing, fixtures, partitions, floors, walls, path of tra
vel 
and upgrades t
o meet ADA requirements.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenanc
e 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in August 2019 and 
determined that there w
ere no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to
 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets 
the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the distr
ict's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, ai
r conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

fficers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
