About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district convenes a committee to provide input and feedback in the textbook adoption process.  T
he committee meets the year prior to the adoption 
in order to review State adopted material.  They complete an exhaustive process to review and evaluate the adopted material. 
 
They compare the 
curriculum to state and district standards and complete an eval
uation of the extent to which the material covers each standard.  The committee provides 
information to teachers and prepares a short list of publishers to consider for adoption.  Publishers then send samples to th
e district in order to have 
teachers, admi
nistrators, and parents provide input.  The material is selected based on teacher, administration, and parent input.  The cho
ice is put 
before the School Board and upon approval adopted by the district.

developed by the State of 
California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

ht in the Fall and Family 
Fun Night in the Spring. Bridge to Technology parent workshops are held throughout the year to support families of English Le
arners with Chromebooks 
and internet access at home.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for par
ent involvement. Parents attend school functions and parent visitation days, participate in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteer in classrooms, assist as coaches, and chaperone field trips. Parents may also serve on advisor
y committees and leadership 
team
s, including the Parent Teacher Club (PTC), English Learner Advisory Council (ELAC), GATE Advisory Committee, and School Site

Home and school communication is enhanced through weekly notices, monthly newsletters, parent/teacher conferences,
 
the student/parent handbook, 
the school website, student report cards, and other regular communication activities, including school messenger, remind text
 
messages and class dojo.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Great Western Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the c
ampus is monitored by 
assigned staff. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus. 
All gates are locked and remained locked during 
school hours with the exception of the front gate which remains closed and latched during school hours.
 
 
The comprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emerg
ency response efforts, and maintaining a safe 
school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques
, evaluation of physical 
facilities, and communication with staff and students. Compo
nents of the plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, procedures for teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual ha
rassment policies, and 
suspension and expulsion
 
policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. Th
e 
plan was last reviewed/updated and reviewed with staff in October 2019.  An updated copy is available to the public at the sc
hoo
l office.
 
 
The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring the safety of students and staff during a disaster. Emerg
ency preparedness drills are 
conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.
