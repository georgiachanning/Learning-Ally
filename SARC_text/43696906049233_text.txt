School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lakewood TECH EQ was launched as a program of choice in 2015 to meet the changing needs of students and parents in 
today's digital world. With a focus on teaching students how to create digital content, our program empowers student 
voice while building awareness of one's digital footprint. Lakewood's Google certified educators continuously plan and 
support each other to integrate media and tech
-
use into students' learning. We start with a strong focus on building social 
emotional com
petencies, culminating in various opportunities to help, present, perform, and to lead. We extend students' 
emotional intelligence by providing them with opportunities to collaborate, create, and communicate in a safe "digital 
sandbox" where they learn pro
ductive technology skills while practicing and reflecting on their own cyber citizenship and 
online identity.
 
 
Our school is centrally located in Silicon Valley, adjacent to Lakewood Park, a favorite family destination for water play, 
playgrounds, and barb
ecues.  Situated in an ethnically and linguistically diverse neighborhood in Sunnyvale, the strong 
sense of community here is core to our students' engagement and learning.  Many Lakewood families have had children 
and grandchildren attend the school, shar

parents and students work closely together to shape our students' academic and online identities in order to positively 
impact their future.
 
 
The mission of Lakewood School is to inst
ill in our students high standards for academic achievement, integrity, leadership, 
and responsible citizenship in a digital age.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Lakewood Elementary was modernized in between 2014 and 2015, completing a 14 month whole school modernization 
which included all classrooms, playgrounds, the multi
-
use room, and cafeteria. This was in addition to the previously 
renovated office and library
 
and lab. As part of the most recent project, 11 new classrooms were built to replace portable 
classrooms, and all existing classrooms were fully updated. Lakewood is safe, clean and all systems are functioning.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Lakewood values the partnership between our community and school.  Our school's Parent Teacher Association puts on 
fundraising events that are aimed at bringing families together to build relationships, connections, and support for our 
students.  Family me
mbers also lead activities such as Project Cornerstone's Asset Building Champions (ABC) Reader 
program.  Parent representatives serve on our School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).  ELAC 
is facilitated by our Outreach Coordinator
 
and Assistant Principal, who are building strong ties to the school and 
surrounding community.  Monthly Principal's Coffees help to keep the dialogue and communication open between our 
parents and our school.  We believe that maintaining a school communit
y that values the voices and participation of our 
students' families helps us maximize the potential of our students.

Teachers participate in three full days of professional development during the school year.  In addition, monthly teacher 
learning days, when students are released early, provide additional time for focused professional development.  Finally, 
all teachers 
participate in district
-
wide grade level meetings focused on instructional practices three times a year.  The 
principal, district coaches and our site instructional coaches work with teachers to model and plan lessons, and teachers 
are encouraged to observ
e their colleagues to improve their instructional practice.  Teachers meet with the principal three 
times a year to discuss student progress.  Grade level teams are supported in seeking and participating in professional 
development designed to support inst
ructional planning and progress monitoring.
 
 
All professional development is tied to our school goals. Recent professional development activities include:
 
 
Curriculum Mapping California Common Core Standards
 
Data monitoring and targeted instruction through
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 
English Language Development for Content Areas
 
Using technology tools for collaboration
 
 
Foundations of Early Literacy
 
Reading comprehension through guided reading, interactive read alouds, and reading mini lessons
 
Leveled Literacy Intervention for targeted reading instruction
 
Authentic and rigorous writing instruction through Writer's Workshop
 
 
Embedding growth mindset and collaboration in mathematics instruction
 
Social Emotional supports for students
