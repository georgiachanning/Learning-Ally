Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is a top 
priority with the students and staff at Virginia Parks Elementary School.  The Safety Plan is rewritten each 
year by staff, student, and parent input.  The plan was presented to the BLAST Communication team on October 8th and 
presented and approved by the 

comprehensive safety plan with the addition of our Safe & Civil Schools Plan, including our BLAST component. We have 
an active site team that has continued participation in PBIS and
 
Restoritive Behavior Practices.  This component has added 
another level to our site plan that includes the identified areas of a comprehensive safety plan.  We continue to have 
Panther Patrol at the One main crosswalks and a flashing sign for safety on Mo
ffett Rd.  We continue to monitor our drop 
off and pick up procedures to ensure safety for our students.  The campus is well maintained and the custodial staff takes 
pride in their clean and safe environment.  We review this plan annually and present to SS
C and BLAST Communication 
team.

Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for 
staff. Twice monthly are collaboration meeting times during 
their school day, for teachers to collaborate, learn strategies, and develop action plans to meet identified student needs.  
Staff attend conferences during the school year, after school and durin
g the summer.
 
 
In addition, teachers have weekly scheduled grade level and staff meetings  with a set agenda.  Topics discussed include 
EL teaching strategies, planning for the differentiated instruction time, technology, curriculum, analyzing data, and 
pl
anning grade level curriculum and activities. Our site also have one Panther Pride collaboration sessions and one early 
release day a month.  This collaboration time is designed for grade levels to develop common core lesson plans and 
common formative asse
ssments used to assess student learning.  There are three School Leadership Teams, referred to 

a bi
-
monthly basis to discuss issues related t
o discipline, school climate, safety,student incentives (etc.), and the 
instructional team which is composed of instructional leaders from each grade level meet monthly and assist with the site 
educational and budget decisions.
 
 
The district participates i
n Induction through Ceres Unified School District and SCOE and other county and state approved 
formal training programs dedicated to improving teacher quality.  In addition, the district fully supports classroom teachers
 
with a cadre of full time staff dev
eloper/coaches who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and strategies.
 
 
School sites must include a professional development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include 
attendance at summer institutes, after school or Sa
turday workshops, teacher release days to attend conferences, and 
grade level  release days for in depth professional development.  All professional development is aligned to the district 
strategic plan.  The goal of all professional development is to incr
ease student achievement.
