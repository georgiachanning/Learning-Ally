School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

children from all backgrounds excel. Imagine a school that treats all children as gifted, building on their
 
strengths by 
integrating technology, garden, music, library and art into the core subjects. Imagine a school that does this in both Englis
h 
and Spanish. Imagine a school in which all members of the school community contribute to the vision of their ideal 
school 
and in which they collaborate to achieve that dream. Imagine a school where ideas count and where students are educated 
for success in a global society. Let your imagination go as far as it can, and you have discovered Flowery School.
 
 
Our Mission
 
 
Flowery School will foster students who:
 

 
have strong literacy skills and are capable of reaching high academic standards;

are responsib
le citizens who have the necessary skills to live cooperatively in a diverse world;
 

 
will have the opportunity to acquire a second language.
 
All members of the Flowery community 

 
parents, staff, neighbors and students 
-
 
collaborate in creating 
program choices 
to respond to student need.
 
 
Our Core Values:

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council (SSC), which always includes parent members, approves our annual action plan and expenditures. 
The English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) helps parents whose students are learning English feel welcome at our 
school. This group a
lso provides input on student learning needs as we continually strive to improve our program. Another 
important support group is the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). The PTO provides funds for field trips, teacher supplies, 
our ongoing Science in the Gar
den and Art programs. It also organizes such community events as the Halloween Carnival 
and Salsa Party. Parents also support our 20
-
year
-
old community garden. Our teachers are always looking for volunteers 
for the classroom, on field trips and supporting 
the organization of our community events. We welcome all parents and 
community members who want to help our students.

School Safety Plan was updated and approved in November 2018.  Staff members and noon supervisors patrol the 
playgrounds at recess and lun
ch.  Emergency and disaster procedures were reviewed at the start of the school year.  All 
teachers have copies of the playground guidelines and share them with students at the beginning of the year. Our monthly 
safety drills include fire, earthquake, and 
lockdown. The Larson Park gate is locked during school hours. All visitors and 
volunteers check in at the office before proceeding to classrooms. Regular volunteers have permanent badges provided 
by teachers.
