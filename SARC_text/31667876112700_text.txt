Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
10/17
 
 
Auburn Union Elementary School District held a Public 
Hearing on September 9, 2015, and determined that each school 
within the district had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant 
to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students,
 
including English Language Learners (ELL), are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted accord
ing to a cycle developed by the 
California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials 
approved for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by
 
a 
selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent 
examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information (as of January 2020) about the quality, 
currency, and av
ailability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement is an integral
 
part of the Auburn Elementary School culture and many parents serve a role in our 
School Site Council (SSC) and/or Parent Teacher Club (PTC), as well there are plenty of additional opportunities to gain 
involvement in one of the numerous programs, such as
 
the Art Docent program, Passport to Reading program, Mileage 
Club, Sight Word Busters, Panther Patch and regular volunteering in classrooms.
 
 
The Auburn community and community service clubs support the school through grants, donations, assemblies, and 
vo
lunteering services.
 
 
We also support students by collaborating with outside agencies. Placer County Office of Education, SMART, ACCESS, Kids 
First, Wellness Together, and other community agencies provide additional support for students needing services no
t 
available at Auburn Elementary School. Auburn Elementary School works closely with the Placer County Sheriff's 
Department, the fire department, and other community agencies to ensure the safety of all students, staff and parents 
on campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Auburn Elementary School. The school is always in compliance 
with all laws, rules, and 
regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site 
Safety plan was last reviewed and updated in January 2018 by the School Safety Committee and School Site Council. All 
revisions were communicated to both the clas

steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lock
-
down drills are conducted on a regular 
basis throughout the school year. During school h
ours, all visitors and volunteers sign in at the office and wear 
identification while on campus; this includes morning arrival and afternoon dismissal times. All staff members are required 
to wear picture
-
ID cards and teachers are directed to keep classroo
m doors locked throughout the school day. Staff 
provides supervision before, during and after school to assist with the safety of our students.
