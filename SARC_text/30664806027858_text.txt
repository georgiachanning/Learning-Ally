Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.
