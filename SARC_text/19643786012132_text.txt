School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are multiple ways in which parents are welcome to, and encouraged to volunteer here at Washington. Help in the 
classrooms, library, parking lot or even the office is welcome! We are successful in large part from the efforts and 
dedication from our vo
lunteers on a daily basis. We also give credit to our PTA. This organized parent group has monthly 
meetings with elected board members as well as open meetings several times yearly. These parents organize fundraisers 
as well as activities and field trips. 
Our School Site Council is also another key component to our school site. This elected 
board has the great task of planning our fiscal year of categorical funding to align with our standards and curriculum; as 
well as the concrete needs of the school.  Ano
ther Parent team is our English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).  This 
group discusses present concerns of our English Learner population as well as upcoming educational focus for or EL 
students. These teams meet several times throughout the year.

drills, earthquake drills, and intruder drills. We also participate in the statewide drill "The Great Shake Out." Students an
d 
staff prepar
e for this elaborate practice drill with mock scenarios. The staff then gives input on the drill and the Safety 
Team meets to review and alter our plan as needed.  Additionally our parents are invited to a Safety Night which focuses 
on informing our parent
 
population of Washington safety practices and bringing an awareness to social media safety.

The state dashboard and SBAC results were used to identify areas of strength and weakness in looking at professional 
development on the Washington campus.  With weakness in special populations (ex. special educaiton, English learners)

focus came in the form of:
 
 

 
Staff development has focused on using data to plan for intervention and instruction.
 

 
Teachers have met for trimesterly data days 
in which the recent benchmark data has been analyzed and next 
steps for tier 3 instruction for those identified are planned.
 

 
SST protocols have been put in place to support both behavior and academic concerns.
