Established
 
in
 
2018,
 
JCS-Cedar
 
Cove
 
is
 
a
 
parent-choice
 
charter
 
school
 
where
 
the
 
community
 
is
 
the
 
classroom.
 
The
 
school™s
 
purpose
 
is
 
to
 
help
 
students
 
discover
 
their
 
educational
 
passions
 
and
 
become
 
independent,
 
self-
 
directed,
 
lifelong
 
learners.
 
JCS-Cedar
 
Cove
 
serves
 
grades
 
TK-12
 
with
 
a
 
target
 
student
 
population
 
for
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
to
 
home
 
school
 
or
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
a
 
home
 
school
 
hybrid
 
and
 
collegiate
 
learning
 
model
 
with
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
classroom
 
learning
 
opportunities
 
four-days-a-week
 
and
 
one
 
day
 
at
 
home
 
for
 
independent
 
study.
 
We
 
challenge
 
each
 
child
 
to
 
achieve
 
academic
 
and
 
personal
 
success
 
in
 
a
 
nurturing
 
environment.
 
 
At
 
JCS-Cedar
 
Cove,
 
we
 
believe
 
that
 
every
 
child
 
is
 
unique,
 
precious
 
and
 
is
 
worthy
 
of
 
celebrating!
  
We
 
believe
 
that
 
each
 
child
 
deserves
 
a
 
high-quality
 
education
 
from
 
highly-trained
 
and
 
masterful
 
teachers.
 
At
 
JCS-Cedar
 
Cove,
 
teachers
 
and
 
other
 
staff
 
members
 
make
 
it
 
their
 
mission
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
know
 
each
 
child™s
 
special
 
talents,
 
learning
 
styles,
 
strengths,
 
and
 
needs.
 
 
Through
 
continual
 
and
 
varied
 
means
 
of
 
assessment,
 
teachers
 
strive
 
to
 
tailor
 
their
 
instruction
 
to
 
provide
 
each
 
student
 
with
 
the
 
most
 
appropriate
 
learning
 
experiences.
 
JCS-Cedar
 
Cove
 
Academy
 
teachers
 
design
 
differentiated
 
learning
 
centers
 
that
 
allow
 
children
 
choice
 
and
 
experiential
 
practice,
 
and
 
the
 
students
 
have
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
carry
 
out
 
a
 
wide
 
variety
 
of
 
engaging
 
projects
 
throughout
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
Students
 
learn
 
to
 
collaborate,
 
think
 
critically
 
and
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
world
 
around
 
them
 
as
 
they
 
gain
 
independence
 
and
 
responsibility
 
within
 
a
 
loving
 
community.

Because
 
JCS-Cedar

is
 
an
 
independent
 
study
 
program,
 
parental
 
involvement
 
is
 
welcome
 
and
 
very
 
much

Parents
 
and
 
students
 
participate
 
in

We
 
have
 
multiple
 
field

which

that

Other
 
examples
 
of
 
involvement
 
include
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
daily/weekly
 
teaching
 
of
 
their

opportunities
 
to
 
serve
 
on
 
the

monthly

with
 
an

In
