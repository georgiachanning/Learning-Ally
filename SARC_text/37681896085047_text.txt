School Description
 
Tierra del Sol (TdS) is located in eastern Lakeside.  We are a school of over 750 learners and our 
goal is to make each day a day of le
arning for each child.
 
 
Students at TdS have access to fantastic core curriculum teachers in Math, Science, English, Social 
Studies, and PE.  Our school also has strong elective programs as well, including ASB (student 
leadership), drama, band, 
percussion, art, technology, yearbook, and ceramics. Our school is proud 
to continue the Project Lead the Way Middle School Gateway program, with all nine classes being 
offered by 2019
-
2020! TdS is also proud to have over 200 Spanish and Mandarin Immersion
 
students this year!
 
 
We have many programs to assist students with academic and/or behavioral issues.  We know that 
many students need supports to be successful, and our goal is that every child can find success in 
middle school and beyond.
 
 
Tierra del 
Sol's vision centers around our motto, "Every Student, Every Day".
 
 
Every student is an integral part of an innovative learning community, focused around science, 
technology, engineering, mathematics, and the arts.  All TdS students will have equitable acc
ess to 
a high quality STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) and Immersion education that 
embraces the 4 C's 
-
 
Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Creativity 
-
 
which are the 
super skills for the 21st century that will prepare
 
students to succeed in a world in which they can 
yet imagine.  Upon promotion, students from TdS will leave with an expectation for high 
achievement, respect for their school environment and their surrounding community.  Students 
will also leave with a li
fe
-
long learning attitude that provides a strong foundation to excel in any 
successful secondary institution, including those that promote a STEAM, Immersion, and/or college 
and career
-
readiness curriculum.  "Every Student, Every Day" is a creed that all s
takeholders, 
including administration, staff, parents, and students, will embrace and live by to facilitate the best 
learning environment throughout the school year.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required 
by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are
 
required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP
 
is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For
 
more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact
 
the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1972, our school is 47 years old.  The Lakeside Union School District Maintenance team does a wonderful job keeping 
our buildings and schools 
in good condition.  Tierra del Sol is a very clean school, including buildings and rest rooms.  Our schoo
l had a major upgrade in the summer of 2013.   New 
air conditioners were added, as well as paint, concrete and much more.  We updated our main office as well! We are so excited
 
for you to come and visit 
our great campus!
 
 
To determine the condition of our 
facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

ou see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligib
le students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

We work to keep our parents connected at Tierra del Sol.  Our PTSA parents meet monthly, and parents also may volunteer on ca
mpus with a variety of 
different opportunities to help.
 
 
Parents support our school by volunteering a
t major events, helping support fund raisers and chaperoning at dances and field trips.  Regardless of your 

 
 
Parents may attend PTA meetings and School Site Council meetings each month.  Each meeting has a differe
nt role in helping support our students and 
their education.
 
 
We also look to reach out to parents and keep them connected in their child's school.  We use Jupiter Grades to report homewo
rk and grades, and email 
and/or call parents weekly via Illuminate to
 
keep them updated on school events and activities. Parents can also log into the Illuminate Parent Portal to 
check attendance, behavior, and grades.

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety is paramount at Tierra del Sol.  Our school and District work diligently to provide a safe environment for each studen
t each day.   We practice and 
drill for many different emergencies 
-
 
fire, earthquake, secure campus, lockdown.  We believe that pr
acticing will help prepare us if there was ever a real 
emergency on campus.
 
 
Our grounds are monitored by our Staff and our District maintenance responds immediately if any unsafe situations are found. 
 
Visitors must check in 
and out at the office.  Any adult on campus must display either a visitor badge, or a staff lanyard. This s
chool year we will be implementing Ident
-
a
-
kid 
on our school campus as an added safety measure.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan is revised every fall as we return to school.  We assign staff roles and practice emergency situations
 
throughout the year.
 
 
Key element
s of our plan include our evacuation areas and our secure campus procedures.  Based on our experiences, we try to practice fo
r the most 
likely events which are earthquakes and lockdowns.  Students and faculty review our plan and procedures as we practice t
hroughout the year.  Tierra del 
Sol is  a very safe school.
 
 
Our students can withstand a shelter in place for several hours as our school has three windowless buildings to safely house 
children in the event of an 
actual emergency.  Students have access to
 
water and restrooms within these B, C, and D buildings.

Each year, staff and administration meet to review data and develop our professional development plan for teachers.
 
 
Staff receive 
continuous professional development and feedback in regards to these three areas.
 
 
Our math instructors benefit from our District's partnership with Math Transformation.  Teachers meet monthly with their math
 
coaches to review 
curriculum and practice to be
st benefit students and help prepare them for success on the the annual SBAC assessments.
 
 
In addition, Principals in Lakeside work collaboratively in management Professional Learning Communities to determine best pr
actices to lead students 
to high levels 
of achievement.  Principals share these practices with staff and assist in monitoring and implementation throughout the schoo
l year.

SCIENCE 

 
 
The primary areas of focus for staff and administrator development have been related to
 
the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) 
and moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus areas include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling
 
up Professional Learning 
and Support to include all district teacher
s, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Collaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5) Addressing supplemental instructional materials.
 
 
Professional development needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs As
sessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Science Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedback data collected via prior professional learning events in the 
district.
 
 
Professional Learning, during the 2018
-
2019 schoo
l year, addressed all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and content training.  This occurred primarily through science lesson study for all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teach
ers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
Core Leadership Team and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training in the areas of Leadership, Facilitati
on of 
Professional Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation In
itiative Program.  

ning facilitated by their district Teacher Leader peers through 
the established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district PD days.
 
Other opportunities for science professional learning include supplemental material/planning work supp
orted by a CA Regional Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.
 
 
Administrator professional learning will address NGSS innovations, strategies to identify and support high quality science in
struction (ob
servations and 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both on site and through district management meetings via the Early Im
plementer Initiative.
 
 
Next Generation Science Standards Teacher Leaders, Expansion Teachers, and administrators are
 
supported via NGSS Early Implementation Initiative 
Project Director, on
-
site Core Leadership Team members and/or Teacher Leaders.
 
 
MATH 

 
 
LUSD focused on mathematics as a professional development goal in response to low performance scores on the CAASPP a
nd to support teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.
 
 
Professional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways:  1) Workshops (after school, on professional grow
th days, and during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and 
small group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
Teachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and use of curriculum materials through: 1) Workshops focuse
d on the content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math conten
t they teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content and practice standards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on unit and lesson design with their curriculum materials (within school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
bot
h in one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning activities 
and receive additional training from a leadership perspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
Social
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus areas in the 19
-
20 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselors continue the work of supporting the social and emotional needs of stude
nts.   Two Behavior Speci
alists 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support students with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Last ye
ar, two MTSS Teachers on 
Special Assignment (TOSAs) were added to support the development of social/emotional/behavioral int
ervention systems at four of our Elementary sites.
 
 
Professional Development and Coaching have focused on Conscious Classroom Management strategies.  Conscious Classroom Teachin
g provides teachers 
with professional development and coaching on Tier I and II
 
behavioral strategies.  MTSS TOSAs are also available to coach on classroom management 
strategies and student behavior plans.
 
 
Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School District continues to support principal growth through Professional Development and has deep
ened our support of teacher leaders 
in the 2018
-
2019 school year. Teacher leaders (Facilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as conten
t support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Learning. The Facilitators, in turn, prov
ide on
-
site coaching to their respective staffs.

Types of Services Funded
 
We have several programs at our schools to provide support for 
students, both academically and behaviorally.
 
 
Many classroom teachers provide additional help or tutoring for students on an as
-
needed basis.  Parents can contact their children's teacher(s) to find 
out about specific days and/or times that this assistanc
e is available.  Students that continue to struggle in classes may be referred for a Student Study 
Team (SST) meeting through our Counselor, Mrs. Macias
-
Gonzalez.  Mrs. Macias
-
Gonzalez will call a meeting with the student, parent, and all teachers 
to discu
ss a plan for success.  Other monitor and assistance programs are our Jupiter Grades, Review 360, and Friday check
-
ins with the counselor.
 
 
Students are supported with behavior and positive decision
-
making in many ways at TdS.  We have periodic class discu
ssions, presentations by 
administrators, and assemblies that encourage positive behaviors. We also provide school wide Positive Behavior Intervention 
and Supports (PBIS) 
activities to all of our students at least once a week.  TdS students are encouraged t
o perform good deeds at their school and in their community.  Students 
learn about the power each individual has to make a positive contribution.
 
 
If a student continues to struggle behaviorally, we offer many different counseling supports.  These can be d
iscussed with our School Counselor, Mrs. 
Macias
-
Gonzalez.
