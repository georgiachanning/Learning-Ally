Burton C. Tiffany School is one of 46 schools and 3 independent charter schools in the Chula Vista 
Elementary School District. Tiffany School includes 30 classes, K
-
6, an SDC preschool, and three 
special day classes.  We opened up a kindergarten Dual Langu
age Immersion Program for the 2019
-

Our mission at Tiffany School is to provide an educational 
environment that encourages all students 
to achieve their full potential:
 

 
Instructional Excellence
 

 
Student Responsibility
 

 
Parent Support and Involvement
 
 
Shared Vision
 

 
in an 
environment where all stakeholders are valued and respected, where learning is a life
-
long process, 
and where we empower character development and celebrate cultural diversity. We take pride in 
our school and provide instruction based on clear acade
mic standards and high expectations. We 
believe that the learning and working environment should be safe and nurturing.
 
 
Students are provided with the tools and strategies to become proficient in English Language Arts,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school was built in 1975 and is characterized as a loft school.  In the summer of 2005 Tiffany School was remodeled.  The
 
entire infrastructure was 
remolded.
 
 
In the summer of 2011, a new fence was
 
built to enclose the Kindergarten play area. This space is now self
-
contained. Gates exists on both the north and 
south side for access.
 
 
In the summer of 2013, a new upper area parking lot for staff was constructed to alleviate traffic and parking concer
ns.
 
 
The custodian is responsible for on
-
going maintenance/inspection of school facilities including checking for loose items, leaks, unsafe equipment, 
plumbing problems, etc.
 
 
The school has adequate protection against slipping in hallways, adequate prote
ction against falls from recreational equipment, and landscape designs 
that prevent students from climbing to dangerous heights.
 
 
Children and playground supervisors are instructed on the proper usage of equipment.
 
 
Regular reports on school crime and 
safety data are made at public school board meetings, and school advisory meetings will be supported.
 
 
We continue to update our computer lab with the best available technology on a yearly basis.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  We encourage 
parents to become actively involved in our school.  
We have Coffee with the Principal events to keep parents informed about assessment, curriculum and instruction and we provide
 
parents with ways in 
which they can become partners with us in the education o
f their children.
 
 
Tiffany School had a very active Parent
-
Teacher Association during the 2019
-
20 school year with a high membership.  Our PTA sponsors many projects 
for the benefit and welfare of our children and the community and our PTA is well regarded
 
throughout Chula Vista and San Diego County.  Parent Janice 
Oani is our current PTA President.
 
 
Currently, parents and members of the community volunteer regularly.  Seven Tiffany School parents are members of the School 
Site Council and take 
an integral 
part in the development and implementation of the Tiffany Site Plan for Student Achievement.   Our English Language Acquisiti
on Committee 
(ELAC) meets monthly to discuss and become informed on policies and programs for our English Learners.  We offer "Fami
ly Reads" throughout the year 
where we invite parents to attend a short presentation and then read with their children during the instructional day.

School Safety Plan
 
Student 
safety and well
-
being is promoted by activities including emergency and earthquake preparedness drills. Provisions and supplies for emergency
 
evacuations have been obtained, and a comprehensive evaluation plan is in place. Consistent expectations communica
ted regularly promote student 
safety and good decision
-
making. The YMCA has a child care facility. In partnership with the City of Chula Vista, Tiffany has an after
-
school program called 
DASH, Dynamic After School Hours, which is designed to provide elemen
tary school children with a variety of structured, recreational activities in a safe 
after
-
school setting. Activities are designed to foster teamwork, athletic skills, positive attitudes and self
-
esteem. First
-
aid and CPR classes are offered to 
staff throu
gh the district, the American Heart Association, and the American Red Cross. An automated external defibrillator (AED) has be
en added and is 
located in the Multi
-
purpose Room. The school has adequate protection against slipping in hallways, adequate protec
tion against falls from recreational 
equipment, and landscape designs that prevent students from climbing to dangerous heights. Children and playground supervisor
s are instructed on the 
proper usage of equipment. Standard incident
-
reporting procedures are 
in place. This year we have added Peace Patrol to our playgrounds so that 
students may seek out other students to find peaceful resolutions to problems on the playground. The community will use the s
chool during off
-
hours 
with the use of permits submitted 
through "School Dude". After
-
school, evening, and weekend use of school facilities by community organizations, and 
athletic groups is encouraged. The School Site Council approved the School Safety Plan on October 15th of  2019. The Safe Sch

Each year, targeted professional improvement activities are provided for teachers, instructional aides, and other employees. 
Instructional support for 
staff development is provided by the

tions and 
Success Criteria. Grade level collaboration is also being utilized to analyze student performance. Staff training is deli
vered at staff meetings, district 
meetings, conferences and workshops. Staff is supported by grade level meetings, walkthroughs, principal feedback, and assess
ments.
 
 
Principal Cohort Group meetings and walkthroughs are another source of professional devel
opment for the staff. Together, the Principal Cohort Group 
provides objective feedback on the implementation of the Single Site Plan.  Teachers continue to work on the developing stand
ards based learning 
intentions and success criteria along with implement
ing social emotional learning.

20 school year, the staff will focus on students demonstrating deep understanding of source text through learning intentions 
and success 
criterial. We will also focus on strategies that will enable English Le
arners to meet standards in all areas. These include GLAD strategies as well as a lens
