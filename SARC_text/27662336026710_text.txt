About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC)
. The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP
), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Avai
lability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The District selects textbooks in a cooperative effort with the three schools in the District. During the year, a committee c
omposed of teachers and an 
administrator, examines all the 
State
-
approved textbooks in a content area. The textbooks are evaluated on their alignment with the county adopted 
toolkit, Common Core State Standards, their appropriateness for the District, their clarity, the teacher support materials, a
nd their instruc
tional appeal. 

 
 
Once the District adopts the textbook, each student receives a copy of the book. The District has affirmed that every studen
t has access to their own 
textbooks and instructional materials for use in the classroom and to take home. Additionally, new adoptions come with an onl
ine component that allow 
all students have access to from home. Online components include a digital stude
nt textbook, videos, and extra support for student learning as needed.

School Facility Conditions and Pla
nned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Washington Union Elementary School, which was originally built in the 1950s, underwent a modernization process in 2001
-
02 and 2004
-
05, thanks to 
the successful passage of a $13 million bond measure approved by the commu
nity in March of 2001. At the end of the modernization project, 100% of 
the classrooms on campus had been remodeled. All classrooms in the project received new heating and ventilation systems, carp
eting and flooring, and 
new paint. A new building was compl
eted in August 2005, which includes a computer lab, library, three additional classrooms, and boys and girls 
bathrooms.
 
 
Students attend school in a pleasant, updated environment, which includes internet access in every classroom, handicap access
 
to the 
entire campus, 
and contemporary design.
 
 
The library holds a collection of 7,500 books, or 39 books for each student on campus. Throughout the school, there is one Ch
rome Cart in each classroom, 
plus a set in the computer lab for supplemental use. The sc

track built with parent donations. New playground equipment was added in the 2014
-
15 school year, and was fully operational in the 2015
-
16 school 
year.  Over t
he summer of 2016, track was re
-
cut, baseball fields were cut to code, and the old track was filled in with sod. In the 2016
-
17 school year, 
Washington Union School had several plumbing issues, which were repaired over the summer to prevent further issues.
 
Upgrades and repairs to sections 
of roofing were completed in 2018
-
19 and during the summer of 2018 and 2019, half of the school has been repainted.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Students attend school in a safe environment. The District supplies supervisory staff for recess and lunch. Supp
ort staff members also 
monitor loading and unloading of the buses, and students participate in annual bus safety and evacuation drills. All staff ar
e trained on 
safety through Keenan learning.
 
 
 
 
The school maintains safety for students by having all visit
ors check in and out at the front office. Parent volunteers and other visitors 
wear identifying stickers/badges, identifying them as visitors to the campus. 
 
 
 
Washington Union Elementary School

s Safety Plan was last reviewed and modified in October of 20
19 and reflects accurate 
descriptions of room evacuation routes and persons responsible in times of emergencies. The plan includes procedures for 
emergencies, ranging from an active shooter on campus to an earthquake. School staff reviews the plan at the b
eginning of each year 
and reviews emergency procedures with the students. Monthly drills reinforce safe evacuation procedures. The emergency plan w
as 
approved by School Site Council in 
October of 2019
 
after revisions were made. 
 
 
 
Several school staff members, including the health aide, have received first aid training. Student emergencies are handled qu
ickly and 
appropriately. Parents are contacted immediately and, if necessary, 911 is called.
