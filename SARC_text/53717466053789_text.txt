About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the

concerns are noted and repairs undertaken as quickly as possible.  Schoo
l Safety Meetings are held during the school year to review the School Safety 
Plan, procedures, products used and discuss safety concerns of committee members.
 
 
In past years the District has secured funding to re
-
roof the classrooms, cafeteria and office 
buildings, and install energy saving light bulbs and motion 
sensors in all buildings.  The hot water heating system was modernized.  A new phone system/backbone was installed, included 
in this installation was a 
new school computer/data network.  In

additi
on, the District used ARRA and technology funds to upgrade and repair components of the school electrical 
system.
 
 
The School Site Council and School Board have developed a Lewiston Elementary School Facility Americans With Disabilities ACT
 
and Modernizati
on Plan.  
In the Plan ADA and modernization needs are identified, prioritized as well as funding sources to be used.  Currently, upper

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or 
programs of study

Over the last three years, staff development needs have been focused on use of 
technology such as smart boards, computers and computer instructional 
programs as well as direct instruction skills and student monitoring and motivation.  These areas were selected by staff as p
art of the yearly program and 
plan review process and regular
ly reviewed and sometimes modified at Teacher Meetings.  Professional development is delivered in a variety of ways 
including attendance at workshops, after school program workshops and classroom mentoring.  The district received a $25,000 g
rant to support
 
professional development in the 2018/2019 school year.  These funds will support professional development for the 2018/19 and
 
2019/20 school years.  
Professional development will also focus on behavior interventions such as Positive Behavior Interventions
 
and Supports as well as Response to 
Intervention strategies to improve academic performance across all grades and subgroups.
