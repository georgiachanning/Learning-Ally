By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Crestwood Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a 
safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To as
sist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the cond
ition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely mann
er.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in 
after hours for daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferr
ed Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heati
ng, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬¨rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Fa
cilities Improvements
 
During the 2017
-
18 school to accommodate preschool growth an portable building was added. A storage shed and cement 
sidewalks were added to preschool for playground safety. During the summer of 2017 three buildings, including the offi
ce, 
were updated with new roofing, and all blacktops were resealed.  During winter of 2019 a tree near the cafeteria was 
removed because of a safety issue, the old blacktop was removed, and cement was poured to provide a clean, safe eating 
area.  Flooring 
was replaced in room 66.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priorit
y: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Ca
lifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alter
nate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements fo
r entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Crestwood Elementary School continually 
strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by 
providing opportunities for parent participation i
n school activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning field trips. Parent
s 
may also serve on advisory committees and extra curricular teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learners 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), and School Site Council (SSC), Positive Behavior Committee, and track team. Parents are also 
encouraged to he
lp in the classrooms, and with school events. Additional opportunities for parental involvement also exist 
at the district level. Parents are invited to attend the PIQE classes, a series for parents giving strategies for students to
 
be 
successful learners,
 
and the School Smarts program offered every other year.
 
 
Crestwood's PTA is an active participant at Crestwood. They plan school activities including: "Parents and Pastries", Craft 
Night, Family Game Night, Movie Nights, and a yearly carnival.  The PTA al
so supports our literacy goals and provides 
incentives for promoting literacy school

nutrition lab.  The PTA also supports improvements at our site including an electronic marque
e, and are currently working 
to provide extra shelter outside of our cafeteria.

Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, twenty
 


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a
 
robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute whi
ch is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and coope
rative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with th
eir assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and 
assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and t
eachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Cre
dential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in 
the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
 
 
To support our goal of a positive climate and culture all staf
f members have been trained with the Flippen Group 
"Capturing Kid's Hearts".  Staff were initially trained with a two day in
-
service in the fall of 2017.  In February of 2018 a 
group of 20 staff members received additional training in "Process Champions" t
o serve as coaches to further the 
development of using the "Capturing Kid's Hearts" systems.  We met with a trainer on two traction days to evaluate the 
use of the strategies campus wide.  In October of 2018 all staff received "recharge" training of the pr
ocesses from previous 
training.  Crestwood will continue its use of "Capturing Kids Hearts" by moving to "Capturing Kid's Hearts 2" in the fall of 
2019.
 
 
In the 2017
-
18 school year all teachers received math training in common core standards from Tulare Co
unty Office of 
Education trainers.  Each grade level participated in learning how to best put all strands of Common Core together for an 
effective math program.  In the 2018
-
19 school year teachers used TOSA support to use this training with the new distri
ct 
benchmarks to create meaningful math experiences for students.  In the 2019 school year all teachers are receiving math 
training on four minimum days from our district TOSAs.  Topics include: Growth Mindset in Math, Number Sense, Problem 
Solving, and Pr
ocedural Fluency.  Teachers are then using the other two minimum days to unwrap standards in math and 
develop learning progressions and targets for each grade level.
