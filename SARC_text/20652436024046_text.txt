School Profile (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Sierra Vista Elementary is one of 28 
elementary/middle/comprehensive/alternative high schools in 
Madera Unified School District. During 2018
-
19, we had approximately 600 TK
-
6th grade students 
enrolled at Sierra Vista, with classes arranged on a traditional calendar.
 
 
Sierra Vista provided stu
dents and parents with student
-
friendly environment. We believe in 
engaging our parents in the education process. We have an on site Parent
 
 
Resource Center to assist parents with Citizenship, Parenting, and English classes. Also, we have an 
after school p
rogram to assist children in the areas of math, reading, science, technology, arts, and 
homework.
 
 

Language Development) is taught to our English learners for 
an average of 45 minutes a day. 
Students are grouped by their language levels so that instruction can be targeted towards their 
specific areas of need. The emphasis is on oral language, listening, reading, writing, and thinking. 
Teachers evaluate students 
three to four times a year and monitor their progress. The results of 
these assessments help teachers determine what skills need to be taught or reviewed with 
students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Av
ailability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or
 
science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in
 
the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by t
he state are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption
.
 
 
The table displays information collected in October, 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The main campus was built in 1952, with 
additional portables added over the years. Sierra Vista nowconsists of 35 classrooms, one State Preschool 
classroom, one SDC preschool, one Music/Band/PE classroom, one After school/Intervention classroom,a multipurpose room, a lib
rary,and 
administration o
ffices.
 
 
All of the classrooms are in good repair, as is evidenced by our yearly Facility Report.
 
 
The following chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection information. The chart displays data
 
collected in August, 2019.
 
 
Pla
yground space is adequate for the number of students we have, providing them with ample opportunity to be active during their
 
recess times. There 
is adequate space for staff to work with students. Sierra Vista has an excellent, but small, school library.

Cleaning Process
 
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of 3 fulltime employees to ensure that the school is maintained to provide
 
for a clean and safe school. 
They work a staggered shift schedule with one of them available on campus from 6:30
 
a.m. to 10 p.m. A three
-
person team from the district maintenance 
department services the larger maintenance needs about every six weeks. The district makes a great effort to ensure that all 
schools are clean, safe, and 
functional. To assist in this effor
t, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of School Construction. The 
district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is avai
lable at 
the district office for 
review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
On a regular basis, classrooms and facilities are inspected by the custodial staff and administration to identify needed clas
sroom repairs. District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessa
ry to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergency repairs.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
 
The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this i
ncludes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
