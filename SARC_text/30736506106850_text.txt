By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Meadow Park Elementary School is excited to be back on our original campus as we have just completed our Measur
e E 
remodel.  Having been away for one year this allowed us to have a renewed focus on how to make Meadow Park the best 
it can be in our never ending pursuit to have all of our students succeed.  As a kindergarten through sixth grade 
neighborhood school, w
e pride ourselves on being an academic and social community of learners as we exchange ideas, 
articulate with, and integrate our programs with adjacent South Lake Middle School, and four onsite Self
-
Contained 
Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) classroo
ms. Meadow Park is proud of the positive climate enjoyed by our students 
and staff. We have created an original, incentive based program that supports everyone having a positive and rewarding 
experience at school.
 
 
Meadow Park prides itself in following th
e R.O.P. E.S. Students and staff are Responsible, On time and ready, demonstrate 
a Positive attitude, Expect respect and always show Safety first. For the fourth year, Meadow Park embodies the true spirit 
of a PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Suppo
rts) school where we identify, teach, and reinforce expected behavior. 
Students receive ROPES coupons and are acknowledged for demonstrating these expected behaviors. Students are 
recognized each week during our Friday morning Flag Deck and each adult on o
ur campus has the opportunity to support 
and recognize students making positive decisions.
 
 
A powerful sense of professional community is also a hallmark of our school. We pride ourselves on being lifelong adult 
learners. We have developed a collaborative 
work culture and established norms along with ways to monitor and remain 
accountable for those norms. As a result, we strive to respect diversity, to be active listeners, to offer the best of oursel
ves 
to others, and to have fun. In this continued effort w
e have embraced Professional Learning Communities (PLC). This 
collaborative work culture provides the foundation for our universally embraced belief in participatory management. We 
strive to empower staff, parents, and students to become a vital part of th
e decision making processes, resulting in a 
pervasive feeling of school
-
wide ownership and cooperation.  The decisions of the teachers are data driven and based on 
both summative and formative assessments.  It is through our assessments that we provide ins
truction to meet the needs 
of all learners.
 
 
It is our mission to prepare all students to succeed in a changing world by becoming effective communicators, innovative 
problem solvers, capable individuals, and responsible members of society. Our commitment t
o grow professionally is 

Park School Community will create safe learning environments that develop intellectual risk taking to ensure th
at all 
students will achieve high levels of success academically, behaviorally, and socially through collaboration, collective 
commitments, critical thinking, and communication."
 
 
As we continue into the new year and what we have called "Meadow Park 3.0" m
any long range plans, programs and 
policies have already been established; however each of these remain in a state of constant modification, revision, and 
enhancement. In addition, new programs and procedures are constantly being reviewed, piloted, and inc
orporated into 
our program. By utilizing the most current research and resources, we are committed to providing the best possible 
education for every learner. As we look to the future, we also feel compelled to address the challenge of uplifting the 
public

communicating frequently and accurately, our successes and accomplishments will continue to be common knowledge.

We believe in the bond that exists w
ithin our school family of students, staff, and parents, which allows all of us the 
opportunity to grow and develop together. Our ultimate goal is to unlock within each child the ability to apply his or her 
thoughts and ideas in a responsible way that buil
ds a better future for us all.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Meadow Park moved to the El
 
Camino campus during the 2018/19 school year.  For one entire year Meadow Park was 
modernized and a new "Activity Center" was built for the 2019/20 school year.  The project was extensive and new space 
was not only added in regards to the Activity Center 
but the interior of the building created new offices for the 
administration, speech pathologists, three conferences room for the entire staff, occupational therapy office, adaptive PE 
room, innovation space, common working corridors, and new kitchen.  Ever
y room was upgraded "top to bottom" from 
new carpet/paint, air conditioning units, and technology which includes microphones for each teachers for students to be 
able to hear the teacher (and other students) more comfortably.  A new lighting and sound syst
em was also added into 
the multipurpose room.
 
 
Safety concerns are always paramount and in addition to everything being up to fire safety standards, we also received 
additional safety measures in regards cameras, lock down control system, and keyless entry
.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Meadow Park is a true 
community school. The partnership between home and school is paramount and each day parents 
are actively involved on our school campus.  Parents at the school participate in such activities as serving as room parents,
 
as classroom volunteers, assisting the
 
teacher with supervision during curricular field trips, and helping with special 
activities and events such as the Pancake Breakfast, Colonial Days, International Taste Festival, PTA and the Meadow Park 
Foundation. The PTA is very active at Meadow Park Sc
hool, supporting school programs and many extra activities for the 
children such as lunchtime activities, library books and materials, classroom supplies and activities, field trips, assemblie
s, 
and much more. The School Site Council  assist with decisions
 
to help improve school programs and student achievement.  
The Meadow Park Foundation also has become an important part of our success as they focus on the technology needs 
of our school and they most recently purchased both ipads and Chromebooks for our t
eachers and students.  Most recently 
for the 2019/20 we are excited to have our ELAC give us their insight on all things school related.    We welcome and 
encourage our parent community to become involved at Meadow Park School.  Most recently multiple pare
nts are now a 
part of the Meadow Park staff serving the roles of both lunchtime supervisors and as instructional aides.  The staff of 
Meadow Park is very grateful for the active involvement of our parent community.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We have an emphasis each year to ensure a safe environment for our children. Meadow Park has developed a 
comprehensive Safe School
 
Plan. Our plan is evaluated yearly and amended, as needed by the School Site Council and by 
the key leaders of the Emergency Preparedness Committee. We have focused this year on lockdown procedures with 
partnership from the Irvine Police Department as wel
l as planning a full disaster drill with student reunification.  In 
addition, monthly fire drills and a full simulation earthquake drill are scheduled and implemented throughout the school 
year to assess our level of preparedness. We have emergency supplie
s to prepare for a potential disaster. Staff is also 
trained and assigned to teams that would assist in a true emergency. These emergency supplies are kept in our Emergency 
Storage Shed and throughout the school for immediate access if needed. Our school i
s continually evaluating our 
procedures so we may be fully prepared to deal with a major emergency and to provide for the physical and emotional 
needs of the students and their orderly and safe release. We schedule regular drills to teach children appropri
ate safety 
actions in the event of an emergency.  Because of our medically fragile students special care is taken to ensure their safety
 
with the assistance of instructional aides, LVN's, and our school nurse.  Supervision is provided on the playground bef
ore 
and after school.  Having recently gone through the Measure E process and the modernization, Meadow Park has been is 
up to date on all things related to school safety.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was presented and passed by the School Site Council.  As we 
all agree, whether it is preparing for 
a scenario or something as simple as having a group of staff members knowing how to shut off utilities, the priority is 
always keeping our students safe.

place of more than 40 specific 
funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per

y depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induct
ion program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
co
aches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technolog
y matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain

Meadow Park School and the Irvine Unified School District are committed to continuous professional improvement. The 
District and site has staff development days, as well as afternoon and evening workshops
 
for teachers.  Targeted staff 
development activities are essential for maintaining and improving quality education. We continue to implement 
Response to Instruction which incorporates a variety of methods to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of 
each 
student. Integration of technology into the curriculum, implementing the Common Core, and collaboration amongst 
teachers, and  Professional Learning Communities continue to be areas of focus for professional development.  In the 
2017/18 school year, t
he District adopted a new Language Arts series and as a school site we have incorporated What Is 
Needed (WIN) time to assist with intervention for our struggling students.  This time also allows us to target instruction 
for all other students.   Additional
 
staff development this year has included a continued emphasis on PBIS, Thinking Maps, 
Common Core, and data analysis. Full Common Core implementation began in 2013 for Kindergarten and First grade.  In 
addition to PLC meetings and regular staff meetings, 
a PAC (Principal Advisory Council) comprised of grade level leaders 
and a representative from special education meet a minimum of one time per month with the principal to assist in the 
professional development plan.   IUSD worked with all grade levels in a
