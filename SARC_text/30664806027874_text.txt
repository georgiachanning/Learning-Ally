School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or 
programs 
of study.

Professional development is provided through a districtwide coaching model, 
Professional Learning Communities, staff 
meetings, teacher
-
principal meetings, districtwide minimum days, and districtwide professional development.
 
 
Priorities for training correlate with data analysis from multiple sources, indicating students' strengths
 
and needs.  In 
2016/17, professional development focused on Thinking Maps, Setting the Stage, and Write From the Beginning.  For the 
2017/18 school year, district
-
wide professional development days focused on Writing and Math. The focus of the 2018/19 
sch
ool year is English Language Arts.  Teachers receive on
-
going professional development to support the implementation 
of ELA standards through the adoption of the new Benchmark Advance program.  Continued support for Thinking Maps 
and Writing and their inte
gration with Benchmark was provided.
 
 
The districtwide coaching model has focused on using data to differentiate instruction.  Coaches also meet with grade
-
level teams to support the implementation of the Benchmark program and the use of data.  District ST
EM TOSA's provide 
support and training to teachers related to Next Generation Science Standards and STEM instructional modules. This 
includes in
-
class support and coaching.   Job
-
specific professional development occurs for other staff (speech therapists, 
instructional aides, special education staff members, etc.) during district meetings, minimum days, and district
-
wide 
professional development days.  In addition, specialists attend workshops, conferences, and receive support from our 
SELPA.
