Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

(School Year 2019Œ20)
Lincoln Elementary School™s Parent Involvement Program promotes the goal of improving student learning 
and achievement. Parent involvement activities provide parents opportunities to positively engage in their children™s 

education and to support their children™s learning. Parent involvement activities include:  The annual Title I meeting, 

Family Workshops held on topics determined by staff and parent input, and parent classroom volunteer programs. 

Parents are involved in annually reviewing school data, and in planning and revising programs for students and 

parents as part of the Single Plan for Student Achievement planning process. Important research-based information 

regarding home support is provided to parents monthly in our school™s newsletter, The Lion Link.
The Lincoln Learning Community Pledge that specifically defines school, parent and student responsibilities is 
distributed and discussed with parents at Back to School Night by each teacher and by the principal.
Parents are provided many opportunities to play an active role in their children™s education as classroom volun
-teers, as well as through PTA, School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Council, and EUSD committees such 

as DELAC, DAC, among others. We have many resources available in our designated Family Engagement Center 

... a room just for our most important partners - our students™ parents. Stop by!
