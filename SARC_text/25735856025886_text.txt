By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report
 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountabilit
y Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF o
r LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
p
rincipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
MODOC JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT MISSION STATEMENT
 
The mission of the Modoc Joint Unified School district is to providea quality education by leading, 
assisting, and motivating 
all students to establish and achieve goals to become responsible and productive citizens.
 
 
STATE LINE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MISSION STATEMENT
 
The mission of State Line Elementary School is to use shared decision
-
making by teachers,ad
ministrators, parents, and 
community members to provide a clean, caring, safe, and stimulatinglearning environment; and to develop the potential 
of every child so that each child can become asuccessful citizen with self
-
respect, critical thinking skills, a
nd an 
understanding of democratic ideals.
 
 
State Line Elementary School is located in New Pine Creek, on the border of California and Oregon. New Pine Creek is a 
rural town of approximately 250 people, and the main industry is farming and ranching. State L
ine Elementary School 
provides education for grades kindergarten through 5th in the Modoc Joint Unified School District. It serves children from 
the community of New Pine Creek. An interstate agreement with Lake County, Oregon, also allows Oregon students 
who 
live within one mile of the border, to attend our school. Our low student
-
teacher ratio creates opportunities for giving 
students extra help or more academic challenges. We use peer tutors and have weekly Little Buddy/Big Buddy activities. 
Students par
ticipate in, and enjoy, annual outdoor education experiences through field trips to the coast, high desert, 
science museums, and more.
 
 
Buildings: We provide instruction for students in an exceptional environment. The classroom hosts our daily small group,
 
whole group, and focused academic activities. The school has one large classroom, a multi
-
use room, and a library. The 
multi
-
use room is utilized as the cafe, V.A.P.A. (Visual and Performing Arts) program room, and technology lab. The library 
is housed in
 
a modular building adjacent to the main building.There are also adequate restroom facilities and a playground 
with a grassy area and modern, safe play equipment.
 
 
Library: Our library facilities are housed in a detached modular building. The library holds
 
approximately 1,500 volumes 
and is staffed to meet the weekly classroom schedule. Also available is a preschool and parent resource library.
 
 
Discipline: We implement positive and assertive discipline practices at our school. We inform parents of discipli
ne policies 
at the beginning of the year. The Big Buddy/Little Buddy program trains students to be positive role models. We follow 
the district procedures established for suspension and/or expulsion of students. Expulsion is the most serious 
consequence we
 
can impose. Expelled students can be removed from the school for the week, the semester, the year, or 
permanently.
 
 
Homework: Our teacher assigns homework four days a week. The primary teacher sends home a packet on Monday for 
students to complete during 
the week and return on Friday. The teacher also expects students to read, or be read to, for 
at least 30 minutes per night. Schedule: The school year includes 180 days of instruction. Classes begin at 7:54 a.m. and 
end at 2:00 p.m. On minimum days we excus
e students at 1:00 p.m.Breakfast is offered before school from 7:40 a.m. to 
7:54 a.m.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the Uni
versity of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Line Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students. The classrooms, playground, and facilities 
are inspected by the staff for safety once a month. We hold fire and 
lockdown drills monthly and earthquake drills 
quarterly. We hold intruder drills twice per year, or more frequently if advised. There is a telephone in every room. Once 
a year, the school undergoes an annual safety status evaluation. All staff has received
 
ALICE training.

work with the individual student.

Annually, MJUSD evaluates its annual Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP) focus items. From our LCAP goals, MJUSD 
determines our professional development goals based on the needs of our students so that we may ensure that our 
students achieve the highest levels of success.
 
 
All schools in the district 
plan teacher workshops accordingly in order to develop and implement their own focus, based 
upon the district plan. A Professional Learning Committee (PLC) has been implemented district
-
wide, with each school 
working in tandem to articulate goals and pract
ices. The focus is on student learning. Throughout the district, and at each 
site, teachers meet either with other grade level teachers or by department.
 
 
Site PLC meetings are held weekly and teachers analyze data from the past week, examine and assess st
udent work, and 
plan learning goals and assessments for the following week.
 
 

attendance at AVID Summer Institute and other conferences geared 
toward advancing teacher knowledge of how to help 
students meet or exceed state standards. Conference attendance is not limited to academics, as MJUSD endeavors to 
reach and teach the whole child; socially, emotionally, and academically.
 
 
Several conferenc
es that have been attended by faculty at MJUSD sites and include; Capturing Kids Hearts, ESTEEM 
(focused on integration of the Next Generation Science Standards), PBIS Conference, NGSS Phase 4 Roll
-
out, National 
Math Conference and trauma informed care and
 
instruction. Our CTE programs continue to grow with the addition of a 
plasma cutter and router at the high school level. Our CTE instructors attend regular trainings and workshops in order to 
stay up to

date on equipment and teaching methodologies and str
ategies.
