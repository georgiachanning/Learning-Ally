School Description
 
At Virginia Rocca Barton School, student academic achievement and safety are the number one 
priority, and all students are expected to come to school ready to learn. Everyone at our school is 
taught to respect one another and is expected to take part in the Positive Behavioral Interventions 
and Support Program (PBIS). We ask our parents to suppor
t their children at home by promoting 
the same positive behavior expectations: to respect and care for one another, be responsible for 
their actions and be safe at all times. PBIS VIP assemblies and classroom instruction that promote 
such behavior are part
 
of our daily instructional program.
 
 
Our school mission statement is: VRB Eagles will always strive for academic and personal excellence 
in a respectful, safe and culturally enriching environment involving parents, staff, and the 
community.
 
 
Our school cu
lture is inclusive of a school wide PBIS system and Restorative Justice practices that 
are aimed at helping each student reach their potential.  We promote school pride and PBIS school
-
wide activities. Students are acknowledged for their educational succes
ses and daily attendance on 
a monthly basis during Student of the Month Assemblies and Accelerated Reader Assemblies.
 
 
Please come and visit our school!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Sc
hool Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local
 
Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with da
ta reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about 
the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or
 
the 
district office.

glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study
