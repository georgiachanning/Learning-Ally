physical growth.The instructional program 
at Curtis Elementary is based on the Common Core Standards. Teachers collaborate frequently, 
analyzing data, planning lessons, and identifying effective teaching strategies. Student achievement 
is celebrated durin

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Curtis Elementary School, originally constructed in 1999, is currently comprised of 30 permanent classrooms, a cafeteria/mult
ipurpose room, a library, a 
staff lounge, a large play field
, and one playground. The school installed rubberized surfaces during the Summer of 2012. At the time of publication, 100%

pass at all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, dur
ing breaks, at lunch, and after school. Supervision is a 
responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators. To further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a 
comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been devel
oped by the School Site Council. The Safety Plan was most recently updated in March 2018; any 
revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following: 
 

 
School rules & procedures
 

 
Disaster procedu
res/routine & emergency drills
 

 
Current status of school crime
 

 
Notification to teachers
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures

Safe ingress & egress of pupils, parents/guardi
ans, & school employees

ke standards. Safety drills, 
including fire, earthquake, and code yellow are held monthly.

components and any needed
 
Facility Improvements. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, 
and floor systems.
