Our

work
 
diligently
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
is
 
responsive
 
to
 
the
 
differences
 
in

that
 
they

part
 
of
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
our

About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
for
 
Discovery
 
Elementary
 
School
 
was
 
developed
 
to
 
ensure
 
all
 
transitional
 
kindergarten
 
through
 
fifth
 
grade
 
students
 
are
 
safe
 
on
 
campus.
 
This
 
plan
 
is
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
our
 
population
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
resources
 
of
 
our
 
school
 
and
 
incorporates
 
three
 
essential
 
components
 
which
 
include:
 
(1)
 
providing
 
our
 
students
 
with
 
a
 
safe,
 
physical
 
environment,
 
(2)
 
creating
 
and
 
fostering
 
an
 
emotional
 
and
 
nurturing
 
environment,
 
and
 
(3)
 
providing
 
strategies
 
to
 
teach
 
every
 
student
 
the
 
essential
 
resiliency
 
skills.
 
The
 
plan
 
was
 
written
 
in
 
conjunction
 
with
 
the
 
school
 
site
 
council
 
and
 
was
 
approved
 
at
 
a
 
general
 
meeting
 
on
 
October
 
2019.
 
Local
 
law
 
enforcement
 
and
 
city
 
officials
 
were
 
consulted
 
during
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
plan
 
and
 
the
 
approval
 
process
 
to
 
assist
 
the
 
administration
 
in
 
designing
 
safety,
 
disaster,
 
behavior,
 
and
 
reporting
 
plans
 
for
 
a
 
site
 
serving
 
over
 
six
 
hundred
 
students.
 
Current
 
data
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
collected
 
regarding
 
transportation,
 
discipline,
 
and
 
student
 
safety
 
concerns
 
as
 
they
 
arise.
 
 
The
 
staff
 
members
 
monitor
 
school
 
grounds
 
30
 
minutes
 
before
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
school
 
and
 
immediately
 
after
 
dismissal.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
crossing
 
guard
 
on
 
duty
 
every
 
morning
 
and
 
afternoon
 
to
 
help
 
children
 
at
 
intersections
 
near
 
our
 
school.
 
We
 
require
 
parents
 
to
 
have
 
children
 
return
 
home
 
or
 
be
 
picked
 
up
 
immediately
 
after
 
school.
 
We
 
also
 
hold
 
monthly
 
drills
 
that
 
include
 
fire,
 
earthquake,
 
shelter
 
in
 
place,
 
secure
 
campus,
 
and
 
lockdown.
 
Peace
 
Patrol,
 
our
 
conflict

program,
 
trains
 
fourth
 
and
 
fifth-grade
 
students
 
to
 
act
 
as
 
peer
 
mediators
 
on
 
the
 
playground.
 
Our
 
teachers
 
hold
 
classroom
 
meetings
 
to
 
discuss
 
conflicts
 
between
 
students
 
as
 
needed.
 
In
 
more
 
serious
 
instances,
 
students
 
are
 
referred
 
to
 
an
 
administrator.
