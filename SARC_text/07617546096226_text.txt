(School

2019-20)
 
 
Parent
 
and
 
community
 
involvement
 
is
 
a
 
priority
 
for
 
our
 
school.
 
We
 
are
 
continually
 
working
 
on
 
providing
 
more
 
opportunities
 
for
 
parent
 
involvement.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
strong,
 
committed
 
group
 
of
 
parents
 
who
 
participate
 
in
 
our
 
monthly
 
coffee
 
with
 
the
 
principal
 
and
 
ELAC
 
meetings.
 
During
 
these
 
meetings,
 
parents
 
learn
 
about
 
our
 
site
 
goals,
 
academic
 
and
 
behavioral
 
programs
 
and
 
expectations.Throughout
 
the
 
year
 
we
 
hold
 
many
 
parent
 
and
 
family
 
nights
 
including:
 
math
 
night,
 
reading
 
night,
 
and
 
STEAM
 
nights.
 
We
 
also
 
hold

Open

where
 
parents
 
and

can

Parents
 
are
 
also
 
encouraged
 
to
 
be
 
members
 
of
 
our

Parents,

Each

emergency
 
drills
 
are
 
held
 
for
 
all
 
students
 
and
 
staff.
 
Each
 
trimester
 
we
 
perform
 
a
 
combination
 
earthquake,
 
fire,
 
intruder,
 
and
 
hazardous
 
spill
 
drills.
 
We
 
promote
 
an
 
environment
 
of
 
nonviolence
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
all
 
individuals.
 
Since
 
2009-10
 
we
 
have
 
implemented
 
Soul
 
Shoppe,
 
a
 
character
 
education
 
program
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
being
 
responsible,
 
safe
 
and
 
respectful.
 
This
 
program
 
improves
 
the
 
school
 
culture
 
via
 
character
 
building
 
and
 
conflict
 
resolution.
 
Rio
 
Vista
 
has
 
also
 
implemented
 
school-wide
 
positive
 
behavior
 
interventions.
 
Our

is
 
reviewed
 
and
 
updated
 
annually
 
in
 
February.
  
The
