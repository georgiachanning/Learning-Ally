By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Teachers set high academic goals, plan lessons that result in quality learning experiences, work continuously and 
collaboratively to improve instruction, and regularly evaluate student learning outcomes. Our emphasis is on standards
-

implementation, data analysis, intervention and differentiation strategies, technology, mathematics and reading 
strategies
. Staff is dedicated to working as a Professional Learning Community. Through this work, teachers at Betsy 
Ross collaborate as a Professional Learning Community to examine student work samples and assessment data, make 
instructional decisions, and exchange
 
ideas and strategies to improve student learning outcomes.
 
 
Additionally, the school participates in many supplementary educational activities such as environmental field trips, Arts 
Attack program, Readers Showcase, MakerSpace, Buildologie, Codologie Scra

Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 99.22% Overall rating: EXEMPLARY
 
 
General: The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort
, the 
District uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school 
and efforts made to e
nsure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are completed in a timely man
ner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to the site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergency repair needs exist at this s
ite.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. 
Cleaning schedules are developed jointly between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since 
Januar

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress 
[CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or
 
programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Most recent review date: 08/21/2019
 
 
Each 
year, Betsy Ross reviews and updates its comprehensive School Safety Plan and forwards a copy to the District's 
Risk Management Office who then submits the School Safety Plan to the Board of Education for approval. Before 
adopting our comprehensive School 
Safety Plan, the School Safety Committee holds a public meeting at the school site 
for input regarding the School Safety Plan. The Safety Plan covers two critical components:
 
1.
 
People and Programs/ School Climate
 
2.
 
Physical Environment
 
 
Staff, parents, an
d students at Betsy Ross work together to build a safe, secure and respectful environment for all 
students. The primary focus at Betsy Ross School is to provide a safe, secure, nurturing and respectful learning 
environment for all students.
 
 
Ross participa
tes in the PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support) Program. At 
the beginning of each school year teachers and their students tour all the stations around campus to make certain 
students are familiar with the expectations set by the Betsy Ross 
Code of Behavior. Throughout the school, as students 
model and practice the codes of behavior they receive Beep, Beep Bucks from Ross Staff (teachers, Special Ed IAs, NYS, 
librarian, custodians, bus drivers).
 
 
Students accumulate their Beep, Beep Bucks and
 
can either purchase items from 

 
The school safety plan is a public document and will be readily available for inspection at the school site and at the 
district o
ffice.
