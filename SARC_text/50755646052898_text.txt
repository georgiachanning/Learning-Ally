Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Fair 
Oaks students receive an academic curriculum aligned with the California Content Standards. We expect students to 
show annual growth in reading and math. Students with special needs receive assistance in order to meet individualized 
learning goals, and we 
develop and provide targeted interventions to struggling learners. Our diverse population requires 
speech and language services, Title I assistance (federal funds for low
-
income students), English Language Development 
(ELD) services, special education prog
rams, and psychological testing. Fair Oaks student and staff work diligently 
throughout the year building strong character traits focusing on "Being the Best Me." Fair Oaks is the largest elementary 
school in Oakdale, with over 860 K
-
6 students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Fair Oaks' school and grounds are very safe. Fair Oaks has a comprehensive Safe Schools Plan, which our staff updates and 
reviews annually. The staff also reviews safety procedures with students regularly and holds emergency fire, lockdown, 
and earthquake 
drills. This year, the district and site have implemented new procedures for active shooter emergencies, 
including a Lockdown/Barricade procedure and Run/Hide/Fight procedures. Staff emergency vests and radios have been 
provided by the site and district. G
ates were painted for easy identification in case the Run procedures were to be deemed 

badge while on campus. Staff members monitor 
the playground and campus before school, after school, and during recess. 
Our strict discipline policies curtail fighting and verbal or physical bullying. Our playground equipment is up to current 
safety standards and is inspected regularly. We routinely r

level groups to review 
student work, plan instruction, and discuss teaching strategies. The district provides an opportunity for grade

levels meet in PLCs to look at Common Formative Assessments, develop pacing 
calendars and discuss strategies to ensure student learning. In addition, the site provides staff with options to attend 
workshops or conferences on a variety of
 
topics ranging from classroom management (organization and disciplinary 
procedures) to specific teaching strategies. Classified instructional staff members also receive training on instructional 
norms. Ongoing support for the implementation of new content
 
is provided by district academic coaches, grade
-
level/department peers, and administrators.
