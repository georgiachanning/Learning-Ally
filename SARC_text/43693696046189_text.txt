By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cureton School has been providing a quality education to our community 
for over fifty years. Our teachers are dedicated 
to providing each and every student with the best educational opportunities possible. Our staff recognizes the importance 
of developing, in each student, an attitude of self
-
respect, self
-
worth, self
-
confide
nce, and a desire to be lifelong learners.
 
 
Consequently, the whole Cureton staff is committed to create an exciting and challenging learning environment for all of 
our students.
 
 
We are a Visual and Performing Arts focused school, with students participat
ing in choir, band, and art related instruction 
to enhance the core curricular areas. We have strengthened our two small learning communities at Cureton. Discovery 
small learning community is comprised of students in grades K
-
2, and Endeavor small learning
 
community is comprised of 
students in grades 3
-
5. The small learning communities allow us to personalize education and strengthen the meaningful 
relationships we seek to develop with all students.
 
 
Cureton has continued its partnership with City Year. Cit
y Year is comprised of 6
-
10 corps members who provide student 
support from 8:00am
-
6:00pm each school day, including daily tutoring and mentoring for intensive students, leading 
academic clubs during recess and lunch periods, and supervising after
-
school ac
tivities for 120 students. We are also 
partnering with Reading Partners to provide academic tutoring for intensive and strategic students.
 
 
In addition, Cureton has welcomed the Little Heroes program which continues to provide us with a coach who offers 
re
cess, lunchtime and physical education activities for all students, and a before school recess for all students who arrive 
early.
 
 
Our community partnerships have grown in intentional and meaningful ways. We now have the Family Resource Center/ 
First 5, wh
o shall be a vital resource for our families and community. We have renewed and strengthened relations with 
Audacity to support our VAPA theater strand and Silicon Valley Faces to provide Restorative Practices training to parents, 
staff and students.
 
 
Cure
ton staff strongly believes that parents are very important members of the school community. As a result, one of our 

can be, we need 
to work together to create a positive learning environment for all our students. Therefore, we encourage 
you to become active and informed. This may be done by attending meetings of the School Site Council or the English 
Learners Advisory Committee, joinin
g the Parent Teacher Association, volunteering to assist in the classroom, attending 

Maintaining this type of parent participation and communicati

happy to be developing a parent participation program and will be working with all families to assist them in completing 
30 hours of parent participation hours.
 
 
Thank you in advance for your s
upport. We welcome your suggestions, and we will solicit your help throughout the school 
year. If you need additional information or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us at (408)928

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
The district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district
 
uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The re
sults of this 
survey are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
Cureton School was built in 1955. School facilities are being renovated according to the Field Act requirements of the State 
Building Code with a focus on earthquake safet
y. In the event that asbestos and lead containing building materials are 
found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, and local requirements. Deferred 
maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate 
district buildings. Needed repairs and maintenance 
projects are completed in a timely manner.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Asse
ssment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] 
and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standar
ds [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University,
 
or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cureton Elementary School has a very detailed, comprehensive school safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and 
procedures in the event of any/all 
emergencies. This plan was revised in 2017. The plan also contains the yearly safety 
goals as determined by the students, staff, and parents. The Safety Plan is developed by the Cureton Safety Committee 
before it is presented to the Alum Rock Union Element
ary School District Board of Trustees for approval. The plan was last 
approved by the school board in February 2013. The Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the year with 
all staff. Safety alerts are shared with all staff as needed through
out the school year. In addition, all required drills are 
calendared and completed, and the results are shared with the staff. The Cureton Safety Plan has a comprehensive, 
enforceable, and continuous behavior policy, set of rules and regulations, dress cod
e policy, set of protocols for 
safety/emergency drills, tardy policy, attendance policy, referral policy, Internet policy, and a nondiscriminatory policy on
 
student rights and responsibilities. The Safety Plan is revised annually.
 
 
Horace Cureton Elementar
y School is a closed campus during the hours of 8:00am
-
6:00 pm. Any persons wishing to enter 
the facility must obtain clearance in our office before entering campus. This includes outside organizations and all visitors
. 
Once checked into the office, which 
consists of noting the date and time of visit, as well as the reason for the visit, all 
visitors are provided with a visitor badge. Visitors must also log their time of departure upon leaving the school. All 
classroom observations must also be pre
-
arranged
 
24 hours in advanced.
 
 
Campus safety is supported by exterior gates which remain closed and locked during the time of instruction. All entrants 
must pass through the office through our large double gates which remain open during the school day. Lighting i
s provided 
in all hallways and in the front of school beginning at 6:00pm each evening until 7:00am each morning. Furthermore, the 
grounds are monitored by the morning custodian beginning at 6:00am and concluding at 9:00pm with the evening 
custodian. Durin
g school hours, the administrators and teachers serve to provide safety support during the 10 minutes 
prior to the start of instruction, 10 minutes following the instructional day, and during all organized breaks (recess, lunch
, 
and organized community eve
nts).
 
 
Our safety committee convenes to review and update the safety plan, identify new areas of concern, and calendar fire, 
earthquake, and disaster drills.
 
 
A comprehensive approach to creating safe and effective schools must include four components that
 
interact and affect 
the safety of the whole campus. The four components are: the personal characteristics (students, school, community and

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Cureton receives two categories of funding each year. Our general fund essentially covers the cost of our teachers and 
staff salaries. The majority
 
of our school funding is defined as categorical funding. Categorical funding is money that can 
be spent on very specific demographics of students, such as English learners. Categorical funding requires justification 
prior to spending, including careful re
view by our School Site Council and leadership team. This funding is utilized to 
provide the support mechanisms our students need to succeed such as:
 

 
Supplementary materials are available, such as: leveled readers, Big Books, Books on Tape, poetry charts, 
Scholastic News, Spelling books (grades 1
-
5), phonics books (grades 1 and 2), dictionaries, thesauruses, class 
sets of trade books, classroom library books, educational software.
