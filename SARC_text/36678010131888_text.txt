By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Chemehuevi Valley Elementary School opened its doors 
on August 31, 1981.  For 28 years, from 1981 through 2009, the 
school served the Chemehuevi community, which includes the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe and Havasu Landing, and housed 
students from Kindergarten through the eighth grade, kindergarten through fifth
, and kindergarten through sixth, seventh, 
and eighth grade again.  Often during that time, Chemehuevi Valley Elementary often maintained the highest attendance 
rate in the district, a testament to the connection between the school and the community.
 
 
In Ju
ne of 2009, Chemehuevi Valley Elementary was closed due to declining enrollment and district budgetary constraints.  
Agreements were made between neighboring districts, counties, and states which allowed students once served by 
Chemehuevi Valley Elementary
 
to attend school in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  Many students attended school in the Lake 
Havasu Unified School District, in Lake Havasu City, AZ, while others remained in the Needles Unified School District.  Those
 
students continuing to attend school in the 
Needles Unified School District were bussed to Needles.
 
 
Chemehuevi Valley Elementary School remained closed until the summer of 2015.  With the revised budget formulas 
implemented by the State of California, the leadership of Superintendent Dr. Mary McNeil
, and the support of the 
Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, the school reopened for the 2015
-
2016 school year in August, 2015.
 
 
Currently Chemehuevi Valley Elementary School has an enrollment of 39 students and serves grades Transitional 
Kindergarten through grade fi
ve.  Of the 39 students enrolled, 67% are Native American, 23% are Hispanic/Native 
American, 5% are White, and 5% are Black. There are three classrooms: TK
-
2,   3
-
5 and a resource classroom.  The 
Chemehuevi Valley Elementary School staff consists of three 
teachers, two paraprofessionals (one of which also serves as 
the school secretary), a cafeteria cook, a custodian, and principal.  All three teachers are highly qualified and experienced
.  
Both paraprofessionals are highly qualified and assist in the class
rooms.  San Bernardino County Schools provide speech 
and counseling services for students requiring those services.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
October, 2019
 
 
The Needles Unified School District held a public hearing on October 22, 2019, and determined that each school within 
the District had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and sc
ience lab equipment, pursuant to the 
settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.  In addition, the District ensured sufficiency of visual and performing a
rts 
materials for the 2019
-
2020 school year.  All students, including English learners, have a
ccess to their own textbooks and 
instructional materials to use in class and at home.  Supplemental materials that support students with special needs are 
also provided using categorical funds, lottery funds, and grants.  When State textbook funds do not m
eet our needs, 
general fund dollars are allocated by our governing board to ensure our textbook needs are met.
 
 
The adoption of Mathematics Common Core State Standards in 2010, revisions in 2013, and the move to CAASPP 
Assessments in 2013, created a void i
n the availability of California SBE adopted textbooks that addressed the new 
standards and assessments.  This led to some districts, including Needles Unified, to identify and adopt curriculum which 
will better meet the needs of students and improve the l
ikelihood of success in the classroom and on state assessments.  
The most recent CA SBE Math adoption in 2014, included new instructional materials, but none fit the needs of the district.  
enVision Math 2.0, by Pearson, was evaluated prior to the start of
 
the 2016
-
17 school year and found by the NUSD to be 
consistent with the California State Standards.  On June 28, 2016, Pearson, enVistion Math 2.0 was adopted by the Needles 
Unified School District Board of Trustees for grades TK
-
5.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
August 28, 2019.  At Chemehuevi Valley Elemen
tary School, there are 4 classrooms, one portable classroom serving as a 
speech lab, a common room, cafeteria, and an office. There is one playground.  All facilities were upgraded, painted, and 
had new flooring installed prior to reopening the school in 2
015.  Student fire drills and drop and cover drills are conducted 
monthly.  Irrigation and trees were planted in the playground in the Spring of 2017.  Funds for trees and irrigation was 
provided through a grant from PG&E.  Installation of the irrigation a
nd planting of the trees was completed by the 
Chemehuevi Indian Tribe EPA Department.  Additional playground improvements including a school garden are planned 
with the assistance of the Chemehuevi EPA Department.

Number of school days 
dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional Development is an integral aspect of the District's plan for the ongoing growth of all District employees. The 
purpose of professional development is to create schools in 
which all students and staff members are learners who 
continually improve their performance.
 
 
In addition, school sites have ongoing staff development at their respective schools. Chemehuevi Valley Elementary School 
has weekly Early Release Days on Wednesd
ays with instructional time still exceeding or meeting the State requirements. 
The focus during early release days is professional development on grade level State Standards and effective instructional 
strategies as well as teacher collaboration with their
 
colleagues and administration to develop best practices. 
Administration, staff and consultants work together to provide these professional development sessions.
 
 
Principals are engaged in the study of research
-
based practices which increase student learni
ng. Professional development 
is a part of every principals meeting.
 
 
We successfully support beginning teachers in their first and second year of teaching with research
-
based coaching 
programs.  Each beginning teacher receives expert help from an experienc
ed Support Provider.
