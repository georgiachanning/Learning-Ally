By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our goal at Morrill Middle School is to foster a safe, clean, posit
ive and respectful learning environment for all students 
and staff; provide a school learning environment where students can develop into positive and productive citizens well 
prepared for their future. 
 
 
Morrill Middle School's mission is to prepare all s
tudents to be lifelong learners contributing to a globally
-
connected 
community. 
 
 

 

 
21st century student
-
centered learning
 

 
Inclusivity through equitable access for all s
tudents and staff
 

 
Engagement beyond the classroom to expand the student and staff experience and their contributions
 

 
The opportunity to develop into positive and productive citizens
 
The mission and vision are accomplished by providing our students with a safe and positive environment that supports 
their learning. Through high expectations for behavior and academics, we will guide students as they acquire the 
knowledge, skills, and att
itudes that foster an enjoyment of learning, a respect for themselves and others, and the ability 
to become responsible citizens. Morrill Middle School is a great place for children to grow and develop as they move from 
sixth through eighth grade. The staf
f at Morrill is caring, and continually challenges the students to be at their best each 
and every day. We are continuously improving to meet the needs of our learners as well as the needs of society. 
 
 
Important to our school's success is an effective par
tnership between parents, the community, and the school. Our school 
has worked with the community to create a Parent
-
Teacher
-
Student Association to increase avenues for community 
engagement in our school and in providing for our students. Our students are 
very important to us, and all of the Morrill 
Middle School community will do whatever we can to help our students to be successful this year, and throughout their 
lives. 
 
 
Berryessa Union School District provides all students the skills to become lifelong 
learners and successful 21st century 
global citizens. At Morrill, we help achieve the district mission by offering rigorous, standards aligned curriculum for our 
students. Providing teacher training and support to ensure they can provide the highest qualit
y instruction for all students 
is a priority of our school. By engaging students within the classroom, as well as outside of the classroom, we believe we 
can impact the whole student in achieving success. Through after school sports, clubs, and homework su
pport, our 
students are able to access resources for support and inclusion both inside and outside of the classroom.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
:  The district places a strong emphasis on 
ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State 
of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations.  The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of the school facil
ities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings.  Below is more specific information on the condition of the school an
d the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings
: Morrill was opened in 1972. This school has 46 regular classrooms, as well as an art, instrumental 
music, choral musi
c, multipurpose, flexible instructional space, a library, and an administration building. In addition to the 
main classrooms, there are two portable classrooms added to provide addition classroom space.
 
 
In a joint venture with the City of San Jose, the dis
trict constructed a 22,000 sq. ft. Berryessa Youth Center (BYC) in 2005. 
The building has a large gymnasium for school use, and also serves as an after
-
hours youth center for the city of San Jose 
Department of Recreation, YMCA, and the community.
 
 
Maintena
nce and Repair
:  District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 
highest priority is giv

in good working order.

Cleaning Process and Schedule
:  The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summar
y of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that
 
classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.
 
 
Modernization Projects
:  During the 2018 summer period, local bond funds (Measure L) were used to complete various 
modernization projects.  These projects included insta
llation of new flooring, replacement of classroom furniture, painting 
of identified interior spaces throughout the campus and the construction of a Flexible Instructional Space.  All work 
described was completed by the end of the 2018/19 school year.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As a result of our 
involvement with a city safety initiative, the city of San Jose provides resources that help us improve 
campus safety and are on call when needed. Members of our staff supervise our campus 10 minutes before the start of 
school and immediately after dismiss
al. Staff also supervise students during break and lunch. Our staff members hold 
monthly drills which include; fire, earthquake, intruder alert, and evacuation drills. We also require all visitors to regist
er 
with the office.
 
 
Our school safety plan was bu
ilt with input from the district safety committee, the School Site Council, staff, and the 
administrative team. We set 4 goals for the school for the 2019
-
2020 school year, 2 social and 2 physical safety goals. Our 
social goals focus on reduced suspensions
 
and the implementation of restorative justice practices and procedures to build 
our community. Our physical goals are the creating of appropriate fencing to have a secure campus and walkie talkies for 
each wing of the school to increase communication in t
he event of an emergency.

Individual school sites 
offer Supplemental Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to each individual 
school sit e to identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certific
ated and classified staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each school also identifies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer
-
 
based 
programs where students can work independen
tly at their current academic level. Some schools provide this time to 
receive help on their homework.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 school year.  The district office working with our 
site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as well as staff feedback when developing the scope a
nd 
sequence.

At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers received training on providing effective Tier 1 
inst
ruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instructional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , 
and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recently adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers 
participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

certificated colleagues in order to have th
e opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of t
he new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-

comprehensive sexuality prog
ram.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.
 
 
Throughout the school year, we offered monthly profession
al development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year in alignment with the District focus on developing
 
a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teac
hers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
pr
ovided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four instructional coaches provided BTSA induction trainin
g for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to an instructional coach so that they can receive fol
low up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
by WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Educa
tion.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the district goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of s
upport at each site.
