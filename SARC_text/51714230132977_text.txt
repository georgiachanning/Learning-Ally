By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Sutter Peak Charter Academy (SPCA) opened in the fall of 2015
 
as an independent charter school. SPCA was founded by 
the Pacific Charter Institute, a 501 (c) 3 tax exempt non

relationship of the teacher, the student, and the parent. The dynamics surrounding this vital geometry assists in ensuring 
that the student and parent both realize the sc
ope of the overarching goals for all students at the school. The teacher 
develops personal learning tools to successfully complete the curriculum. The Academic Triangle is the symbol for what is 
expected for each student in that it empowers each agent of t
he triangle to take charge of the educational plan, regardless 
of the stability of all of the legs.
 
 
Both the mission statement and vision present clear expectations that students become active participants in their own 
education and their future. The stre
ngth of the Academic Triangle lies in its essential ability to support students who may 
not have sufficient academic stamina or self

Academic 
Standards are central to school

wide learner outcomes. SPCA implements and uses appropriate California State 
Standards based curriculum along with standards based supplemental supports for all students. We also utilize a variety 
of online support programs 
that are aligned to Common Core Standards and are California specific.
 
 
Additionally, SPCA addresses its school
-
wide learner outcomes and academic standards through the implementation of 
the Academic Triangle model which ensure the fidelity of our mission 
and vision. This includes students that are socio
-
economically disadvantaged, English learners, foster/homeless youth, credit deficient, or academically challenged. We are 
committed to producing self
-
 
motivated students who develop an appreciation for life
long learning.

Career Technical Education Programs (School Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
 
SPCA prepares students for college and career paths by using standards based 
curriculum, interest assessments (Career 
Cruising) to identify engaging courses, and develop personalized learning plans for high school students. Sutter Peak's CTE 
(Career Technical Education) online certificate program (icevonline.org) is embedded into e
lective coursework to guide 
post
-
graduation plans for navigating college and CTE pathways. Students earn industry certifications which are developed 
by industry leaders, reflect the needs of real
-
world career expectations and distinguish students from thei
r peers when 
applying for jobs.  Certifications reflect real
-
world scenarios, preparing students for not only post
-
secondary education 
but also the workforce.  One hundred percent of our high school graduates will have either taken a minimum of two 
college
 
level courses (typically at a local community college) and/or will have completed an industry sponsored certificate 
by using our online CTE curriculum.  Courses are easily accessed online and teachers, school counselors and PCI/district 
monitors their pro
gress.   Students can choose from 15 CTE courses:
 

 
Fundamentals of Animal Science
 

 
Equine Management & Evaluation

The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Sutter Peak Charter Academy  uses a range of methods to consult with and receive parental input. This includes but is not 
limited to parent, student, and teacher Academic Triangle collaboration, email and phone communication, parent and 
student 
surveys, parent participation in school activities, and parent contributions to school protocols development.
 
 
The Academic Triangle is a powerful and unique feature to Sutter Peak in which the three major stakeholders; the teacher, 
the student, and the pa
rent work together to develop solid academic plans for the student based on various criteria. The 

affiliations and relationships, and curre
nt status. Based on these criteria, the Academic Triangle is best able to determine 
the intensity of the educational experience and the right combination of opportunities.
 
 
Parents and students are surveyed at least annually to determine their satisfaction
 
with Sutter Peak Charter Academy. 
This reflective survey will help the school make program modifications to better serve the students. The faculty, 
administration, and the board will review the results of the surveys.
 
 
Parents are physically involved in s
chool activities through a variety of events. Every parent is invited to participate in our 
parent meetings, scheduled before school wide participation events.  This group of parents, teachers and director, 
provides input for school spending, activities an
d academics. Parents attend all fieldtrips with their children including, this 
year, students completed a two day outdoor science camp.  Other fieldtrips include, but not limited to: Local plays and 
performances, local museums, and train excursions.  Paren
ts are also invited to attend co
-
operatives that provide 
enrichment for students through classes such as art, math and language enrichment.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
Professional Development at Sutter Peak Charter Academy provides both breadth and depth on current topics in 
education. During the year we focus 
extensively on teaching strategies, online academic programs. These topics are 
chosen from the student learning plans as identified by the student's master course list, benchmark and cumulative 
testing.
 
 
We are continuing to embrace the Common Core State Standards and implementing them in core,supplemental 
curriculum, and interventions. Our commitment is to make professional development relevant and timely so that our 
students benefit from what the teacher
s learn. 
 

 
Sutter Peak conducts 2 days of in
-
service training at the beginning of each school year. However, an ongoing 
professional development plan is in place for our staff based on a three
-
tiered model. District Wide, Site
-
Wide 
and Individual growth mod
el. This allows our instructional staff to achieve competency in multiple paths. With 
the use of our LCAP monies in addition to our general fund, the following focuses were developed with input 
from all staff members via a district
-
wide survey: Common Core
 
Professional Development which included the 
following: Beginning Teacher Induction as well as the opportunity for teachers to access all County Office of 
Education Professional Development Opportunities. Additional Online Learning Programs and Supports as
 
a 
result of use of a hybrid model of online learning platforms for student and teacher use. Using Data to Support 
Learning and Instruction Using Technology to Support Learning
 
 
In the most recent year, one or more teachers participated in online math trai
ning and or a multi day reading strategies
