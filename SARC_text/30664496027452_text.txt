By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
At Laurel Elementary, we believe that all students should
 
feel comfortable and safe on school grounds before, during and 
after school. It is critical that we provide a safe learning environment for all on campus. During school hours, students are
 
supervised by school faculty and staff. The school facility includ
es sufficient classroom space to meet the needs of an 
enrollment of our approximately 481 students, including pre
-
school.

The playground sufficiently provides play areas for students with the assistance of flexible scheduling to facilitate efficie
nt 
usa
ge of the playground. To ensure optimal learning opportunities, faculty and staff coordinate classroom facility usage 
to include intervention instruction. BOUSD takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To
 
assist in th
is effort, all district sites use the Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT), which was developed by the State of California 
Office of Public School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the BOUSD district 
office. Belo
w is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe and functional learning environment.
 
 
Laurel Elementary School houses 26 classrooms, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, l
ibrary/media lab, an office with supply 
room, health office, and psychologist office. The main campus was built in 1922 and additions were constructed in the 
1950s. Portable classrooms and the library/media lab were added in the 1990s.
 
 
Safety concerns are
 
the number one 
priority of Maintenance and Operations Department. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and conduct 
inspections at school sites on a regular basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
complete
d in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. As of January 2019, none of the eight emergency conditions cited in Education Code 17592.72 
exist at this school. The 
current Facilities Inspection Tool was completed in January 2019. The district governing board has 
adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office.
 
The Principal works with the cu
stodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A safe school environment is our first priority
 
at Laurel Elementary School. All parents and visitors are welcomed and 

 
Additionally, visitors are required to 
return to the school office upon departure. During lunch, 
recesses, and before and after school, assigned staff members 
supervise students and school grounds, including the cafeteria and playgrounds to ensure a safe and orderly environment. 
 
 
 
Annually, the School Site Council evaluates and updates the Laurel Ele
mentary School Safety Plan. In an effort to stay 
current and ensure all new staff are thoroughly trained, safety procedures are reviewed with school and District staff in 
the fall each year. The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by BOUSD to comp
ly with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) 
of 1997. Development of the School Safety Plan is a joint effort of school staff, site administration, and the School Site 
Council. The District Resource Police Officer signs the plan annually. The Laurel Elementary School 
Safety Plan was adopted 
and signed by the School Site Council at the regularly scheduled meeting in the fall. 
  
 
 
 
The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirem
ents of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; p
rovision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and 
school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures. Annually, the school evaluates 
and updates the plan.
 
 
 
Laurel's action plan has fi
ve primary goals for the school year.
 
 
1.
 
Establish a calendar of monthly drills. Drills to be organized, calm, and quick to allow for routine and muscle 
memory in the event of a real emergency.
 
2.
 
Meet with
 
Classified Staff twice a year to discuss safety plan.
 
3.
 
All staff will participate in SPOT to Reduce the number of major discipline incidents.
 
4.
 
Review and restock emergency supplies as necessary.
 
5.
 
Ensure that sub plans reflect students with severe medical nee
ds.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

Laurel Elementary Magnet School of Innovation and Career Exploration offers some programs to support students after 
school. Through collaboration with the Brea Olinda Unified School 
District's Child Development Department, we offer a 
90 minute after school homework help and enrichment opportunity for select students who have no other support or 
activities after school. Most students receive either free or reduced lunch or have been id
entified by teachers as in need 
of support or were recommended by parent request. The school uses Title 1 funds to pay for an after school aide who also 
works inside the classrooms to support student needs on homework and content specific work.
 
 
As an addi
tional alternative support designed to increase the academic achievement of students, Laurel has utilized Title 
1 funds to hire a fully credentialed intervention teacher to support students at risk and in need of support and growth in 
the area of Reading/L
anguage Arts during the school day.
