By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Hickman School District joined the Charter world in 1994 when i
t sponsored a start
-
up school, Hickman Charter School.  
After witnessing the success of the Hickman Charter School students, along with the positive power of the parent/staff 

-
5) and Middle School (6
-
8) chose
 
to embrace the possibilities charter status 
could afford. Charter status empowered us to better meet the challenge of supporting the diverse needs of all students. 
Thus, in 2000 both schools converted to charter status.  Since there are just 3 schools in 
the district, once all were charter, 
we became the Hickman Community Charter District.  The district's charter has been renewed in 2005, 2010, and 2015.  
In 2019 Hickman Elementary School was recognized as a California Distinguished School.
 
 
There is power
 
in being a district of choice. With this power, we choose the mindset of creative flexibility, which includes 
not only flexible scheduling, but also creative staffing with all three schools working interactively. We choose to create a 
culture where a coll


 
 
Our Mission: Inspiring students to learn and grow to their potential.
 
 
Our Vision: Every student a responsible, productive 
citizen in a diverse and competitive world.
 
 
Our Values and Beliefs:
 
 
Success of All Students: All students can learn and they learn in different ways. They deserve the opportunity to have 
instruction delivered in a way that is meaningful, relevant, and ac
cessible to them.  The process of learning is as important 
as the product and requires a growth mindset.
 
 
High Expectations: Expectations for students, parents, and staff are clearly defined, understood, and shared. Students, 
parents, and staff are empower
ed, supported, and trained to meet those expectations.
 
 
Respect and Integrity:  Every person is valuable and deserves respect. Communication and interaction is defined by mutual 
respect, trust, and support.
 
 
Teamwork:  The organization works 
collaboratively and creatively to ensure student success in a supportive environment. 
Successes are recognized and celebrated. Parental involvement is an essential element of a quality educational 
experience.
 
 
Safety: Schools and work sites are safe and se
cure for students, parents, and staff.
 
 
Effectiveness and Efficiency: Financial and human resources are managed effectively, and prioritized to meet the goals 
and expectations of the organization.
 
 
Continuous Improvement: Staff, parents, and students colla
boratively evaluate progress using multiple, reliable measures, 
and make changes when needed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAAS
PP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through ei
ght and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant
 
cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or prog
rams 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

The Hickman Community Charter District has a School Safety Plan which covers many components of school safety to 
include both the 
physical and social environments. The School Safety Plan was developed using the most current law 
enforcement advice.  Local emergency services has reviewed and has a copy of the current plan.
 
 
Copies of the School Safety Plan are located in the district a
nd school offices and are available to the public upon request. 
The plan is a continual work
-
in
-
progress and is reviewed by staff and stakeholders whenever updates or changes are made. 
The Stanislaus County Emergency Services Agency reviewed our plan in No
vember of 2018 and made suggestions to 
improve safety procedures and protocol.    The current plan was last revised in February 2019.   Faculty and staff are 
informed of the changes in the School Safety Plan on the first staff workday of each school year a
nd when changes are 
made to the plan mid
-
year. Planned drills, including Evacuation Drills, Earthquake Drills, Critical Incident Drills are practiced 
each month of the school year.  The District trained on response to active shooters and other critical inc
idents in August 
of 2019.

The primary focus of professional development in 2019
-
20 is improving instruction for EL students.  The goal is to have 
60% of the students to move up at least one band on the summative ELPAC.  In 
addition, all teachers create professional 
goals for continuous improvement.  HES admin monitors these and provides feedback.
 
 
HES teachers received 2 full days per year of Professional Development.  In addition, HES teachers can use a ½ day sub 
each month
 
to plan and collaborate with partner teacher.  Professional development focus was chosen by review of the 
assessment data and staff input. Professional development has been delivered through a combination of methods 
including a summer fellowships, monthly
 
inservice workshops, and conference attendance.  Teachers are supported 
during implementation through grade level and subject matter collaboration teams that include administrators.  
Administrator provides reflective feedback during walkthroughs.
