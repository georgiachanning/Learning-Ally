By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Hacienda Elementary School opened its doors to students August 2007.  The building of the school had been approved by 
the citizens of California City five years earlier when a bond was passed fundin
g the building of a new elementary and high 
school.  The Hacienda Elementary student body was formed by joining together students from two other schools.  The 
fourth and fifth grade students from Robert P. Ulrich Elementary School and the sixth grade stude
nts from California City 
Middle School were removed from their respective school sites to form the student body of Hacienda Elementary School.  
Along with the students, the fourth and fifth grade teachers from Robert P. Ulrich and the sixth grade teachers 
from 
California City Middle School were also joined to become the teaching staff of Hacienda Elementary School. In the 2015
-
16 school year the district realigned the California City schools due to CCSS and enrollment. Hacienda began serving 
students 3
-
5 an
d the 6th graders were moved to California City Middle School.
 
 
The current enrollment at Hacienda Elementary is around 537 students. The site consists of 7
-
third grade classrooms,  5
-
 
fourth grade classrooms, 5
-
 
fifth grade classrooms, a 4/5 combination a
nd a 4/5 Gifted and Talented classroom, 1 
Intervention classrooms, and two Special Day Classes.  In addition Hacienda has a resource specialist.
 
 
School Mission
 
 
The mission of Hacienda Elementary School is to provide students with the highest quality of e
ducation so they may obtain 
academic excellence in preparation for high school graduation as well as post high school opportunities. We strive to 
create an individual that possesses the skills to become successful in their future endeavors by being awesome
 
J.E.T.S : 
Joining together to Encourage taking responsibility and Showing respect and safe actions.
 
 
"We will work together with families and the community to encourage students to realize their potential and give them 
the skills needed to be successful b
eyond their years at Hacienda. We will create individuals who show respect for 
themselves and others, and who take responsibility for their learning and the decisions they make; and resolve differences 

s motivations while ensuring fairness."
 
 
It is our vision to  "provide an environment where students are motivated to reach both their academic and personal goals 
while engaging in rigorous and creative lessons. Acceptance of others and mutual 
respect will be displayed at all times. As 
a staff we will model good character and strive to positively impact the lives of our students. We are dedicated to the 
belief that all students can and will learn."
 
To meet the goals set forth by the school, numerous supports have been put into place for the students and staff of 
Hacienda Elementary School.  All students have been provided with curriculum that is aligned with the California Common 
Core State Standards
.  The curriculum used is consistent grade level to grade level so that students are provided with 
information that is presented in a comprehensive, systematic manner.  The majority of teachers at the school site have 
had intensive training in the use of t
he common core and EDI.  Students in grades 3
-
5 are provided with 2 hours daily of 
English/language arts instruction and 1 hour daily of mathematic instruction.  In addition students receive a minimum of 
30 minutes of Response to Intervention (RTI) time in
 
English/language arts and 30 minutes of RTI time in mathematics 
four times per week.  Response to Intervention is used to re
-
teach students who are struggling in specific skill areas, 
provide additional practice to those who need it, and enrich students w
ith higher level learning needs.  Identified English 
language learners received an additional 30 minutes of EL support using the State approved Treasures series. Students 
who qualify for intensive intervention in reading are assigned to the Read 180/System
 
44 classrooms.

Students who have been identified as Gifted and Talented are offered GATE placement in fourth grade.  This placement 
consists of a self
-
contained, 4/5 combination class.  The GATE teacher uses the California Common Core Standards to 
guide h
er instruction while providing the GATE students with the curriculum and instruction strategies to meet their 
unique learning needs. These students are challenged in a unique learning environment with project based learning.
 
Respect, responsibility, and co

All students are expected to be responsible for themselves and their school site.  Students are given planners in which 
they can plan out their weeks and track their
 
assignments.  Community service is stressed to students so that they realize 
they have a responsibility to others which stretches beyond the school site.  The Peer Helper Program has been developed 
for students who exemplify what being a JET is all about.
 
In order to raise awareness and stress the importance of being 
kind to others an annual "Walk of Kindness" was added to the Hacienda events calendar.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

also on the newly adopted  ELA and Mathematics curriculum. All of these workshops were 
provided made available within the district. Teachers at the site were also given training in Time to Teach. This program 
provides school wide best practices and proced
ures. Time to Teach provides students with behavior reflection and 
restorative practices. Surveys are taken each year by the district to determine areas of interest for staff development.

pate in conferences that would be beneficial to the 
entire site. Those who participated shared their knowledge and experience at PLC's throughout the year.
