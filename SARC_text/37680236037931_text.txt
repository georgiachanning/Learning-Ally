leaders of tomorrow on the pillars of academic rigor, personal integrity, and civic responsibility. 
Our mission is to support these future 
leaders to love to learn and to respect others through a 
commitment between students, parents and staff. We value the uniqueness of each child and their 
individual learning styles. Learning is meaningful and relevant and touches all aspects of the child's 
life. Our diversity is embraced and enhanced across the curriculum and is linked with the world 
outside of the classroom. All members of the Rice community recognize and promote the joy and 
importance of learning as a lifelong process. The community suppor
ts an environment which 
facilitates students who are respectful of themselves and others, innovative problem solvers, self
-
motivated and confident in their ability to achieve, responsible for themselves and others, and 
multilingual and multi

literate. Rice
 
School derives strength from an active participation of 
community including alumni, parents, business, staff, and nearby Chula Vista High School. Everyone 
is encouraged and taught to be responsible for the success of our students. A variety of seminars 
ar
e offered to parents/care givers to become more effective. The Rice School community is 
committed to creating a safe, clean physical environment that is aesthetically inviting and 
supportive of learning for all students. We plan to create a dynamic learnin

supports and encourages excellent teaching and educational growth to our staff, students, and 
their families. The Rice School Community is dedicated to nurturing our students as our most 
precious resource and our future leaders.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
la
w to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required t
o prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
c
onsistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more infor
mation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the 
school principal or the 
district office.
