Description
 
Welcome to New River Elementary School! In 2019
-
2019 our staff, students, and parents continue 
to create a climate and curriculum that ensures academic rigor and consistency across the grade 
levels. New River Elementary is on the forefront of u
sing technology as a learning tool. Our 
modernized computer labs are used by Kinder through fifth grades to learn technology skills and 
strengthen learning. Students have access to web
-
based programs to help them master Common 
Core State Standards in langu
age arts and math. Teachers use computers to create lessons and 
presentations, and students use computers during the instructional day in small groups. Classrooms 
use document cameras and LCD projectors to facilitate learning. In addition, we have iPads th
at 
students use for instructional purposes and for taking the SBAC.
 
 
 
 
In addition to our core instruction, New River offers a "second dose" of reading instruction. In first 
and second grades, students are challenged to reach their fullest potential as rea
ders  in our Knights 
Achieving Reading Excellence (KARE) program. In third, fourth, and fifth grades extra support is 
offered to students who need additional work on reading skills through our Leveled Literacy 
Intervention (LLI) program. Our Intervention T
OSA coordinates these programs. Our school also 
offers after school support to our second through fifth grade students in our Knight's Academy 
Program. In addition to teaching academics, New River also believes that character education is 
critical to helpi
ng a child develop positive behavioral skills for life. We teach the traits of 
trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, and caring through the Character Counts 
curriculum. Our Elementary Student Support Specialist assists with our character educ
ation.  We 
also have a music program that teaches students in Kinder through fifth grades about the 
fundamentals of music. Our hope is to engage students more deeply in all areas and spark their 

m. We always welcome parents and 
volunteers.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides r
eports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publ
icly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a w
orkstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We have many ways for parents to participate in school activities, and we depend on parents to provide input on how our progr
ams can best support 
our students. Parents can join our School Site Council, which works with staff a
nd administration to help make financial decisions that affect student 
achievement. Parents of English learners are vital to our ELAC committee and to our outreach efforts for new families. Parent
 
workshops are held 
throughout the year on a variety of topi
cs, including academics and other areas as requested by parents. Parent volunteers help with special projects in 

nd fund
-
raisers th
at are held 
throughout the year. In addition, we ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences 
twice yearly. We are always in need of more volunteers! For information about participatin
g at our school, please contact our Parent Liaison in the school 
office at (562) 210

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety is a priority at all times at New River. Supervision Aides monitor the school grounds for thirty minutes before school
 
and twenty minutes after 
school, as well as, at all recess and lunch
times. Teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground. Through 
Playworks, our Recess Coach provides structured play activities that promote pro
-
social behavior and that get our students physically active.
 
Students 
are provided ample play equipment, and we reward them for respectful behavior with Knightly Notes and other positive incentiv
es. Visitors must enter 
the school through the main gate and sign in at the office, where they receive a visitor's badge 
to wear throughout their stay.

We revise our Safe School Plan annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emerge
ncy supplies. We keep a 
copy in the office for parents to view. We share the plan with all staff du
ring a school
-
wide staff meeting. We practice fire, earthquake and lock
-
down 
drills on a regular basis and hold training for staff on an as
-
needed basis. We also participate in the annual California Shakeout emergency drill.

This year the teaching staff at New River continue to focus their staff development to further their understanding of the Cal
ifornia Common Core State 
Standards in the content areas of Language Arts, Math, and English Language Development (for students who
 
are second language learners).
 
 
Teachers work in collaborative grade
-
level teams to dive deeper into the content standards two times per month. Administration and Common Core 
Teachers lead the majority of staff meetings. Teacher release time is offered to
 
all grade level teams to develop expertise in their subjects.
 
 
In addition to the site professional development, the district offers training for teachers from grades Kinder through fifth 
grades in the areas of Language 
Arts, Math, and Writing. The traini
ng is on
-
going through out the school year.
