School Description
 
In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to 
issue an Annual School 
Accountability Report Card. The main objective is to inform the community about conditions and progress 
being made at Kennedy STEM Academy.
 
 
In 2012, Kennedy received the CA Distinguished Schools Award for our efforts and programs to
 
improve 
student achievement and increase physical fitness and healthy eating. In 2016, Kennedy received the CA Gold 
Ribbon School Award for our STEM program and the Title I Academic Achievement Award.
 
 
Kennedy STEM Academy has a population of approximatel
y 470 students representing many different ethnic 
backgrounds, cultures, and at least 17 different languages.  Our school  has three special day classes for 
students identified as having special needs.  Our school hosts a Head Start Program and Extended Da
y Care 
Program. This cosmopolitan character of our school creates an atmosphere of respect and appreciation for 
the diversity of the human experience.
 
 
Kennedy STEM Academy is a school community where the highest expectations are maintained.  Kennedy 
utili
zes available resources to enable students to become life
-
long learners who possess the ability to achieve 
their potential. We promote a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment that invites students to actively 
participate in educational opportunities
. Kennedy provides a welcoming atmosphere in which parents and 
community members are encouraged to become involved in students' educational endeavors. Individual 
academic and social needs of staff and students are met, creating a desirable environment wher
e all 
participants are successful.  One way to promote success for all is through a character education program.  At 
Kennedy, we implement a self
-
designed character education program called "Kennedy's Kids of Character" 
that focuses on 10 character traits:
 
respect, responsibility, caring, honesty, teamwork, fairness, courtesy, 
gratitude, integrity and self
-
control.  Each month a new trait is highlighted.  The entire school staff focuses 
activities and recognition of these traits.
 
 
"Healthy Bodies, Healthy M
inds" is a current focus at Kennedy.  In 2010 
-
 
2011, we received the Silver Level 
National Award from the Alliance for a Healthier Generation organization.  We have worked on improving 
healthy eating and increasing physical activity for students and staff
.  Through a grant sponsored by the 
American Federation of Teachers Union, we have in place our A.I.M. Program ( Active 
-
 
Involved 
-
Motivated).  
We have an established before and after school Clubs: Sports Club, Track Club, Rocket Club, Digital Music Club,
 
Cheer leading Club, Art Club and Drama Club.  Most activities are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Numerous 
students and staff participate regularly throughout the year.  In addition, we offer a club to our English 
Learners, Imagine Learning Club in the m
orning.
 
 
We are committed to not only instructing rigorous academics, but also extending opportunities in the 
performing, as well.  This is demonstrated by our music and dance program that our parents and PTA support, 

y practices and much preparation, this group presents a meticulously 
choreographed, school
-
wide musical performance for two nights.  Previous show themes have included a 
tribute to Michael Jackson, "A Journey through Oz.",  Dr. Seuss, classic rock
-
and
-
roll
 
favorites, Step in Time, 
and I Love the 80's.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
Kennedy STEM Academy perseveres in cultivating people of character who become productive, responsible, 
lifelong learners through a respectful partnership with parents, students, staff, and th
e community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satis
fy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Throughout the year, we plan with PTA a Family Fun Night at a business in our community (ie. McDonald's, Chuck E. Cheese,  Br
usters, etc.).  The funds 
we raise with the company's assistance are used to provide stud

and field trips.  Families have consistently commented positively on these events and enjoy the opportunity to socialize with
 
other families and staff from 
our school.

Our teachers actively seek 
opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction with the focus on student learning.  Staff development
 
is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel. Staff members work collaboratively to determine the school's needs an
d tak
e direction from 
District and State requirements when establishing professional development goals for the school year.  Schoolwide training fo
cus areas include 
technology, differentiation, PBIS, Common Core ELA and Math, and using data to drive instruction
. Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by 
participating in many conferences and workshops throughout the year and by sharing their experiences and knowledge with colle
agues. The District 
offers professional development funds to school sites for
 
professional development activities. S.T.E.M and Common Core are examples of professional 
development areas teachers have attended workshops on.
