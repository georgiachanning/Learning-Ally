By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Founded in 1993, Princeton Street Elementary School is a pre
-
school through 5th grade school consisting of approximately 
433 pupils located in the northeast section of Delano, California, on 
the corner of Princeton Street and 20th Avenue and 
provides educational services to pre
-
school through 5th grade students. The school mascot is a knight and the school 
colors are purple and teal.
 
 
Princeton Street Elementary School has formed a strong prof

school goals are:
 

 
All students will be reading
 
at, or close to, grade level by the end of second grade.
 

 
All students will receive intervention when not preforming at grade level in Math and ELA.
 

 

-
practices for reading instruction to include: small group instruction
, use 
of supplemental materials, sentence frames, checking for understanding, fluency practice, RTI, and increased 
use of technology.
 

 
All English Learners take the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) for the 2019
-
2020 
school yea
r. The assessment data will be used to help move our English Learners toward English Language 
Proficiency.
 

 

language skill objectives, 
grouping of English Learners by language level for designated ELD instruction, pushing 
students to higher levels of English language usage and practice, student collaboration, students producing 50
-
70% of the talking during ELD lessons, support of ELD less
ons with visuals, realia, graphic organizers, and 
modeling throughout the instructional day.
 

 

 
Vision
: We are a strong professional learning community (PLC) that
 
effectively collaborates with staff, families, and the 
community to achieve student success. 
 
 
Mission
: Our students will develop values, knowledge, skills, goals, and the self
-
confidence to be continuous learners,

Princeton Street Elementary School was originally built in 1993. The school has a total of 32 classrooms (16 permanen
t 
and 16 portable), one music room, one computer lab, one literacy room, one RSP room, a multi
-
purpose facility, a 
library/resource room, an administration office, a PE equipment room (room 6), and a building used by the county to 
provide physical therapy 
services (room 33). Additional portable classrooms were constructed in 1994, 1997, and 1998. 
Our playground and field areas are spacious and are continually monitored by staff and administration for student safety.
 
 
The district takes concerted efforts to 
ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. District maintenance staff 
ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. 
All bathrooms, classrooms, and office are cleaned d
aily. Students are encouraged to help keep the campus clean by 
recycling and picking up after themselves. A work order process called School Dude is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The Maintenance
, Operations, and Transportation Department 
works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean safe schools.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades th
ree 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the mo
st significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education seq

Princeton Street 


(SSC) and/or English Lear
ner Advisory Committee (ELAC). These two venues are the primary means for disseminating 
information to parents. The following guidelines will be used to increase parent involvement: 
 

 
A meeting will be held monthly with the SSC and a minimum of four ELAC me
etings will be held throughout the 
academic year. Parents will be informed and participate with the Title 1 expenditures. The budget will be an 
agenda item at all meetings. The meetings will be held at a time that is conducive to maximize parental 
involvem
ent.
 

 
At all SSC and ELAC meetings, parents will be given the opportunity to make suggestions and share concerns 
regarding all school programs. Any concerns brought to the attention of the site administrator(s) will be 
addressed promptly and in compliance w
ith the Uniform Complaint Procedure.
 

 
Through the SSC and ELAC meetings, parents will have the opportunity to provide input in the development of 
the Single School Plan and the School Parent Involvement Policy as well. The meetings are open to all parents 
a
nd community members.
 

 
Copies of the annual School Accountability Report Cards (SARC) will be made available to parents promptly after 
its publication.
 

 
The school website (www.duesd.org/princeton) provides parents and families access to the following 
inform
ation; SSC, ELAC, SARC, the Safety Plan, and support materials.
 

 
Student individual assessment results are provided to all parents of students assessed. In addition, teachers will 
discuss assessment results with parents at Back to School Night, and during f
ormal and informal parent 
conferences. Teachers will share results of interim assessments with parents on a regular basis.
 

 
All teachers utilize the school planners daily as a means of regular communication with families.
 

 
Parent newsletters, school website,
 
school facebook page, and the school digital marquee located at the front 
of the school site are updated regularly as a means of disseminating information to parents and families.
 

 
At the beginning of the year, orientation and parent 
conferences, a description and explanation of the 
curriculum, forms of assessment, and expected student proficiency levels will be provided to the parents.
 

 
Continued emphasis will be placed on increasing accessibility to parents of English Learners and stu
dents with 
disabilities.
 

 
Parents of students at risk in academics, behavior, or attendance will be invited to participate in meetings where 
support and intervention strategies will be provided.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Princeton Street School Safety plan is reviewed  and updated yearly. For the 2019
-
2020 school year, the safety plan 
was reviewed on July 25, 2019. Among 
many other components and information, our safety plan includes information on 
topics such as the School Climate Assessment, Crisis Response team plans, school safety laws, information on our Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Supports Team (MTSS), fire drills and em
ergency protocols and behavior expectations to maintain a safe 

-
being of our students.  Our first goal is to provide a safe, orderly, se
cure campus conducive to learning.  In addition, we 
will provide an environment where students, staff, parents and the community feel a sense of self, school and community 
pride.  Other goals are to improve overall attendance rates, developing an academic 
program with high expectations, and 
creating an atmosphere where each individual will be treated with dignity and respect, and their ethnic, cultural and 
religious backgrounds will be appreciated.  Furthermore, our goals include complying with school safet
y laws, following a 
uniformed district discipline policy and working collaboratively with parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, counselors, 
and community agencies, including law enforcement.

Princeton Street School implementation plan consists of hav
ing monthly fire, evacuation and reverse evacuation drills, a 
Crisis Response Team who has reviewed their duties and are prepared, and a staff who is observant during non
-
instructional times throughout the day.   In addition, we have an MTSS team whose goa
ls include improving the character 
of students, teaching behavior expectations and improving the overall school climate.  We do this by having behavior 
expectation assemblies, anti
-
bullying assemblies and implementing the Character Counts program.  Princet
on Street 
School recognizes behavior in a positive way and reteaches behavior expectations as needed.  We have incentives in place 
for attendance which include end of the year field trips, trimester awards and incentives.  Our grade level teachers meet 
on 
a weekly basis to plan curriculum and lesson plans, and teachers participate in professional development throughout 
the academic year.  Also, our school participates in the district/community safety committee, where we participate and 
develop plans to ensu
re a safe and orderly environment. Princeton Street School is committed to reaching our goals and 
improving the overall safety for our students.  To meet these goals, there is a lot of action that needs to take place, and 
the school safety plan is essentia
l in helping us reach our goals.

At Princeton Street School, we participated in several areas for staff development. One focus for Princeton was in the area 
of reading. One of our school goals was to have 75
-
% of our students reading at grade level as measured by the Analytical 
Reading in
ventory. We also looked at SBAC data and found that we needed to address literacy as well. As a result, our 
staff has participated in professional development literacy including phonemic awareness, decoding, reading intervention, 
and progress monitoring pr
esented by district personnel. We have also received professional development in decoding 
and blending using multi sensory strategies presented by our site intervention teacher. We have also provided reading 
intervention professional development for our in
structional aides as they assist teachers with reading intervention for our 
struggling readers in both push
-
in and pull
-
out formats. We have also purchased reading intervention material to be used 
for our struggling readers and made it available for all an
d teachers and instructional aides to access.

Another area of focus for Princeton Street School is in the area of ELD. In an effort to close the gap between our English 
learners and our school wide student population, our staff has participated in profess
ional development in designated 
and integrated ELD instruction presented by our district Director of ELD, Elva Hennesse and our ELD coaches. We have 
also sent staff for ELD training at the county level as well. In July, 2016, our staff participated in prof
essional development 
in the area of academic language and strategies for English language learners presented by Kate Kinsella, and we have had 
our district ELD coaches present academic language strategies to our staff at our school site and for individual 
teachers 
and grade levels as needed. Support with material for our English learners and data is also provided to our teachers by 
our site resource teacher. In 2018, our ELD coaches have provided several professional development trainings for our staff 
in t
he areas collaboration, text reconstruction, listening and speaking as well as in
-
class coaching. We are have also been 
provided training i the use of thinking maps across the content areas.
 
 
Using our SBAC results, we saw a need to improve in math as well
. As a result, we have sent staff to a math symposium at 
CSU Bakersfield. In 2016, we sent 6 teachers to the Putting It All Together 4 day math training at the Tulare County Office 
of Education and have sent the remainder of our staff for the 2017
-
18 schoo
l year. The training focused on understanding 
and using the math standard targets and claims to help prepare effective math lessons for our pupils and learn effective 
instructional strategies. Our site also has one teacher per grade level that participates
 
in a district curriculum development 
team called Curriculum Facilitators. These staff members share instructional strategies and best practices they have 
learned with their site grade level teams, and they plan together to implement these practices into t
heir math lessons. In 
2018, we have received several trainings lead by out district director of data analysis in the area of data review, interim 
assessments, sub
-
group identification, and math intervention.
 
 
In 2018, we have also received training in the 
area of safety through a joint collaboration with our district safety director 
and local police department where we discussed campus and student safety as well as situational/scenario review.  Other 
professional development that we have participated in pla
ce include, but not limited to, PBIS, writing, small group 
instruction, Benchmark Advanced Curriculum Training, Illuminate (our data & assessment platform), School Wide 
Universal Screener Tool, Child Abuse Reporting, Explicit Direct Instruction, Daily
-

fe, and Math
-
Fact Fluency, Teacher 
Summer Institute, Word Problem Workshop, Claims and Targets Training, and Math Talks Fraction Workshop. Princeton 
Street School is committed to providing relevant professional development to further the competency of our 
instructional 
staff to better serve our pupils.
