School Description
 
Mission Statement
 
The faculty and staff of Cabot Yerxa Elementary School believe that each child is a unique, valuable 
individual who is capable of learning and succeeding. We further believe that the participation, 
communication, and cooperation with the home and the commu
nity at large are critical for student 
success in school. Recognizing the special needs of our multicultural, language diverse population, 
we practice a variety of best practice instructional strategies, all while promoting district and state 
goals for edu
cational development and facilitating the growth of productive members of our 
society.
 
 
The School
 
Cabot Yerxa Elementary School opened in the beginning of the 2009
-
2010 school year. The school 
is located in Desert Hot Springs, a community in the Coachella
 
Valley and is one of the sixteen 
elementary schools in the Palm Springs Unified School District. The school is serving approximately 
700 students in transitional kindergarten through fifth grade. Our campus is also home to the 
Therapeutic Educational Prog
ram (TEP), which services students who struggle to maintain in the 
general education setting.
 
 
Title 1
 
Cabot Yerxa Elementary is a Title I school site. All students are monitored regularly to ensure that 
their needs in reading and mathematics are being met
 
through classroom practices and targeted 
interventions. Title I funds are used to support an Academic Coach, Extended Day Interventions 
and professional development opportunities, which serve to allow us to more effectively target the 
individual needs of 
our students.  This year, we continue to refine our engagement strategies in the 
classroom that promote more collaboration among peers to strengthen speaking and listening 
skills, which in turn support the areas of reading and writing.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each ye
ar, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF
) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorit
ies. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement is a priority at Cabot Yerxa. For children to be successful in school, parent participation is an essentia
l component for student success 
and student achievement. Many
 
opportunities to become involved are provided throughout the school year.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to attend School Site Council (SSC) meetings and if interested, can run for elected positions. This is
 
a great opportunity for the 
school community to come t
ogether to chart the school's path to improvement. Information is presented at Back to School Night and flyers for each 
meeting are sent home. Interested individuals can contact Miss Gascoigne at 760
-
251
-
2223. Cabot Yerxa also has an English Language Advis
ory 
Committee (ELAC) committee. All parents are encouraged to attend the meetings. Issues related to the academic performance and
 
needs of the English 
Language Learners are addressed at the ELAC meetings. Interested individuals can contact Ms. Diaz at 760
-
251
-
2223. Parents and Staff Members have 
reestablished the PTA at Cabot Yerxa. The PTA is a formal organization composed of parents, teachers and staff that is intend
ed to facilitate parental 
participation in our school. The current board is working dilige
ntly to grow their membership and increase parent activities. Interested individuals can 
stop into the office for contact information.
 
 
Our Back to School Night is held the night before school starts, which allows parents to meet their child's teacher. We 
also offer parents the opportunity 
to attend parent conferences, which are held twice during the year. Another piece we strongly encourage are our family nights
, which focus on reading, 
math, and other subject areas. Parents and students attend and work co
llaboratively to see what skills they can practice at home. We also host a 
technology night for our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade parents as those grade levels participate in the 24/7 program which allows th
ese students the opportunity 
to take their devices home 
and continue working on class assignments. Parent sessions are also offered through the PSUSD Parent Center on site 
throughout the year on a variety of topics.
 
 
Parent surveys will be available for parents to complete annually to provide input. Parents wil
l also be invited to the awards assemblies that will be held 
at the end of each trimester, recognizing students for their accomplishments.

School Safety Plan
 
Cabot Yerxa Elementary is dedicated to ensuring that we have and maintain a safe campus where we are building a true sense of
 
community 
within the 
school. The staff at Cabot Yerxa makes every effort to keep students safe on school grounds before, during, and after the sch
ool day has ended. The 
school day begins at 8:40 a.m. Students are allowed on campus beginning at 8:20 a.m. with supervi
sion provided. Staff members supervise all students 
at the student pick up zones at the end of the school day. All gates to the school are locked during the school day. Any volu
nteers must first sign a 
volunteer form, be screened through the Megan's Law we
b site, and report to the office to sign in before being allowed on campus. All visitors must sign 
in in the office and wear a visitor badge with their picture at all times.
 
 
Our Safe School Plan is evaluated and updated each year by our Safe School Commit
tee. Fire Drills are conducted each month. Lockdown drills, 
earthquake drills and active shooter drills are practiced at various times during the year. Any concerns or needs for improve
ment are discussed at 
leadership meetings with grade level leads.
 
 
Our 
plan consists of two Components:
 
 
Component 1
-
 
People and Programs
 
Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS)
 
Playworks Recess Program

Each year we have designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best 
practices and discussions with teachers and 
principals. The specific approaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instruction to Smarter Balanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Ta
rgets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years. The professional development in these areas was provided by the Schoolhouse Proje
ct. In 2017
-
18 the 
teachers continued working 
with High Impact Math consultants. They began working with the consultants during the 2016
-
17 school year. This 

e course of three y
ears; 
however, Cabot Yerxa has extended the learning to Year 4.  During Year 1 (2016
-
17) the focus was on developing strategies to support number sense by 
implementing mental math routines and highlight the landscape of learning in mathematics. During Year
 
2 (2017
-
18) the focus was on strengthening 
mental math routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implementing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). During 
Year 3 (2018
-
19) the focus was on coverage vs teaching for u
nderstanding through the three
-
part lesson design. This professional development also 
supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math program (Bridges in Mathematics and Number Corner). During the 2019
-
20 
school year the focus of the
 
training are identifying problems and practice and differentiation.
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 12 days of ELA training in 2017
-
18. For 2018
-
19 there are 6 full days for ELA. For the 2019
-
20 school year there 
are 8 days for ELA and the remain
ing number of days in 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 are full days of professional learning for math.
