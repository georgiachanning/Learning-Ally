By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We are a school proud to serve 700 young learners from north San Diego County. As a primary school, we strive to support 
the growth of the whole child in building the social emotional and academic skills to prepare them fo
r college,
 
career and 
community. Our school improvement plan builds on the strong practices we have established over the past several years. 
We will continue to refine and develop instructional practices, emphasizing critical thinking.
  
Our goal is for eac
h lesson to 
have a clear purpose with teacher modeling and questioning to support student access to grade level content. Our teams 
will continue to come together during Exploration days to collaborate and plan for science, literacy and math instruction 
usi
ng sound instructional practices.
  
Every person has a right to feel safe and engaged at Highland Ranch.
 
 
We respect and 
affirm the cultures and differences that make up our school community. Everyone belongs at Highland Ranch Elementary 
School. In addition
 
to our amazing students, the incredibly dedicated staff and families are what contribute to making our 
school thrive. As a school that serves students, aged preschool to fifth grade, we are able to keep focused on the 
foundational skills students need to 
be
 
successful throughout their lives. We have made great progress with our students' 
scores on standardized tests,
 
and the continuation of meaningfully using this data to inform our school's direction.
 
 
Highland Ranch is a school with a mission to have mot
ivated students, enthusiastic teachers, and engaged parents who 
come together to prepare Stallions for their future.
 
 
 
As our enthusiasm as educators is a key factor in motivating our 
students, we reflect on our instructional practices.
   
This year, our te
achers are asking these important questions:
 
 
If 
students are accountable for their learning, what can we, as educators, expect to see?
 
 
 
If we want our students to be 
accountable, what will we have to provide to them?
 
 
 
 
We realize that our school environ
ment must be one which lends itself to accountability for our actions, and our students 
responsibility for their actions.
 
 
 
To this end, our Positive Behavior Support Team will provide strategies for our staff, 
resources for parents, and positive lessons f
or our students.
 
 
 
We have three school rules: 
 
Be Safe, Be Kind, Be 
Responsible. 
 
 
Our Values are the Character Counts Pillars of Trustworthy, Respect, Responsible, Fairness, Caring and 
Citizenship.
 
 
It is our expectation that all members of staff, studen
ts, and parents uphold these values.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities
 
Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning sc
hedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, re
strooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offic
es.

Highland 
Ranch recognizes the importance of the partnership between home and school and remains committed to 
supporting the Parents as Partners Core Value. Parents have been included in the improvement process and serve in an 
advisory capacity on committees. 
 
Our s
chool's Foundation and PTA work cooperatively as "The Power of Two" and 
promote a culture of shared responsibility and celebration! 
 
 
Everything from school supplies to a PE and Science teacher 
are funded by these two groups. 
 
Parent volunteers work in a v
ariety of capacities above and beyond 
ongoing fund raising 
functions. 
 
Our parents enthusiastically volunteer in our Vo
lunteer Workroom, Fall Festival, Variety Show, Run for the Ranch, 
Variety Show, Book Fairs, Fun Run, Classroom Support, School Pictures, 
Hearing and Vision Screenings, Kindergarten and 
Continuing Student Registration, School Newsletter, Library and Book Room. 
 
 
We value the need for fine arts and provide 
school
-
wide opportunities for all children to participate in Arts Attack. 
 
Additionally
, in the performing arts, we have Choir 
and Stallion Singers as after school clubs available to all grade levels. 
 
Our parents also volunteer to promote strong 
academic skills.
 
 
This year a dedicated team of parents continues the tutoring program for our f
irst and second grade 
students in the Everyone a Reader program. 
 
 
Parents also help to determine site direction. 
 
Our team for Site Council 
consists of five parents who are dedicated to the success of students, and provide insight and input on how to impr
ove 
our school. 
 
 
We believe that when home and school work together it can only benefit our students.

Research supports the positive effects professional development has on increasing student learning. All staff is afforded 
the opportunity to participate in district and site sponsored professional development. 
 
Teachers may participate in "TLC" 
opportuniti
es. 
 
These Teacher Learning Cooperatives are designed to meet the needs of the teacher as it relates to site 
and grade goals. These include the use of effective instructional strategies, implementing the use of computer technology 
in teaching and learning,
 
critical reading, writing and mathematics strategies, effective use of assessments, positive 
discipline in
-
services, and multicultural training.
 
 
 
Since 2016, we have used the Xplore time for our staff and students. This 
Xplore time allows teachers collab
orative time, seventeen sessions per year, during the school day to research best 
practices and assess student progress. 
 
Students, meanwhile, are afforded the opportunity to have instruction in Science, 
Art, or PE with a fully credentialed teacher. 
 
Teach
ers and administrators are actively involved in professional development 
activities at the site and district level. The Poway Professional Assistance Program (PPAP) provides support for new 
teachers that provides teachers with coach to help them effectivel
y meet the Continuum of Professional Standards.
