About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Repo
rt Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountabil
ity Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CD
E LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a 
comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and in
structional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we establish
ed district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
h
e Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by
 
a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional 
development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessm
ent for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are fo
cused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher I
nduction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framewor
k 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and t
heir Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve t
heir assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a w
hole is enhanced.
