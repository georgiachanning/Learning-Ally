By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The 18 classes in the main building of the school and the administration 
building all underwent modernization in 2009. 
The classrooms have received upgraded electrical service, improved teaching furnishings, and regular ongoing technology 
upgrades. In addition, the modernization project addressed State Code Accessibility by pro
viding accessible restroom 
facilities, accessible working space and sinks in classrooms, panic hardware at doors, door thresholds, accessible drinking 
fountains, and path of travel including ramps and curb cuts, passenger loading zone, bus drop
-
off, access
ible parking, and 
signage. The Multipurpose Room (MPR) is utilized daily for food service distribution during breakfast and lunch for all 
students as well as for school
-
wide events for students and families. There is a teaching space on the MPR stage and a
n 
assembly area to hold large school
-
wide events with a capacity of 507. The MPR is also utilized as an alternative location 
for inclement weather recesses. The MPR also serves and supports our Think Together after
-
school program in whatever 
capacity that 
is needed daily or on identified Saturdays. There were no planned or completed facility improvement 
projects during the 2017/2018 school year.
 
 
The school facility offers a good learning environment with fully functioning lighting, heating and cooling syst
ems, and 
noise negation. Internet access which is available in the office and all classrooms and was updated during the 2017
-

e to Hawthorne along with purchasing guidelines and the following purchases were made: 
upgraded technology (school
-
wide), instructional computer programs and walkie
-
talkies to expand staff communication 
and ensure school
-
wide safety.
 
 
Student Safety
 
 
Stude
nts are supervised immediately before and after school by staff. Security gates have been installed at the front of 
the school. Hawthorne is a closed campus. All students, parents and other visitors enter the school through the front gates 
each morning. Te
achers have been directed to keep their classroom doors locked at all times throughout the instructional 
day. Clearly, defined boundary lines are visible to all students to indicate accessible student zones to ensure appropriate 
supervision. All visitors a
re asked to check in at the front office through the Raptor security system and must wear a visitor 
badge to show that they have done so. District employees and substitutes all wear district
-
issued identification badges 
and must also check in at the front 
office through the Raptor system. Students who leave early must be checked out 
through the front office by parents or guardians. All staff members are diligent about being aware of adults on campus at 
all times. Visitors without visitor badges are escorted
 
to the office. Monthly fire, earthquake and lockdown drills are 
conducted so that students and staff have an opportunity to practice in the case of an actual disaster. A schedule of 
emergency drills is submitted to the district office prior to the beginni
ng of each school year. W e have an identified 
location where we keep all of our emergency supplies. All supplies are regularly inventoried.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the distric
t and Hawthorne School is 
maintained in a manner that ensures it is clean, in good repair and working order. The principal works directly with the 
custodial staff and district office to develop cleaning schedules to ensure all classrooms, offices, and rest
rooms are cleaned 
daily. Restroom checks are done periodically and documented throughout the day to ensure clean, well
-
maintained 
accessibility to all students and staff. Efforts are made to keep the school litter and graffiti
-
free by daily walk
-
throughs f
or 
campus checks and student awareness. The principal and custodian work together to maintain a clean and orderly campus. 
Hawthorne school has many murals throughout the campus that have been painted by local artists, parent volunteers and 
students. Many o
f the murals depict standard based instruction that Hawthorne teachers provide daily.

The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. Site and district maintenance and 
grounds staff make sure that the work necess
ary to keep the school in good repair and aesthetically pleasing are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. The floors, walls, and plumbing system ar
e all in exemplary condition. To complete the FIT 
report, Operations Department conducts an annual in
-
depth evaluation of each school to determine the condition of the 
facilities and identify situations that need maintenance, repair or an upgrade. The dist
rict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction to assist with the data gathering during the 
inspections.
 
 
The most recent Williams' Inspection occurred on August 16, 2019. The visit was desc
ribed as "a positive, professional 
experience with a focus by the entire staff on seeking to improve the learning of each student at Hawthorne Elementary 
School. In regards to Instructional Materials, no inefficiencies were observed. For School Facilities 
there were no extreme 
deficiencies observed.  The following good repair deficiencies were observed and were all remedied on the same day of

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Building capacity in the Hawthorne staff is a high priority. Hawthorne Elementary School is an authorized International 
Baccalaureate (IB) World School and therefore ensures that all staff receives the required training. Another high priority 
in staff deve
lopment for the Hawthorne staff continues to be in the area of Common Core Standards for both ELA and in 
Math. Continued training in the focus areas of student engagement, PLCs, PBIS, ELD, ELA, math and technology and are 
also a high priority. Training and
 
school
-
wide initiatives will continue to occur in the areas of IB, Instructional Rounds, PBIS, 
Concept
-
Based Learning and other strategies that support student achievement. Professional development is based on 
district initiatives and data results from st
udent performance, as well as site Leadership Team decisions. All students are 
assessed regularly using formative assessments and assessment results are discussed at PLCs. It is during that time that a 
review and interpretation of all student data occurs. 
Release time is provided so that teachers in all grade levels are able 
to work closely with the site instructional coaches and administration in developing instructional next steps along with 
identifying students who would benefit from intervention opportu
nities. Grade level goals and intensive instruction are 
agreed upon for classroom teaching.
