Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To 
keep students safe on school grounds before, during, and after the school day, we have instituted several safety 
programs. The first is to ensure that the adults on duty during recess carry the necessary emergency equipment with them 
so that it is possible
 
to administer first aid quickly. Secondly, we have varied the entry and exit routes, which are known 
and practiced daily.
 
 
We have adults posted at each entrance  to ensure that students are safe. All personnel wear badges and students know 
and 
report any adult on campus who is not wearing a badge. To get on the campus during the day, adults must check in 
at the office and are given a badge to wear, so the students know that this person has gone through the proper channels. 
The FDR Leadership Tea
m and School Site Council finalized the procedure for the emergency drills, in the event of a 
disaster.
 
 
Our discipline policy focuses on consistency, clear expectations and follow through within the classroom and ongoing 
communication with our families.  
We are implementing PBIS 
-
 
Positive Behavior Intervention Support 
-
 
this is a more 
positive school
-
wide discipline plan in order to create a friendlier environment for our students and families.  In order to 
meet the needs of our students, FDR offers progr
ams to help students feel connected by providing Before or After School 
Activities, Monthly Award Assemblies and Fun Fitness Activities. FDR school honors students for high achievement, 
citizenship and improvement. Each teacher is expected to have a plan f
or the classroom environment and we have a full 
time School Social Worker and interns available  to counsel students.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a time
ly manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. The Maintenance Department responds to our needs in a timely manner. The district governing 
board has adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school 
office and at the district office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure
 
a clean and safe school. The custodial st
aff cleans restrooms and classrooms daily as inspected by the site administration 
on a weekly basis.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was adopted in February, 2000. We have reviewed it every year since with the 

ite Council to  sure that it is still viable. The Safety Plan was last discussed 
with all staff in October 2019. The key components of the plan include three different drills and the chain of command in 
the case of an emergency. In addition, the plan detai
ls what chemical and poisons are prohibited at school. It also lists the 
various safe practices for students inside and out of the classroom. Universal bell schedules were implemented in 2004 so 
that emergency bell signals are the same at all schools. Each
 
classroom has a safety backpack which stays with the teacher 
during emergencies. Emergency drills for fire, earthquake, and other emergencies are held on a regular basis.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The LESD Education Services team in 
collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, Math TOSAs, English Language 
Instructional Resource Teachers and Principals have designed a comprehensive system for monthly professional 
development.  All district professional development occurs on Thursd
ays after school following an early release day.   
Topics are selected based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  All professional development in 
the LESD focuses on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the i
mplementation of research based 
practices to support student achievement.
 
 
Professional development focuses on the instructional shifts needed to meet the rigorous demands of the Common Core 
State Standards and the need to support development of academic d
iscourse for all students, with an emphasis on English 
language learners.  All TK
-
5th grade teachers receive professional development support in the areas of social
-
emotional 
learning, Math warm
-
ups, and integrated ELD. Collaboration time is spent on data 
analysis and planning in the areas of 
English Language Arts, Math, and ELD. Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles that afford them 
the opportunity to learn about a new concept, plan for implementation with their colleagues, practic
e their learning with 
students, and then come back with their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional 
implementation of the new skill.
 
 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the professional development is regularly collecte
d to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team members regularly 
visit classrooms to determine the level of implementation of the professional development focus.
