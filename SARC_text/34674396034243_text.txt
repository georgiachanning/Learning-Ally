About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members shoul

The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teac
hers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curr
icular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardians and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for ado
ption. 
Recommendations for the adoption an
d/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 
3) exterior painting, or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district school

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of 
study

by a parent/guardian, 
whose membership of ten includes five parents/guardians. Many of the ed

of parent/guardian involvement.
 
 
In addition, many of our teaching staff members have an open door policy, where they are available to meet with parents/guard

Teacher Conferences occur twice per year, and Progress Reports are sent home

Kindergarten Orientation occurs every year prior to the 
start of school to welcome our new students and their families, as well as to inform them of 
involvement opportunities. Some of these include classroom support, docent opportunities, chaperoning field trips, and volunt

Book Fairs, B

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
