Our Mission Statement
 
W
e currently follow the Hemet USD Mission: 
"Embrace. Educate. Empower."
 
 
Our Vision Statement
 
At Little Lake Elementary we are motivated by this belief: students and their families hold the power 
to reinvent themselves and their world. They must be given the opportunity to develop a strong 
sense of
 
self, a commitment to social responsibility and the academic agility needed to improve 
themselves and their community. Education should not be the repository of the status quo. Rather, 
it should be an instrument for freedom, teaching students how to deal 
effectively with the world 
and to help transform it.We believe in the power of the individual and the power of community. 
We are dedicated to providing a nurturing, challenging and creative learning environment that 
celebrates diversity with compassion and
 
acceptance.
 
 
School Profile
 
Little Lake Elementary was established in 1899. We are proud of our heritage and our long standing 
tradition of a commitment to excellence. This is appropriately reflected in our HUSD Mission 
Statement: "Embrace. 
Educate. Empower." We are committed to a child centered learning 
environment with the highest level of excellence in teaching, learning, and positive behavior.
 
 
Currently, Little Lake has 37 active classrooms. Twenty
-
nine classrooms are utilized for genera
l 
education classes in grades TK thru 5th and eight classrooms are utilized for special education. Four 
of the special education classes are Moderate
-
Sever, Functional Skills elementary and preschool 
programs which draw their attendance from both inside an
d outside our school boundaries.
 
 
To effectively maintain our high teacher expectations as well as continually strive to exceed them, 
change is inevitable and our staff is learning that collaboration is essential.
 
 

has grown to over 100 members with more than 800 years 
of successful teaching experience. To maintain a Tradition of Excellence, our Little Lake staff 
continues to hone skills through collaboration, staff development. This dedication drives our 
instruction
.
 
 
We provide rigorous academics that stress flexibility of thought as well as a social
-
emotional 
approach that emphasizes empathy among all members of our school community. We know that 
emotional intelligence is strongly correlated to success in life, bot
h personally and professionally. 
We believe that the best students are complete humans. Children come first at Little Lake 
Elementary.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Ava
ilability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss curre
nt issues relevant to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highligh
ts of the 
available materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommen
ded textbook.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community
 
stakeholders, for review and approval.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English learn
ers, kindergarten through grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Sec
tion 60210, which allows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (CCSS
).  The 

content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instructio
nal materials be deemed to be aligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks,
 
instructional materials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
standa
rds or the 2010 CCSS standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In ac
cordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the district,
 
including English learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional materials in each of the areas listed below:

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the
