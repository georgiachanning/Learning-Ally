About This School
 
W
inchester 
Elementary School is located six miles southwest of Hemet in Winchester, California. 
Tradition is evident at Winchester Elementary School. There are many second and third generation 
families who have attended W.E.S. The first two
-
story school was built in 
1884 on three acres in 
Pleasant Valley. Since that time the site has moved and several buildings have been constructed, 
which currently allows for our expected growth in student population.  We have been at our school 
site for over 125 years.
 
 
We have a hi

degrees and others with multiple teaching credentials and supplemental authorizations. We have 
outstanding and supportive parents who take the education of their children very
 
seriously and are 
willing to get involved to help improve our school. Our District administration and Governing Board 
consistently work to support the school staff in maintaining a high level of program effectiveness.
 
 
Winchester Elementary School 
maintains a positive learning climate. It is staffed with goal driven, 
proactive, and compassionate teachers who seek out resources within the school and parent 


Winchester is one of approximately 235 schools in the nation that is part of  the "No Excuses" 
Network of schools and is considered a "No Excuses University" School!  This is our fourth year 
being part of AVID Elementary, preparing all students to gain 
the skills to go on to college.
 
 

 
Our mission at Winchester Elementary School is to develop the knowledge and academic skills 
necessary for students to advance to schools of higher learning, and become educated, productive, 
re
sponsible citizens.
 
 
Vision
 
We envision a school in which staff CREATES
 
 
Collaborates respectfully
 
Responsibly uses best instructional practices
 
Employs clear and consistent expectations and consequences
 
Assesses and monitors each student's 
progress
 
Teams with parents and community to
 
Enthusiastically place
 
Students first!
 
 

 
It is truly an honor to be the leader at Winchester Elementary School 
-
 
a school rich in history and 
tradition.
 
 
It is my pleasure to be the principal 
at Winchester Elementary School. W.E.S. is a team of students, 
staff, parents, and community all working together to provide a successful educational experience 
for our children.  As the proverb goes "It takes a village to raise a child", we firmly believe
 
in 
embracing, empowering and educating the "whole" child.

Our students benefit from our strong curriculum, which includes music, physical education, math, and a balanced literacy prog

g curriculum coupled along with creative use of technology, our years of 
successful teaching experience, ongoing collaborative planning and high student expectations continue to support all of our s
tudents.  All 
school based decisions are data driven with 
a student focus.
 
 
Our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and Parent Teacher Association (PTA) represent our many parent volunteers. Par
ents 
and the community are an integral part of Winchester Elementary. These groups support varied programs for st
udents including 
educational assemblies, materials for the classrooms, field trips, and our annual Fall and Spring Festivals.  With ongoing su

to continue to show outstanding student growth and achievement.

About the SARC
 
By Feb
ruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SAR
C). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Fun
ding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state
 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the s
chool, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A District committee considers textbooks for recommendatio
n on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss current issues relevant to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbook
s, and instructional 
methods.  The com
mittee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the various highligh
ts of the 
available materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a reco
mmended textbook.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and community stakeholders, for review and approval.  If the text
book is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to t
he Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.  Each 
pupil in the district, including English learners, kindergarten through grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are cons
istent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code Section 60210, which allows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with 
the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS
).  The 

c content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instructional materials be deemed to be a
ligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent wit
h the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textbooks, instructional materials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combi
nation of any such materials 
are aligned to the content s

standards or the 2010 CCSS standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements. 
 
In accordan
ce with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the district, includi
ng English learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
