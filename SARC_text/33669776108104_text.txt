School Description
 
You are invited to explore 
Valley View Elementary School's Annual School Accountability Report 
Card, which provides valuable information about our school's instructional programs, academic 
achievement, classroom materials, school safety, facilities, and staff. Understanding our 
educ
ational program, student achievement, and curriculum development can assist both our 
school and the community in ongoing program improvement.
 
 
Valley View Elementary School is located in the central region of Riverside and serves students in 
grades kinderg
arten through five following a traditional calendar and is focused on providing all 
students with the opportunity to achieve. We accommodate individual learning styles while 
maintaining high, obtainable, expectations for students. Did you know that Valley 
View is one of 
two Alvord elementary schools offering Spanish Dual Language Immersion classes? Dual Language 
Immersion began at Valley View in 2015
-
16. As our program expands one grade level each year, by 
2020
-
2021, Valley View will be offering the gift of
 
bi
-
literacy to grades kindergarten through fifth. 
Our highly attended extended learning (After school) program provides intervention time for at
-
risk students and extracurricular activities that actively engage all students and provide a well
-
rounded educ
ational experience. Students are motivated with a variety of goal setting; school
-
wide, grade level, and individually. Student academic achievement and adherence to school wide 
expectations is recognized and rewarded daily in classrooms and on the playgrou
nd and multi
-
purpose room with Campus Supervisors. End of semester academic, behavior, and perfect 
attendance awards are awarded twice annually. Second Step is our behavior and character building 
curriculum which encourages students to be the best that the
y can be. Valley View Elementary 
School is quite proud to be recognized as an AVID Elementary site where we prepare all students 
for college and career using AVID strategies of: writing though note
-
taking, organization skills, 
collaboration, use of inquiry
, and reading to learn. In 2019
-
2020, Valley View joined the No Excuses 
University Networks of schools due to our beliefs of NEU's 6 exceptional systems which strengthen 
our current values and beliefs being "all children deserve the right to attend a colle
ge or university 
should they choose to." Our college going culture is the foundation of all that we do and why our 
school motto is "Leading the Way. Leading the Future!"
 
 
A loving, collaborative partnership between the school and families exists to create 
a learning 
environment that promotes academic and social development, teaches responsibility and positive 
character attributes, and models learning as a lifelong adventure. We are excited about our school 
and welcome all to join in our efforts to create re
sponsible citizens full of purpose.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

maintenance staff makes repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work
ing order. A district

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priorit

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students 
in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.

however, the number of students tested is 
not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

All staff members participate in professional development offered by the school.  In 
addition, many staff members participate in additional trainings 
appropriate for individual needs or for specific programs sponsored by the district through departments.  Site professional d
evelopment is held during 
early release and grade level/subject co
llaboration days.  These collaborations focus on content standards by grade level and provide teachers time to  
plan for first best instruction. Grade level release time (Tuesday early release, P.E./prep) affords opportunities to discuss
 
student results on
 
formative 
and summative assessments.  District professional development includes release days and after school workshops.  When appropr
iate to meet the needs 
of students, staff attends conferences. Site academic coaches support certificated and paraprofes
sional staff by providing workshop opportunities, 
individual mentoring, and in
-
class coaching.  New teachers are supported by the Teacher Induction Program that includes coaching and mentoring.  
Classified paraprofessionals and support staff attend job
-
rel
ated training provided by the site and district.
