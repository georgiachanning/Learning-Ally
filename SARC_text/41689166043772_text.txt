School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

structure is designated for the Kindergarten classes and is connected to two of the kinder classrooms. New structures on 
both yards were install
ed in 2018.
 
 
Every year the school district makes any needed repairs to maintain a safe facility. The site is cleaned daily and maintained
 
by District custodians and grounds keepers. Over the next five years, the school site will be modernized. A list of p

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Daniel Webster is committed to maintaining a safe environment for student, staff and volunteers. We conduct monthly 
fire drills, quarterly earthquake drills and lock down drills. All emergency procedures are clearly stated in our Safety Plan
, 
which is upda
ted and reviewed annually. A copy of the Safety Plan is available upon request.
 
 
We believe that consistent, clearly communicated expectations are essential to providing a safe, positive learning 
environment for all students. Students and parents are infor
med about school discipline policies and procedures at the 
beginning of the school year through a student handbook. In addition, a rules assembly is conducted a the beginning of 
the school year to review acceptable behaviors at school. Positive Based Schoo
l Wide Discipline (PBIS) is implemented 
school
-
wide which ensures that every student knows the appropriate behavior for every setting in the school (classroom, 
hallways, cafeteria...)

Monthly assemblies are held to review designated areas and every student
 
is rotated through each area to practice 
expected behaviors. Students are acknowledge with "Leopard Loot" when caught behaving to reinforce positive habits. 
Weekly drawings are made in the classroom and school
-
wide.
 
 
Every classroom participates in Soul S
hoppe on a monthly basis. During these workshops, students are given various tools 
for resolving conflicts and learn how to treat one another with respect. Soul Shoppe also trains a "Peacemakers" to help 
students resolve their conflicts. Peacemakers are on
 
the yard and available to help students every day during morning 
recess, lunch and afternoon recess. In addition to Peacemakers, we provide adult supervision before school, after school 
and during all breaks. The administrator, three physical education ai
des and parent volunteers monitor the yards as well 
as assist with
 
curbside pick
-
up. This year we began a partnership with Playworks. Junior Coaches on also on the yard during all recess. 
Two Junior Coaches are assigned to a game (4
-
square, dodgeball...) t
o encourage students to engage in play, teach the 
rules and resolve conflicts.
 
 
All visitors are required to register at the office and wear a guest pass before being allowed on campus. Daniel Webster is 
piloting a new program called Rapture, which 
runs a basic back ground check on visitors via their licenses as an extra layer 
of security.

Daniel Webster provides all English learners with English Language Development five days a week, for 45 minutes. 
Students are placed into Targeted Instructional Groups (TIG) based on 
their ELCAP scores. Site funds are used to pay for a 
.5FTE English Language teacher to decrease class size for Els during TIG. District adopted materials are used for the 
instructional block and taught by credentialed teachers.
 
 
Every student at Daniel Web
ster receives "Universal Access" Monday thru Friday for 30 minutes. During this time, students 
receive instruction at their given levels. Students who are considered high risk (reading two or more years below grade 
level) are identified via our MTSS proces
s and assigned a reading intervention tutor. Our tutors use a research based 
intervention program and work with no more than three students at a time. We also offer small group homework support, 
reading intervention and math intervention classes after scho
ol for students who need additional support.
