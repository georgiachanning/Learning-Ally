School Description
 
Welcome to La Pluma Elementary School where our mission is developing students to lead, think, 
problem
-
solve, care, and create!  With approximately 400 students, our school encourages children 
to develop a love for learning in a safe, engaging, and academi
cally challenging environment.  
Students, parents, and staff team together to provide a positive campus where we shape academic, 
physical, emotional, social and artistic development of our students.  Our staff and students are 
focused on our BIG 3; Be Safe
, Be Respectful, and Be Responsible.
 
 
Our Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports have been honored by the state of California with a recent PBIS award 
for our effort to improve the social and emotional well
-
being of our students.
 
 
We partner closely 
with families and our surrounding community to create a supportive environment that recognizes 
the individual differences and needs of our children.  We work to support one child at a time as we 
help students grow and develop with 21st century skills.  Pre
paring your child for the future is our 
primary goal and we welcome you as our partners in this important journey.
 
 
 
 
The elementary years are the foundation for development of strong positive attitudes and 
academic skills.  With this responsibility in min
d, our curriculum is rigorous, motivating, and 
creative.   Learning is challenged and supported through standards
-
based instruction, unified units 
of study, small group and whole group learning, technology, problem solving, inquiry, and 
enrichment opportun
ities such as art, music, and drama.
 
 
In addition, we understand the 
importance of communication as a 21st Century skill.
 
 
Our school is an AVID certified elementary 
campus, promoting collaborative structures as well as students engaged in debate and acade
mic 
conversations.
 
 
Our classroom learning environments promote intellectual curiosity, encourage 
creativity, and provide a balance between teamwork and independence.
 
 
 
 
As part of our commitment to the community, parent involvement at La Pluma continues to soar! 
On any given day, visitors to our campus will see parents working together with teachers in 
classrooms, on the playground, and in our parent center, providing tha
t key ingredient found in 
highly effective schools. At La Pluma, we share a unified vision to increase student achievement, 
address the needs of the whole child through the arts and character education, and to cultivate 
responsible, respectful, and product
ive citizens.

About th
e SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Loca
l Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to 
address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional informatio
n about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

La Pluma stands with a committed and active PTA.  Our PTA prides itself on strengthening the school by providing many program

opportunities for our students and families.  Parents in our school are enc
ouraged to volunteer in various capacities, including classroom helpers, library 
volunteers, mentors, field trip chaperones, office projects, room parents, playground helpers, G.A.T.E. program enrichment, a
nd, of course, involvement 
with our PTA. Many of o
ur parents are involved in our district PTA Council meetings and special events. In addition, parents play a key role on our 
School 
Site Council Committee. They are involved with our English Language Advisory Committee, and they serve as liaisons to severa
l district committees.  PTA 
leadership has always encouraged parents to be highly involved in their child's education.  Parents create wonderful partners
hips by sharing their time 
and talents.
 
 
Many special events are planned in partnership with our parent

success for all of our students!
 
 
 
 
We strive for a community
-
like atmosphere.  Frequent communication provides parents with many ways to get involved and gain knowledge about their 
child's education.  Each month, our PTA highlights key
 
events on campus through our social media posts on Facebook and Twitter.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Supervision staff and 
volunteers monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses and at lunch time. As
 
part 
of our Positive Behavior Support Program, teachers regularly review the rules for safe, responsible, and respectful behavior 
in school, on the playground, 
and about campus. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the school office and 
sign in, where they receive 
a visitor's badge to wear throughout their stay.
 
 
We revise our School Sa
fety Plan annually in February. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency suppl
ies. 
We share the plan with all staff during a school wide staff meeting. We practice fire and earthquake drills ten times a year 
a
nd hold mock trainings for 
staff and students on emergency preparedness in October and late April.  We have an earthquake shed where we store emergency 
supplies for every 
student and faculty member as well as the parent and community volunteers who can be 
found at La Pluma on any given day.
