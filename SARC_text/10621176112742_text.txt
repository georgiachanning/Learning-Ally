About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 1995, Maple Creek is 23 years old. We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our custodians perform basic clean
ing operations daily and 
maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, de
ep cleaning is conducted two times a year. Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus 
inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feed
back to our student body. 
When asked to g



-
campus policy, 
we hope to keep vandalism 
and burglary to an alltime low.
 
 
With the use of 20 classrooms, we comfortably house and provide instruction for our 640 students. Two additional classrooms a
re used for music and 
resource specialist services and one special day c
lassroom. As an extension of the classroom, the Maple Creek media center operates as a library and 
research center of the school. Through cooperative planning and teaching, the library media center is a focus for teachers an
d students to become 
information
 
literate, lifelong learners and informed decision makers. The district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. A
s a result, a high 
priority is placed on building and maintaining excellent facilities as economically as possible.
 
 
In June 2012,
 
voters within the CUSD approved Measure A, a $298 million bond. The bond was designed to maintain good neighborhood schools a
nd 
retain and attract quality teachers by upgrading classrooms, science labs, vocational education opportunities, fire
-
safety syst
ems and libraries; ensuring 
accessibility for disabled individuals; and acquiring sites, constructing and equipping school facilities. In March 2015, con
struction began on several of 
our buildings, adding a conference room, expanding our technology classro
om and library media center. Additionally, several improvements were made 
across our campus.
 
 
Maple Creek has installed a camera monitoring system; several cameras are strategically placed to assist in promoting a safe 
school environment.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and gr
ade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive
 
disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

lopment buyback days, and regularly throughout the year. Our previously updated plan was presented 
and approved in December 2018. Key elements of the plan include monthly safety drills practiced with students to ensure they 
have an understanding 
of all eme
rgency procedures. These include lockdown, school alert, evacuation, fire drill, power outage and earthquake.
 
 
Throughout each year, we review safety procedures with staff and run drills with our students. We welcome parent input during
 
SART meetings. We 
w
ork with Fresno Police Department traffic division as well as CUSD police for additional support during our drop off and pick
 
up.
 
 
Each room on our campus has a folder with our school safety plan. Each teacher has a black emergency whistle, an emergency fl
ip chart and a walkie
-
talkie for communication. We use several methods of media for communication with our staff including text messages, emails, t
elephones and walkie

Annually, an effective process for staff development is planned and implemented to support staff in their professional growth
. Staff development in
-
services are scheduled prior to the beginning of the school year as well as throughout the year based on inp
ut gathered from the staff. Maple Creek staff 
constantly seeks to improve its teaching practices and strategies, as well as its use of technology through release time for 
a variety of trainings, grade
-
level meetings and in
-
service experiences. Early studen
t dismissal on Wednesdays provides teachers an additional 90 minutes weekly to collaborate and 
articulate within their grade
-
level professional learning teams and across grade levels.
 
 
Throughout the year, we use our faculty meeting days and Wednesday earl
y release days for professional development. Our goal with professional 
development is to improve instructional practices to help all students reach and maintain academic proficiency. Over the past
 
few years, professional 
development has concentrated on th
e development of a Mastery Learning model, professional learning communities, Kagan strategies, Growth Mindset, 
Cultural proficiency, innovative instruction through technology, reading comprehension and writing instruction, best instruct
ional practices, an
d use of 
technology and data to inform instruction. Our teachers at Maple Creek are role models of lifelong learning. Many of our vete
ran teachers have their 

-
development seminars off
ered in and out of the district, particularly those 
aligned with our goal of all students meeting and maintaining academic proficiency. Upon attendance and completion of profess
ional development, all 
teachers are strongly encouraged to share their knowledg
e of new practices with all staff.
 
 
In 2018
-
19, we will continue to work toward deeper implementation of our professional learning teams. Our professional learning teams
 
(grade
-
level 
teams) will continue to center conversations on data. Our grade
-
level tea
ms regularly review both formative and summative assessment data to identify 
areas of strength and weakness. After reviewing data, they develop instructional goals and adjust their instruction. We have 
an identified MTSS (multi
-
tiered support system) in pl
ace to support all students to academic success. Our intervention is targeted and progress monitored every two weeks. Our 
focus on Writing and Close reading continue this year.
 
 
Teachers are supported in several ways, for example: administrative participat
ion in professional learning teams; teacher data meetings; informal walk
-
through with coaching; and by conversations on data, best instructional practices and research.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified ne
eds:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In t
he 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five profes
sional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout th
e school year.
 
One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
base
d training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated 
Application and Reporting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which contains program
 
and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains th
e budget information and additional program data, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Title I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant

students in
 
mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community.  CU
SD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the child

education will not only bring success to your child but other children in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in
 
the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud
 
to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending on the type of categorica
l 
funding a site may receive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and gui
del
ines.  Such advisory 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) describes the school

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every student.  Parental involvement is a nece
ssary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall p

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP).  If you would like additional information on any of the District Parent Councils or Commi
ttees, please ca

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical
 
programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing an
d evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves
 
as an 
advisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs
 
are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to functio
n as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T
he ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes 
recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding services for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the dis
trict, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra
nge to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaw
s require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) e
lected to serve as the DELAC 

s ELAC.
 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achieveme
nt of our students, community agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades
 
K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state 
performance standards expected of all students in grades pre
-
K 
-

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP annually that works to better align the academic plan
 
with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CU
SD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, D
istrict Meetings and 
Community
 
Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share their idea
s on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in th


 
 

uth and families and to 
provide input a
nd feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to share new ideas to
 
support 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical fun

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

haracteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they h
ave a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental ser
vices and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Categorical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high 
quality learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any lear
ning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff de
velopment 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff
 
to challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
