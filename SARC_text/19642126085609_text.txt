About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California 
is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencie
s (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reporte
d in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac
/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members sh
ould contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction with the focus on student l
earning.  Staff development 
is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel. Staff members work collaboratively to determine
 
the school's needs and take direction from 
District and State requirements when establishing professional development goals for the school year.  School wide training f
ocus areas include 
technology, differentiation, and using data to drive instruction.  A
dditionally, staff receive both district and site based training in math and language arts. 
There is a deliberate effort to connect all training and development to the implementation of the state standards. Staff memb
ers build teaching skills 
and concepts 
by participating in many conferences and workshops throughout the year and by sharing their experiences and knowledge with co
lleagues 
during designated collaboration sessions.
