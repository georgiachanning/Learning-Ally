By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Durham Elementary is an exceptional place for learning where staff, parents, volunteers, and community members work 
together for academic excellence. Our 
Tiger pride abounds daily, as we foster a climate of awareness, acceptance, and 
inclusiveness, that allows all students to succeed. Our staff members embrace learning opportunities and have 
consistently aligned instruction and methods with state adopted cu
rriculum with a focus on Common Core standards. 
Durham's strength is in the commitment of home, school, and community, working towards the common goal of ensuring 
a nurturing educational experience for all! Teachers participate in weekly collaboration wher
e our focus is on data analysis 
from Common Core aligned Benchmark assessments and professional development.  Teachers examine test results and 
share instructional ideas in teams to come up with the best strategies to meet student needs. Durham is proud of
 
the 

Discovery group that aligns with their independent learning needs, participate in weekly Visual and Performing Arts 
lessons, taught 
by a credentialed teacher, and attend Physical Education with our full time PE teacher.  Art docents provide 
monthly standards
-
based art lessons for all students. We hold monthly Spirit Days planned by our Student Council, as well 
as provide opportunities 
for students to attend field trips that enrich their learning experience. Together, in partnership 

supports a growth mindset that focuses 
on the power of "yet",  so all students can learn in a respectful, responsible, and 
safe environment.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

Durham Elementary School is 
fortunate to have tremendous volunteer participation. On a daily basis we have many 
parents, retired teachers, and other community members partnering to support the educational programs within our 
classroom and across the school. We have a very active Pare
nt Teacher Student (PTS) organization who dedicate their 
time and talents throughout the school.  Our PTS sponsors activities including special assemblies, field trips, movie night, 
skate nights, Grandparents Day and many other special events. Additionally
, our parents sponsor an art docent program 
to bring the arts alive in the classroom. Parents have helped raise money to purchase playground structures for our 
students, technology, assemblies and various supplies for our school.  Parents can also be invol
ved in School Site Council, 
which meets on a regular basis to evaluate the school program and develops the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement. 
Our parents are also active in supporting the development of our district LCAP plan. For more information on how
 
to 
become involved at the school, please contact school secretary Yolanda Prentice or Principal Lisa Atlas at (530) 895

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Durham Elementary prides itself on having a clean, safe, and orderly campus.  All staff and students participate in monthly 
fire drills, as well as earthquake drills, lockdowns, and other safety drills as needed t
o ensure staff and students are 
informed and ready to respond to an emergency should it be necessary. These evacuation procedures are discussed at 
staff meetings with staff and within the classroom with students. The school utilizes Catapult Emergency Mana
gement 
System, an electronic program, as a means for communication and accountability during an emergency. The school safety 
plan is reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty at the beginning of each year.  All classrooms are equipped 
with an
 
emergency garbage can containing, water, space blankets, medical supplies, and information about each student 
in the class. Durham holds high expectations that all students will follow our school rules to promote a positive, safe schoo
l 
environment. Routi
nes and expectations for a safe and orderly campus are set early in the year and revisited as needed. 
Parents are informed that we ask that all visitors on campus check in the office first to receive a badge prior to going to 
classrooms or other areas on c
ampus.

wid

are held during collaboration time, staff meetings, and minimum days during the school year.  We are in our third year of 
implementing AVID Elementary.  As a staff we meet monthly to engage in conversation and share best practices on our 
two ide
ntified focus areas, note taking and organization.  Our areas of focus continue to be implementation of Common 
Core State Standards in the areas of math, English language arts, Next Generation Science Standards and integrating the 
standards for English lan
guage development into all of these curricular areas. Staff members also attended conferences 
and training in the areas of reading interventions, PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports), English language 
learners, technology, science, literacy, 
and working with students with special needs. Teachers continually analyze student 
data and plan instruction and interventions. The site principal conducts weekly walk through to observe instruction and 
provide feedback to teachers.
 
 
Teachers are supported 
in grade
-
level teams as a whole staff and through meetings with the principal. Before and after 
school professional development is offered to any teachers by the site administrator.
