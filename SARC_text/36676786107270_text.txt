About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been pr
ovided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners, that ar
e 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in the foll
owing subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or instructiona
l materials were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes off
ered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided for eac
h student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school 
year. A
dditionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing arts.*
Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California State Bo
ard of Education approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list to con
sider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria,
 
entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisor
s and teachers monitor students to ensure students interact safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a re
gular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addit
ion to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out during breaks and vacation periods. The school facilit
y is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playground, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A planned or recently c
o
mpleted school improvement 
for this site is a full school modernization project currently in progress and a schoolwide security camera and keyless acces
s system in progress.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations depart
ment staff conduct inspections at the school sites on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Main
tenance staff works diligently to complete all work orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to recor
d inspection results. 

and there were no deficiencies 
observed during this inspection.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools. We expect parents to be partners with us 
in school wide activities 
and programs. Parents are encourage


-
making group, or simply attending school 
events. 
The Oak Ridge PTA has an incredibly involved and active membership who volunteers thousands of dollars and hours each year in
 
such educational 
programs as the school wide Art Appreciation Program (Picture person), parent support groups, spirit acti
vities, academic and behavior incentives, 
playground equipment, technology, field trips, and much more invaluable support and resources.
 
 
Oak Ridge has an active School Site council, which meets four times a year to assess school needs, develop budgets, an
d implement strategies to enhance 
academic success.
 
 
Parents and guardians stay informed on upcoming events and school activities through teacher communication, classroom web pag
es, weekly phone 
messages, email and text announcements, and the school web pa
ge. Parents are encouraged to consider the multiple opportunities to volunteer at Oak 
Ridge. Some possibilities are classroom helpers, student small group support, PTA Art Prep, Room Parent, and school wide acti
vities (i.e. ProDad, 
Father/Daughter Dance, M
other/Son activity night, Family Fun Night, fundraising activities, Spirit Day Activities, Yearbook, etc.)
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion 
rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.

School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed 
School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the School Site Council. The dat

on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are reviewed monthly by the Sch
ool 
Site Council.  Each 

onents and procedures. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular basis so that all students a
nd staff are familiar with emergency procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy regarding campus visitors
 
is e
nforced by requiring

The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health an
d safety, in both form and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan as a
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the 
overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect all students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency mana
gement, and public health 
officials as re
quired by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
ritical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these d
rills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster P
reparedness Plan establishes the minimum requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management Syst
em (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
24
50, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
