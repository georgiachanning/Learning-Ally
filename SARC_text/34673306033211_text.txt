School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
Peter J. Shields Elementary
 
School will create students who are inspired, compassionate, and creative individuals who are 
empowered to excel beyond their own expectations. Staff, students, and parents will collaborate to provide a safe, healthy 
learning environment where students ha
ve the confidence to take academic and social risks. The high expectations we 
have for our students will prepare them for their educational future. As positive role models, it is our mission to develop 
proficient learners that have the skills they need to 
navigate through a complex world.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Peter J. Shields (PJS) is located in a neighborhood of long
-
time residents and younger families moving into affordable 
homes. The school has been in existence since the early 1960's and has bee
n the proud institution to house several 
generations of families. Our population draws from both apartment complexes and single
-
family homes. Our ethnic make
-
up enjoys diversity with a variety of languages including Spanish, Armenian, Russian and Ukrainian
 
in addition to English. 
Because of our diversity, Peter J. Shields Elementary qualifies for two bilingual instructional aides who assist us with 
language and content acquisition for our English Learner students. We are a school that qualifies for Title I 
funding based 
on the level of poverty that exists in our student population. Title I funds afford us the ability to hire a reading speciali
st, 
provide supplementary classroom materials, purchase release time for teachers for planning and collaboration and 
attend 
professional development opportunities. Our school offers students two after
-
school child care/enrichment options; the 
After School Education and Safety (ASES) program which is a free, grant
-
based after school care and the Student Care 
program which
 
is parent
-
paid. Both programs offer time for homework and snacks. In coordination with both programs 
that we are able to offer math and reading intervention classes while students are still on campus in addition to extended 
day support instruction. Our sc
hool enjoys great parent participation at our event nights such as our Harvest Festival, 
movie nights, Open House, Family Welcome/Meet the Teacher, and Back to School Night. Our Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA) has a small but creative and active group of 
parents that add to the richness of the PJS experience.
 
 
As soon as you walk onto the Peter J. Shields campus, you can feel the inclusiveness of the staff and parent community. 
Students greet all teachers warmly and all of the staff adds to the welcoming a
tmosphere and positive culture of Peter J. 
Shields.

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equip
ment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and
 
to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed b
y all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays in
formation about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our custodial and district staff maintains our school and grounds, so that it is clean and beautiful. Trash is routinely pick
ed 
up and the buildings are kept free of graffiti. We have  benches for parents and students arou
nd the campus and shaded 
picnic tables bordering our playing fields. The facilities are checked each morning and evening by custodial staff for 
vandalism, cleanliness and safety.
 
 
Peter J. Shields was remodeled during the summer of 2001. At that time, new 
bells and alarms were installed school wide, 
as well as improved handicap access to restrooms and drinking fountains. All classrooms are equipped with energy 
efficient heating and air conditioning units. Phones are in all classrooms, allowing teachers and 
students access to direct 
outside lines. The school received a new infrastructure to support computers and Internet accessibility throughout the 
campus.
 
 
We are very proud of our school as it is a beautiful, welcoming and well
-
kept campus!

ool event before school begins, Back to School Night, Open House, Fall Harvest 
Festival, Family Movie Nights, Milk and Cookies, morning coffee, book fairs, the school end of year picnic and parent

membership has increased each year. PTA is improving the quality of instruction by providing funds for field trips, 
classroom materials, and other instructional and social activities.
 
Parents are welcome and invited to volunteer in the 
children's classrooms for special events, chaperones on field trips, and in the school library.
