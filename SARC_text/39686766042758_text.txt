Roosevelt Elementary School
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
To provide a learning environment that promotes college and career readiness for all students 
while building relationships with the community.
 
 
Vision Statement:
 
Our vision is to create a high performing Pre
-
K through 8th grade school th
at promotes our students 
to become lifelong learners who contribute to their society.
 
 
School Description:
 
Roosevelt Elementary School is one of the oldest schools in the city of Stockton. The school was 
constructed in 1921 and opened for its students in t
he fall of 1923. Roosevelt has continued with 
its diverse population of English language learners, migrant families, students with special needs, 
and long time established community.
 
 
Roosevelt is proud of its diverse population with approximately 463 stud
ents which includes 8% 
African American, 1% American Indian, 4% Asian, 79% Hispanic,  and 5.3% White students. In 17/18 
school year, we Reclassified Fluent English Proficient 15%.
 
 
The culture of Roosevelt Elementary is clearly established as a professiona
l learning community 
(PLC). Our staff assists students in making responsible choices to maximize the possibilities for their 
futures. We are solution
-
oriented to the struggles that some students must overcome. We maintain 
high expectations for student perf
ormance. Students are encouraged to be creative, insightful, 
remain on task and put their best work effort forward.
 
 
School personnel act as advocates for the students. Students in need of additional support are 
identified through data analysis.Needs are a
ddressed through Response to Intervention (RTI), a 
tiered structure of support. Support may include strategic planning, after
-
school tutorials, Student 
Assistance Program (SAP), Student Success Team (SST),counseling, partnerships with outside 
agencies, and
 
special education. Roosevelt staff is working to bring English language learners to full 
functioning fluency and literacy, necessary for career and continuing educational opportunities. 
The staff guides students as they gain confidence and skills through 
self
-
actualization; encouraging 
students toward ever
-
increasing goals, and respecting the promise of who they are.
 
 
As principal of Roosevelt Elementary School, I believe that all kids can learn regardless of zip code 
or label, every single student who wal
ks into a school is capable of learning. We must be cognizant 
of the fact that each child is unique and as such he or she learns differently. For this fact alone, we 
must be open to differentiated and personalized pedagogical strategies. All kids have grea
tness 
hidden inside them. It is the job of an educator to help them find and unleash it.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional 
Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether those books are what the California c
ontent standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the textbooks used 
in our core classes a
nd their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Imp
rovements (Most Recent Year)
 
Each school site has classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. The number of classrooms at e
ach school site varies, 
depending on enrollment and available space. Several sites have portable class
 
rooms to accommodate increased enrollment and to meet the guidelines 
for Class Size Reduction (CSR).
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in
 
a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classroo
ms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are c
lean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available upon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
