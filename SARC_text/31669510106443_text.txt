School Description
 
Twelve Bridges Elementary School (TBES) is a California Gold Ribbon School where students and 
parents are valued and treated with respect.  Our ultimate goal is to collaboratively create an 
educational atmosphere that is safe and enriching for all students
.  The school is located in the 
Western Placer Unified School District in the community of Twelve Bridges and the city of Lincoln.  
The school serves transitional kindergarten through fifth grade with a current enrollment of 
approximately 650 students.  Ou

learners by providing a comprehensive education for every student which fosters high academic 
achievement, positive self
-
worth, and responsible citizenship in an environment of mutual respect, 

 
 
Built in 2004, Twelve Bridges Elementary was designed to incorporate a strong emphasis of outdoor 

 
which includes: a solar
-
powered drinking fountain, giant sundial, herb garden, and bird feeders.  In 
grade level clusters, each class had a class garden to grow vegetables, fruit, or flowers.  There is 
also a school orchard and greenhouse.  The landscape 
is attractive and aesthetically pleasing with 
a five acre Twelve Bridges Park adjacent to the playground.
 
 
The campus is comprised of:
 
34 classrooms (includes 2 science, 2 music,  2 kinder, 3 Special Day Classes, 1 Resource Specialist, 1 
Speech Pathologist
, 1 School Psychologist, and Intervention); Library; Technology Lab; 
Multipurpose Room; Kitchen; Art Room; and Administration Building (Principal, Assistant Principal, 
Secretary, Clerk).
 
 
Twelve Bridges Elementary students are viewed as future leaders.  Ou
r goal is to create well
-
rounded students who are empowered to bring about positive change in our world.  We have a 

school
-
wide expectations: Responsibility , 
Offer Kindness, Always Be Safe, and Resolve Problems.  

entire staff has been trained in Love & Logic and and Youth Development Institute.We have also 
establish
ed a K
-
Kids Service Club sponsored by Kiwanis International.  Together with our Tiger Crew 
leadership program, these two groups help give our kids the opportunity to learn and practice 
service and leadership.
 
 
The collaborative culture at the site fosters 
purposeful communication and informed decision 
making.  On a weekly basis, teachers participate in grade level Professional Learning Communities 
(PLC) as a school site.  We have established a Leadership team comprised of the school principal, 
psychologist,
 
and teacher representation from all grade
-
levels for shared decision making on our 
direction as a site.  We also have a data team whose purpose is to meet twice a month to analyze 
data (both behavior and academic) to help guide our instruction and interve
ntion practices.  We 
utilize the i
-
Ready program to help us gather academic performance data on all of our students so 
we can appropriately address the individual learning needs of all of our students.  We utilize our 
"Tiger Time" intervention/enrichment b
lock to enable us group students accordingly.  Our PBIS 
Team meets monthly to look at behavior data and address areas of concern as well as ways to 
continue promoting an overall positive school climate.  Many of our staff are also YDI (Youth 
Development In
stitute) trained to work on ways to continue establishing positive, productive 
relationships with students and other staff members.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Ca
rd (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability P
lan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
Fo
r more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCF
F web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement at TBE is the cornerstone of the school and parents are
 
viewed as partners in the education of students.  Parents are actively involved 
as volunteers in the classroom and participate on various committees.  Our parents assist in a variety of capacities, which i
ncludes: learning centers, 
reading groups, math gr
oups, field trip chaperones, Garden Docents, Art Docents, and PE Docents.  Parents bring with them a broad background of 
expertise and experience, which enhances the learning experience for students.  In addition to parents, there is a large grou
p of Sun C
ity Volunteers who 
also participate in similar roles.
 
 
The Parent Teacher Club (PTC) is very active supporting school
-
wide events and enrichment programs through well planned fundraisers.  The PTC 
organizes family events such as: Restaurant Nights, Harvest
 
Festival, Bingo Nights, the Fun Run, Family Painting Nights, Family Dance Nights, and more.  
The Harvest Festival, Fun Run, and Bingo Nights are the main fundraisers for the year.  With the ongoing dedication of the PT
C and funds raised, our 
school is abl
e to host purposeful assemblies; purchase playground equipment, art supplies, and classroom supplies; provide paper and ink f
or classrooms; 
beautify the school; and purchase technology.
 
 
Our PTC also serves as our School Site Council (SSC).  Documents such
 
as the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, School Safety Plan, and School 
Accountability Report Card are reviewed and updated.  The SSC also monitors progress on school
-
wide goals and site budget allocations.
 
 
TBE depends on parent and community voluntee
rs to enhance and enrich the learning environment for all students.  Teachers and staff continue to be 
grateful for their on
-
going participation and dedication.

plan includes procedures for 
emergencies.  We practice fire drills monthly, and have four other drills (lock
-
down, lock
-
out, shelte
r, and a school
-
wide evacuation drill) practiced during 
the year.
 
 
Staff members monitor our playground and campus before school, during recesses, during lunch, and after school.  Close superv
ision is employed to 
create positive interaction with students a
nd to proactively stop any unsafe behavior or interactions.  Staff members on duty wear an orange/pink/yellow 
safety vest and carry a radio for quick accessibility or locating, if needed.
 
 
The perimeter of campus is fenced, including an interior gate which
 
forces visitors to check into the office prior to accessing the campus as a whole.  
Gates are locked during the school day with the exception of the main, front gate.  Classrooms are locked during the school d
ay with the exception of 
occasional activities
 
or situations that require the door to be propped open.  Visitors enter through the main gate, sign in at the office, and wea
r a visitor 
lanyard.  Volunteers working in classrooms or chaperoning field trips must have a TB and fingerprint clearance.  We ha
ve also installed numerous 
surveillance cameras focused on our blacktop and all of our school entrance/exit points.
 
 
We have created comprehensive classroom emergency kits in the event of an emergency or prolonged lock
-
down.  All classrooms have a Barracud
a 
Intruder Defense System which will securely lock the door in a lock
-
down situation.

Number of school days 
dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The collaborative culture at the site fosters purposeful communication and informed decision making.  On a weekly basis, teac
hers participate in grade 
level Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC) as a school site.  In addition, Western Placer Unified School District generally provides three Staff 
Development Days each year to all teachers who want to take the time to collaborate with site and/or cross
-
site PLC teams to continue cu
rriculum 
development.   We have an established an Leadership team comprised of the school principal, psychologist, and teacher represe
ntation from all grade
-
levels for shared decision making on our academic direction as a site.  Two of our grade levels are
 
receiving ongoing training with a consultant to align 
our current curriculum with the California Math Framework.  Our PBIS Team has also completed our Tier III training with count
y coaches and meets 
monthly on site to look at behavior data and address are
as of concern as well as ways to continue promoting an overall positive school climate.  Many 
of our staff went through YDI (Youth Development Institute) training the past three summers to work on ways to continue estab
lishing positive, 
productive relation
ships with students and other staff members.   In addition to these established programs, other professional development 
opportunities that staff have taken advantage of include TESS instructional training, a GLAD refresher course, NGSS (Next Gen
eration Sc
ience Standards) 
implementation training, ERWW (Expository Reading & Writing Workshop), and other more individual opportunities that teachers 
want to participate in.  
Five of our teachers attended a multi
-
day "Get Your Teach On" conference over the past tw
o summers to increase engagement and rigor in the classroom.  
Those teachers have since shared their experiences at staff meetings and created a "Rock Your School" day focused on engaging
 
activities earlier this 
year.
