School Description
 
Sanchez Elementary School is located in
 
the city of Rosemead. Sanchez serves about 465 students 
from Kindergarten through sixth grade. Our students represent a diverse population with English, 
Hispanic, Chinese and Vietnamese cultures as our primary ethnic groups. We have an almost 60/40 
ratio 
of Asian and Hispanic immigrant population with 49% of our students are designated English 
Language Learners. Of our population 90.95% are receiving Free or reduced Lunch.  In previous 
years Sanchez was recognized by the state as a Title I Academic Achieve
ment School.
 
 

addition we are proud to be a Positive Behavior and Intervention Support School. In addition, we 
are an AVID and Code to the Future School. The
 
learning environment of the school reflects a 
balance between high academic standards and personal social
-
emotional growth.  Students who 
develop a positive self
-
image tend to perform better academically and socially.
 
 
The staff at George I. Sanchez Eleme
ntary is committed to collaboration with students, families and 
the community at large in promoting educational excellence within positive paradigms of potential, 
change and motivation in order to provide high quality, research based instruction which will
 
equip 
our students to become reflective, curious lifelong learners and successful leaders of our 21st 
century global community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Ca
rd (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability P
lan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
Fo
r more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCF
F web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

about themes and topics that mirror classroom teachings as well  as that which pertains to the academic and social emotional 
growth of their children. 
Parents are also a part o

Assignment, Technology Coach or ELD Intervention Teacher are also invited to attend at any given month. In addition, we are p
roud to pres
ent a 
partnership with Abriendo Puertas as they will present a 10 week institute on parent literacy and involvement in the academic
 
career of their child. Lastly, 
Sanchez has a wonderful community partnerships with the Reading is Fundamental program which 
invites parents and community to support 3 school 
wide events that build love of reading and literacy in all classrooms.
 
 
In terms of growing our parent leadership parents participate on the School Site Council (SSC), School Advisory Committee (SA

evacuation drills, lockdown 
drills, and general disaster drills  and helps us to b
etter prepare our students and staff for emergencies. Lastly, visitors to the Sanchez campus check in at 
the school office and receive an identification tag to be worn while at the site. All district employees wear personal name t

-
wide positive
 
reinforcement discipline plan and staff and students are currently being trained in Positive Behavior Intervention Support (P
BIS). An office discipline 
referral (ODR) is used to report behaviors that need to be addressed in order for students to grow acad
emically. All ODRs are inputted into our SWIS
