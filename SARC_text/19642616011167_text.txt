By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Highland Oaks School was built in 1949 and is a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. All schools in 
the Arcadia Unified School District underwent complete renovation in 1995

1996. In 2006

2007 Highl
and Oaks had the 
roof repaired, the sound system in the multipurpose room upgraded, and the faculty lounge renovated. As a result of 
Measure I passing by a strong local voter response in November 2006, Highland Oaks School was one of the first schools 
in t
he Arcadia Unified School District to undergo major renovations beginning in the winter of 2008. The renovations 
included a spacious new state
-
of the
-
art library and media center, cutting
-
edge technology in each classroom to enhance 
interactive instruction
 
and learning, a new enlarged covered outdoor lunch pavilion, new restrooms, and a new student 
services building as well as new flooring in every classroom and new double
-
paned window systems for most classrooms. 
The multipurpose room has new flooring, res
trooms, and new stage drapes. Most renovation projects, including 
landscaping and a new drainage system serving the entire site, were completed by August 2011. In 2018, the asphalt was 
re
-
done and new game lines were striped.
 
 
The Operations Supervisor, in cooperation with the principal, works with the custodial staff of two to ensure a clean and 
safe school. District maintenance staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working 
order are comp
leted in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and gives high priority to 
emergency repairs.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety 
and Disaster Committee, which consists of classified staff, teachers, and the principal. The committee sets goals for the 
school to conti
nually improve in 3 areas: School Climate (Students, Parents, and Programs), Emergency Preparedness 
(Disasters and Crisis), and School Environment (Facilities and Campus). The plan addresses various safety issues, including 
creating procedures that detect 
and prevent bullying, ensuring appropriate campus supervision, maintaining disaster kits, 
and monitoring emergency procedures. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated each year and approved by the 
School Site Council and the Board of Education.  Th
e plan is reviewed with all staff members at the beginning of each 
school year. Safety drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held four times a
 
year, and intruder/lockdown drills are held at least once a yea
r. Staff members also receive disaster training on a regular 
basis.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers, administrators, and school proctors supervise students on campus before and after 
school, and during breaks and lunch. Highland Oaks Elementary School 
has a closed campus, and permission is always 

office and must wear the proper identification badge at all times.

Under the current Local Control Funding Formula, districts like Arcadia Unified School District, with low numbers of 
unduplicated students receive far less ongoing money to implement the California Academic Standards compared to 
neighboring districts with 

youth).  These high unduplicated count districts receive supplemental and concentration grant monies to purchase 
materials, hire consultants, and pay for hours 
of professional development for their instructional and student support 
staffs.
 
 
In the Fall of 2013, the Arcadia Unified School District negotiated an interest
-
based solution for California Academic 
Standards implementation with its bargaining units to ad
d three days to the school calendar for two years starting in the 
2014
-
15 school year. Negotiations produced an agreement to spread the three days of additional paid time over seven 
early release days with development time of 2.5 hours per day built into t
he schedule.  Since 2015, AUSD leadership has 
negotiated annual agreements with its bargaining units to continue the additional three days for professional 
development.
 
 

d the Collaboration Time Advisory 
Council (C
-
TAC) with the task of putting legs to the plan. C
-
TAC is a representative group made up of bargaining unit 
members and management team members who were charged with serving as an advisory committee to the Distri
ct in the 
implementation of the district
-
wide California Academic Standards Collaboration Time supporting TK
-
12 instructional 
programs both vertically and horizontally, as they made dramatic instructional and curricular shifts.
 
 
The commitment from both ou
r bargaining units and management was to build research
-
based professional development 
around small collaborative working groups. Each group would be designed intentionally to have a vertical alignment of 
teachers from TK
-
12 engaged in the work together.
 
 
In late Spring of 2014, the C
-
TAC committee reached out to all certificated staff to assist with generating ideas for the 
content of the Collaboration Days. The committee, after reviewing and discussing the many ideas that were submitted 
and looking at sur
vey data, generated a list of themes which became the foundation of the Collaboration Days and assisted 
in guiding the development of a Course Group Catalogue. The planning of the Collaboration Days was research based, 
focused on meaningful work, teacher c
hoice, flexibility, and ongoing commitment. The Professional Development was 
designed around teacher interests that included creating autonomous choice for teachers and support providers in 
relation to where they felt they could best contribute their train
ing, talents, interests, and education, by participating in 
Small Working Groups (SWaG) and engaging with other professionals to continue the real work of implementing the 
California Academic Standards.  C
-
TAC continues to act as the advisory body for the 
Collaboration Days, reviewing survey 
data and requests for course offerings, and considering suggestions for improvements to the program.

Each SWaG is led by a self
-
selected Facilitator from amongst the various stakeholder groups and has been charged with
 
collaborating both with colleagues at their own site and with fellow professionals from other district sites. Mentor

support Facilitators by providing support throughout implementation of this professional development. The crystal
-
clear 
goals of t
he Collaboration Days include producing a comprehensive and fully articulated Arcadia California Academic 
Standards Core Curriculum in English

curriculum and instructional shifts towar

Education from a Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 12 perspective. Data continues to be collected f
rom the SWaGs 
through group evaluations and is then disaggregated and shared through various modalities to each stakeholder group.
 
 
In recent years, additional professional development resources have been designated for Mathematics and English
-
Language cur
riculum development and 21st Century instructional skill development, including National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) conferences, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning, in support of California 
Academic Standards implementation, Illumin
ate data and assessment system, AVID, Advanced Placement, and Next 
Generation Science Standards. At the high school level, data indicated that a large segment of potentially college
-
bound 
students were not being provided access and opportunity to pursue ho
nors and college
-
level courses, as their high
-
achieving classmates were. Leadership worked with teachers to engage in professional development around the themes 
of Advanced Placement (AP) open access and equity for all students over the past two years. Pro
fessional Development 
resources have been designated to send teachers, counselors and leadership to the local and regional College Board/A.P. 
Forums. Continued professional development will be pursued at the national level.
 
 
Full 
implementation of the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program continues to be a focus of 
professional development dollars over the past seven years.
 
 
Individual school sites have been tasked with working with the Instructional Coaches to co
nduct professional development 
around the themes of the California Academic  Standards, including rigor, focus, coherence, instructional strategies, shifts 
in curriculum, pacing and instructional materials, writing instruction and problem
-
solving.  Arcadia
 
Instructional Coaches 
have become regional professional development leaders by presenting at conferences and through their instituting the 
San Gabriel Valley Instructional Coaches Consortium.
 
 
Staff development topics from  2012

2018 school years have inc
luded effective instruction and critical thinking, 
implementation of the electronic grade book, the California Academic Standards, identification, development and curation 
of online resources, pedagogical shifts, brain research and Universal Design for Lea
rning (UDL) and Innovative Instruction.
