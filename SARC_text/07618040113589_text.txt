Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Live Oak Elementary School 
-
 
home of the 
Golden Eagles! I want to extend our warmest 
greetings to you and your family. Although Live Oak is a large elementary school, we are a family. 
Our staff is highly qualified, skilled and committed to working collaboratively to promote high 
academic success.
 
We have active parent organizations that coordinate activities to bring our 
families and staff together, in addition to raising funds to support our instructional programs. It is 
our collective goal to create an enriching learning environment that engages
 
every student, and we 
are honored to work with students and families from Preschool through 5th Grade.
 
 
At Live Oak, we are proud to share that our test scores continue to rise. Our achievement level 
remains high, with 95% of our students going to college
. Our school facilities are beautiful and every 
classroom is equipped with cutting edge technology. We are committed to preparing all students 
for a world that not only requires global competency and high academic standards, and we are also 
committed to me
eting the social and emotional needs of our students.
 
 
It is an honor to work with the staff, students, families and community.
 
 
Carolyn Dobel, Principal

Mission Statement
 
The body of Live Oak 
Elementary School provides a safe, innovative environment for its diverse 
community. It speaks with a confident voice and has a nurturing heart that is happy and loves 
learning. It develops a mind that thinks creatively and critically through teaching stra
tegies that 
challenge all students. This enables the hands to grasp the tools to succeed in an evolving society 
which provides steady feet to balance academic and social responsibilities.
 
 
School Profile:
 
Live Oak Elementary opened in August 2007, the 
fourth developer school in the Windemere 
community in the Dougherty Valley of San Ramon. Live Oak opened with more than 775 students 
and currently serves 849 TK
-
5 students as well as three preschool classes, in this, our thirteenth 
school year.
 
 
The facili

are two main campus areas and a large playground and field, all of which are gated and locked 
during the school day.  Our school also has access to Tiffany Roberts Park f
or PE and other outdoor 
activities. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of technology integration.  Students are 
given many opportunities to work with technology in all classrooms, as well as access to our Eagle's 
Nest which is a combination maker
space/technology room available to all teachers and students.
 
 
In 2010 and 2014, Live Oak was recognized as a California Distinguished School.  In 2016, Live Oak 
was named a California Gold Ribbon school and also received state 
acknowledgement for being a

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). T
he SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), 
which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more infor
mation about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page a

https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a 
comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and in
structional strategies. 
In 2012
-

ed district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. This
 
organization is highly 
respected and has strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS and professional learning offerings.

These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work
 
and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cros
s
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In 
addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and year long and are focused on topics that run the gamut from 
Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as TVTI
P). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framewor
k 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and the
ir Work.
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster 
a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a w
hole is enhanced.
