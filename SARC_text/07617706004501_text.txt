School Description
 
At Sleepy Hollow Elementary School we work together in order to provide a safe and caring 
environment for all students. The culture of our school reflects a commitment towards high 
academic achievement for all.
 
 
We provide a variety of o
pportunities for students that create a positive learning environment and 
promotes student achievement. One such opportunity is our school
-
wide weekly assemblies. Each 
assembly is held to promote school cohesiveness, team effort, and friendship. During the
se 
assemblies, we sing our school spirit song, recognize special events, celebrate student 
achievements, and meet new people. In addition, behavioral expectations, school rules, and other 
important information are shared with the group.
 
 
We are very proud 
of the many hours parent and community members provide for us each month. 
Parents are encouraged and welcomed to participate in the education of their children by serving 
on school committees or as classroom volunteers. Through parent donations and the fun
ding from 
Education Foundation Orinda (EFO), enrichment opportunities are also provided for all students. 
These programs include weekly instruction in art, music, and physical education instructed by 
credentialed teachers. There is a library technician who
 
supports teachers and children during their 
weekly visits to the school library.
 
 
Our Character Development curriculum includes character education, focusing on the values of 
respect, responsibility, a positive attitude, honesty, empathy, and self
-
discipl
ine. Students benefit 
from instruction from trained parent volunteers and teachers using the District
-
adopted Think First, 
Second Step program, a nationally recognized character education program. During the 2019
-
20 
school year, Sleepy Hollow students at e
very grade level have participated in multiple class visits 
from Kidpower, an organization that focuses on helping students to use their power to stay safe, 
act wisely, and believe in themselves. Classroom teachers have also implemented components of 
the C
aring School Community program, which focuses on the benefits of creating a classroom 
community.
 
 
We believe that when staff and parents work together to provide a positive learning climate, the 
children we share will become empowered individuals who can a
pply what they learn to become 
the problem solvers of tomorrow.
 
 
School Vision Statement
 
Our school's vision is to inspire students who are capable of meeting any academic challenge with 
openness, enthusiasm, and a willingness to solve problems. Our school
 
community is committed to 
developing students who are resilient and equipped with the knowledge, skills, and character to 
become empathetic, visionary, and socially responsible contributing members of society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, 
every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
al
l local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities.
 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardia
ns and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Qualit
y, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Orinda Union School District (OUSD) convenes textbook committees to help in the selection process. The textbook committees co
nsist of teachers and 
administrators in th
e District. State
-
approved books are reviewed, piloted, and a selection is made based upon pre
-
determined criteria. The books go on 
public display for two weeks and are then presented to the Governing Board for adoption. The district has affirmed that clas
s sets or electronic versions 
of textbooks are available to all students, including English learners.
 
 
At the middle school level, class sets or electronic versions are also purchased to eliminate the need of students carrying h
eavy books. Books have been 
purchased for all core academic areas as well as visual and performing arts, and music, at all grade levels. Textbooks are Ca
lifornia Department of 
Education
-
approved and California Standards
-
based.
 
 
A public hearing is held each October and reports are ma
de quarterly to the Governing Board to meet all requirements according to the Williams 
Settlement Agreement.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts 
the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our school takes pride in the active parent involvement that is ever
-
present withi
n our school and district. In addition to achieving nearly 100% 
participation in our Parents Club, Sleepy Hollow School parents are involved in decision making through our School Site Coord
inating Council. Each year, 
this team develops and monitors the Com
prehensive School Site Plan written to target strategic instructional goals aimed at continuous improvement of 
the instructional program. Additionally, parents complete an annual Spring survey that supports our ability to monitor and ad
just the Site Plan, 
communication strategies, and program development and effectiveness at our school.
 
 
The success of our program depends on the collective commitment of our staff, students, parents, and volunteers. Parents and 
other community 
volunteers assist in our classr
ooms daily. On an annual basis, a cadre of parents is trained to help implement the Think First, Second Step program in 
classrooms. Some parents work directly with students and others support teachers in classroom activities. Parents can make do
nations thr
ough the 
Parent Club or directly to the school. However, parents are also involved in providing the community with events that are cre
ated solely for the purpose 
of having fun together with our children. Our annual Creepy Hollow is an example of such an ev
ent. Over the past six years, our parents have organized 
a rotation of volunteers for AM crossing guard duty to ensure the pedestrian safety of students who walk to school and this p
rogram will continue for 
this school year.
 
 
Parents who wish to serve a br
oader range of students may do so through the Educational Foundation of Orinda (EFO) that supports students in grades 
Kindergarten through high school. Sleepy Hollow parents also provide input into the Local Control Accountability Plan through
 
district sta
keholder 
meetings and parent school surveys.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety is a
 
top priority for our school community. We establish, teach, and reinforce safety procedures and provide careful supervision o
f play activities 
during recesses. Our school discipline policy is aligned with our instruction for character education. There is 
a school emergency plan, which is reviewed 
annually and can be viewed in the school office. Emergency procedures are also summarized in the parent handbook.
 
 
Our Parents' Club volunteer Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, Rob Schroeder, works with us to en
sure that the emergency supplies stored in our 
emergency container and in classrooms are up to date and easily accessible when needed. Sleepy Hollow has specific plans and 
procedures for natural 
disasters and emergency situations. Our monthly fire drills, 
as well as periodic evacuation, shelter in place, and secure campus drills, provide important 

upplies as needed.
