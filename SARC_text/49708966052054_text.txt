By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the preventative measures and repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and wo
rking order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs and safety are given the highest priority.   A specific maintenance worker is assigned to each site to 
help assure the school'
s needs are being met.
 
 
During the 2004
-
05 school year, local bond funds, Measure D, and state matching funds were used to modernize all schools 
with the exceptions of Austin Creek, which was constructed in 2000, and Village School. Village 
School's multi
-
use facility 
and playground area have been recently modernized, as well as recent replacement of carpeting, lighting, and various 
other updating.  All classrooms in the other five schools received new wall surfaces, paint, lighting, cabinetr
y, heating 
systems, upgraded electrical systems, window coverings, flooring, and marker boards. Each multi
-
use facility was also 
completely modernized. State of the art library media centers and kindergarten complexes were built, and the 
administrative win
g of each school was modernized to include small classrooms for special student programs, a staff room, 
office, and conference rooms.

During the summer of 2015, local bond funds, Measure F and local reserves were utilized for modernization of the 
Matanzas
 
campus.  Included were upgraded HVAC systems, energy efficient windows, a remodeled office complex, and 
play field improvements.  The RVCS
-
Matanzas campus received the new construction of several classrooms, including a 
shared music building.  In August 2
017 the Madrone and Binkley campuses opened up a new building with 6 classrooms 
and a music room.  A new play field, along with energy efficient windows and other improvements were made to the 
campuses.  In August of 2018 Village opened up with a major ren
ovation to the classrooms, new classroom buildings, a 
new play field and play structure, and landscaping improvements.  School security improvements have also been made at 
some of the schools, with the other schools to be completed in the next two years.  
All schools have now received air 
conditioning as of August 2018.  All other schools will receive improvements through this bond program over the next 
couple of years.  The Governing Board has identified the following as key goals for the Measure F program
. To ensure the 
schools offices are easily located but the public, to replace portable classrooms with modular and/or stick built permanent 
buildings, and to upgrade energy efficiency components such as HVAC, lighting, and window systems.
 
 
Cleaning standar
ds have been adopted for all schools in the district. On a regular basis, the Maintenance and Operations 
supervisor meets with the custodial staff and often visits sites to ensure the cleaning standards are being upheld. In 
addition, the principal communic
ates daily with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.  The district is 
proactive with maintenance needs and annually updates its deferred maintenance plan.   Work under this plan includes 
roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, elect
rical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Discipline Practices
 
 
The staff and community of Sequoia Elementary School value a school where every student is free to learn and play in an 
environment that is both physically and emotionally safe, supportive, comfortable, and free from outside
 
interference and 
harm. We emphasize the development of courtesy, self
-
responsibility, and self
-
esteem. The school community works to 
reinforce and model restorative practices. The school/district rules and discipline procedures are outlined for students 
a
nd their parents at the beginning of the year in the first day packets. 
 
 
The following strategies are used to both encourage and recognize cooperative and positive behavior both in the 
classroom and on the playground:

Professional development opportunities are directly correlated to district goals and the Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP). With a focus on High Quality Instruction (HQI), we provide teachers with three full
-
days of annual 
inservice, 
monthly "District Wednesday" workshops on topics of interest/need (8 total), approximately 20 district
-
sponsored after 
school trainings annually, and 2
-
3 planning days throughout the year. A critical component of our professional 
development pla
n is coaching and mentoring through our Consulting Teacher program.  In addition, professional 
development opportunities are offered through attendance at Sonoma County Office of Education classes and educational 
conferences. For 2017
-

us are English Language Development, Technology Skills, Common Core ELA 
and Math standards implementation, and an incremental roll out of the Next Generation Science Standards.

Austin Creek and Rincon Valley has been focused on improving our math scores for students in grades 3

by the SBAC, and improving English language acquisition for our English learner students as determ
ined by our re

designation rates on the former CELDT and current ELPAC tests.
 
 
We use both district benchmark data and summative state
-
wide data to monitor our progress towards these goals.  For 
example, when reviewing on
-
going academic growth for our 
English learners we use the RenLearn STAR Reader 
assessment 3 times per year to gauge student progress to make just in time instructional decisions to support students 
not meeting grade level expectations, and we analyze data from the ELPAC and the SBAC to
 
review the effectiveness of 

math progress by reviewing Eureka Math end

During the 2017
-
18 school year the district adm
inistration and school site principals participated in professional 
development through the Center for Education Leadership (CEL).  A CEL trainer led several workshop sessions with the 
administration team where the focus was on the 5 Dimensions of Teaching
 
and Leadership.  The administration team 
observed in classrooms as part of the training and collaborated together on what high quality instruction is and how to 
look for this in our classrooms.  For the 2018
-
19 school year we expanded this professional de
velopment to include two 
teachers from each school site, and in addition to this the administration team is continuing to receive further professional
 
development in the framework through CEL.
