By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are encouraged to attend all parent meetings and workshops and to volunteer in their child's classroom. We 
provide parents with a volunteer training workshop to help them work collaboratively with teachers and provide 
meaningful support for our stu
dents.  All parents are encouraged to take an active role in their child's education as they 
assist their children with class and homework assignments.  Each year, our grade level teams present hands
-
on learning 
workshops for parents in both English and Sp
anish that are designed to address AVID, English Language Arts, Mathematics 
and science learning activities.
 
 
Additionally, the principal provides general parent meetings, which focus on helping parents navigate through the new 
adopted curriculum and how t
o provide supportive activities at home. Sessions are provided in English and Spanish upon 
request. Parent
-
Teacher Conferences are available throughout the school year to discuss the academic and social progress 
of our students. Additional workshops are he
ld with parents of our English Language Learners and for our  students at risk. 
Parents are invited to join the School Site Council, P.T.S.A. and our  English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) 
committees. Beatty holds Title I Parent meetings that provide e
ducational information and hands
-
on learning activities 
for parents.
 
 
To ensure that we provide ongoing and current communication with the school, Beatty publishes a monthly Parent 
Newsletter. Additional forms of communication include using Class Dojo, Sch
ool Messenger notifications, and flyers that 
are hard copy or electronically sent to parents' email and smart phone addresses. We are fortunate to have an electronic 
marquee that posts weekly information and our Beatty district website is available.

Professional Development Plan:
 
 
Teachers attend  professional development sessions during the school year, focusing on school goals and newly adopted 
curriculum in language arts and math.  They continue to enroll in after school training sessions/collaboration with site 
staff members and
 
district instructional services staff. We continue the implementation of the InnovateEd Building 
Capacity program with our site's Leadership Advisory Team members.  Throughout the school year, teachers paired with 
another elementary school to increase the
ir knowledge and use of effective instructional practices, including writing and 
DOK strategies.  Teams conducted Common Core Learning Rounds as well, designed to provide student engagement data 
through classroom visitations.  During these sessions, our te
achers and staff members are supported by the principal, site 
level coaches, district personnel, and Riverside County Office of Education (RCOE) staff through the implementation and 
monitoring of effective instructional practices. Student data was analyzed
 
by grade level teams during team meetings and 
by teams and individual teachers with the principal.
 
 
 
2017
-
2018 Teachers received two professional development days provided by the district to help support them in their 
implementation of the ELA, ELD, Math,
 
and Digital Literacy and Digital Citizenship standards.  For example, on August 19 
all certificated and classified staff attended all day PD training's at either King or Ramona HS in which staff members had 
a voice in determining what workshops would be m
ade available. During our summer training both certificated and 
classified teachers also received training on the substitute system, mandated reporting, and the new mandated reporting 
of P.E. minutes.  Team leaders will meet with an InnovateEd consultant s
ix times this school year to partake in instructional 
design and instructional rounds training. Teachers in grades TK
-
6  participated in Summer AVID training that focused on 
WICOR strategies that will help us prepare students to achieve college and career 
readiness.  Additionally, teachers 
received science training that will be used to address Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  Furthermore, teachers 
are working closely with our assigned district math and language arts professional development specia
lists to increase the 
learning outcomes of all Beatty students.  For instance, TK
-
2 teachers participated in the summer TK
-
2 Institute training 
focused on the use of the Orton
-
Gillingham program as a way of providing reading support for our most intensive 
students.  
Additionally our ELD Coach trained our two Bilingual Aides on the use of these K
-
2 Institute strategies so they would be 
able to support EL students in grades TK
-
6.

Patricia Beatty's students now have their own Chromebooks.  Teachers were trai
ned at the district level for the 
implementation of the Illuminate program, iReady language arts and mathematics programs, and continue to receive 
additional training on how to best utilize these programs.   In order to increase the academic achievement of
 
our Academic 
English Language Learner students, our 3rd through 6th grade ELD teachers attended an on site ELD analysis, support, and 
planning and session.   Portions of the learning gained from the training was shared with staff member during staff 
meeti
ngs and used by all teachers during planning and instruction.
 
 
 
All teachers continued to acquire valuable information concerning the effective implementation of common core teaching 
standards through the use of effective instructional strategies throughou
t the school year. Special Education teachers and 
aides were provided with training in language arts, mathematics and behavior management through the District Special 
Education Staff and designated providers. District Special Education Staff and the princi
pal provided assistance and 
guidance through individual meetings with teachers. If teachers desired to enhance their instructional skills, they are 
provided support through our coaches on campus, a variety of professional development sessions provided by R
USD, and 
through the Peer Assistance and Review program. Professional Development for clerical and custodial staff is held multiple 
times during the school year by various departments in RUSD. The principal monitors the implementation of new 
processes and 
procedures in order to gauge the processes effectiveness and plan for future professional development.

adoptions.
 
 
Additionally, the district provides instructional assistance in the areas of language Arts and Mathematics.  RUSD 
Instructional Specialists are available to help develop lessons using technology.  Using the Cycle of Inquiry model, the 
entire school staff participated in a collaborative investigation of how to achieve substantive and sustained school 
improvement.  With
 
this organizational structure, an environment was created that fostered mutual cooperation, 
emotional support, and personal growth. Additionally, the principal, coaches, and staff worked with Riverside County 
Schools Consultant in the area of Language Art
s.  The principal is the primary instructional leader at the site.  Instruction 
is monitored through classroom walk

range goals and plans.  PD days
 
are planned to engage in analyzing, planning, actions, and reflections for addressing our 
students' needs.  Staff members will continue to focus on our Strength Finder strengths.
 
 
Our goal as educators is to increase our understanding and implementation o
f AVID and PBIS lessons and activities 
designed to enhance the program and equip our students with 21st century learning experiences.  During the 2019

school year, we will increase our understanding of best  practices by collaborating with other AVID sc
hools.   We are 
committed to AVID and will continue to focus on lessons and activities that align with the  AVID Elementary ideals.  Writing,
 
Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and Reading are focus areas designed to increase our students' achievement a

development.
 
 
Our analysis of SBAC data leads us to focus on the Reading Claim for English Language Arts and on Concepts and 
Procedures in the area of Mathematics.  Our staff and team meetings will strategically focus on continuous Clarity, 
Commitment, 
Accountability and Collaboration and engage in professional development activities to ensure the success 
of our students.
