About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and the community are very supportive of the educational programs in the El Segundo Unified School District. Parents 
are visible in the classrooms 
and workroom on a daily basis. The School Site Council and PTA
 
are both very active, supporting classroom instruction and special classroom events. The 
school has benefited from the fundraising efforts of both groups, which have provided major improvements to the campus such a
s new playgrounds. 
Studio 109, a group of
 
parent volunteers with a passion for the arts, has been organized to ensure that a quality art instruction and enrichment is 
available 
to all students. The business community is very involved in El Segundo, and in 1983, the El Segundo Educational Foundati
on was founded to raise 
supplemental funding for the school system. Other local community businesses providing support to Richmond Street Elementary 
School include, but 
are not limited to: Los Angeles Kings, Cold Stone Creamery, El Segundo Chamber of Comme
rce, Kiwanis  and Rotary Club.
 
 
St
ate Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Richmond Street Elementary School. Richmond Street Elementary School emp
loys noon duty 
supervisors to monitor students during their lunch break. Richmond staff supervise students before school and during
 
regularly scheduled breaks. After 
school supervision is provided on campus for a fee. The front of the school is designated for student drop
-
off/pick
-
up. All visitors to the campus must 
sign in at the office and display a visitor pass at all times. The Sc
hool Site Safety plan is evaluated and revised annually each summer by administrators, 
the El Segundo Fire Department, School Site Council, and members of the Parent Teacher Association; the revisions are then sh
ared with the entire staff. 
Key elements to 
the safety plan include evacuation plans and drills, shelter
-
in
-
place and dismissal procedures, location and rationing of first aide supplies, 
and implementation of the SEMS (Standardized Emergency Management System) Model. The school is in compliance with
 
the laws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.

The El Segundo Unified School District has a long history of providing support for teachers to participate in professional de
velopment activities. Through 
attendance at workshops and conferences, the staff at Richmond 
Street School has developed a common language and vision that defines the school 
community. Teachers are empowered in all elements of site based decisions from curriculum and instruction, to program assessm
ent, to school policies 
and discipline procedures.
 
For the past three years, the District has sponsored three staff development days annually, where teachers are offered a 
variety of growth opportunities. In addition, each Monday is a minimum day. This time is dedicated to staff meetings, grade l
evel/depa
rtment meetings, 
and professional development. Topics include but are not limited to: Common Core English Language Arts, Common Core Mathemati
cs, Cognitive Guided 
Instruction, Next Generation Science Standards, Technology, and differentiated instructional 
strategies. Recently credentialed teachers are provided 
additional assistance through the Beginning Teacher Support and Assistance Program (BTSA).

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 
2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 

l districts receive money 
from the state. Previously school districts received a significant portion of money without restrictions,
 
but much of the funding was restricted to specific 
programs, called categorical programs. Some examples of these categorical programs included textbook funds and the Regional O
ccupation Program for 
high school students. There were dozens of state categori
cal programs that were eliminated when the LCFF went into effect in July 2013.
 
 

trate how funds will be used 
to address eight prior
ities established by the state, school districts must develop and approve a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) no later
 
than 
July 1 of each year. This three
-
year plan is to be updated annually. Once approved by the Board of Education, the LCAP will b
e the basis for expenditures 
in the District.
 
 
The eight priorities that El Segundo Unified School District will include in the LCAP include the following:
 

 
Student Achievement
 

 
Student Engagement
 

 
Other Student Outcomes
 

 
School Climate
 

 
Parental Involvement
 

 
Basic Services
 

 
Implementation of the
 
Common Core Standards
 

 
Course Access
