By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

school to conti
nually improve in three areas: School Climate (Students, Parents, and Programs), Emergency Preparedness 
(Disasters and Crisis), and School Environment (Facilities and Campus). The plan addresses various safety issues, including 
creating procedures that det
ect and prevent bullying, ensuring appropriate campus supervision, maintaining disaster kits, 
and monitoring emergency procedures. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated each year and approved by the 
School Site Council and the Board of Education.
  
The plan is reviewed with all staff members at the beginning of each 
school year. Safety drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held four times a
 
year, and intruder/lockdown drills are held at least once a
 
year. Staff members also receive disaster training on a regular 
basis.
 
 
To ensure student safety, teachers, administrators, and school proctors supervise students on campus before and after 
school, and during breaks and lunch. Baldwin Stocker Elementary S
chool has a closed campus, and permission is always 

office and must wear the proper identification badge at all times.

Under the current Local Control Funding Formula, districts like Arcadia Unified School District, with low numbers of 
unduplicated students receive far less ongoing money to implement the California Academic Standards compared to 
neighboring districts with 

youth).  These high unduplicated count districts receive supplemental and concentration grant monies to purchase 
materials, hire consultants, and pay for hours 
of professional development for their instructional and student support 
staffs.
 
 
In the Fall of 2013, the Arcadia Unified School District negotiated an interest
-
based solution for California Academic 
Standards implementation with its bargaining units to ad
d three days to the school calendar for two years starting in the 
2014
-
15 school year. Negotiations produced an agreement to spread the three days of additional paid time over seven 
early release days with development time of 2.5 hours per day built into t
he schedule.  Since 2015, AUSD leadership has 
negotiated annual agreements with its bargaining units to continue the additional three days for professional 
development.
 
 

d the Collaboration Time Advisory 
Council (C
-
TAC) with the task of putting legs to the plan. C
-
TAC is a representative group made up of bargaining unit 
members and management team members who were charged with serving as an advisory committee to the Distri
ct in the 
implementation of the district
-
wide California Academic Standards Collaboration Time supporting TK
-
12 instructional 
programs both vertically and horizontally, as they made dramatic instructional and curricular shifts.
 
 
The commitment from both ou
r bargaining units and management was to build research
-
based professional development 
around small collaborative working groups. Each group would be designed intentionally to have a vertical alignment of 
teachers from TK
-
12 engaged in the work together.
 
 
In late Spring of 2014, the C
-
TAC committee reached out to all certificated staff to assist with generating ideas for the 
content of the Collaboration Days. The committee, after reviewing and discussing the many ideas that were submitted 
and looking at sur
vey data, generated a list of themes which became the foundation of the Collaboration Days and assisted 
in guiding the development of a Course Group Catalogue. The planning of the Collaboration Days was research based, 
focused on meaningful work, teacher c
hoice, flexibility, and ongoing commitment. The Professional Development was 
designed around teacher interests that included creating autonomous choice for teachers and support providers in 
relation to where they felt they could best contribute their train
ing, talents, interests, and education, by participating in 
Small Working Groups (SWaG) and engaging with other professionals to continue the real work of implementing the 
California Academic Standards.  C
-
TAC continues to act as the advisory body for the 
Collaboration Days, reviewing survey 
data and requests for course offerings, and considering suggestions for improvements to the program.

Each SWaG is led by a self
-
selected Facilitator from amongst the various stakeholder groups and has been charged with
 
collaborating both with colleagues at their own site and with fellow professionals from other district sites. Mentor
-
leaders 
support Facilitators by providing support throughout implementation of this professional development. The crystal
-
clear 
goals of t
he Collaboration Days include producing a comprehensive and fully articulated Arcadia California Academic 
Standards Core Curriculum in English
-
Language Arts and Mathematics; to research and make recommendations for 
curriculum and instructional shifts towar
ds a more personalized approach to learning in the Social Sciences, Sciences, 
Foreign Languages, Physical Education, Electives, Visual and Performing Arts, Character Education, Technology 
implementation, English
-
Language Development, Next Generation Scienc
e Standards implementation, Project

Learning, Innovative Instruction, Google Classroom and various online and Open Educational Resources, and Special 
Education from a Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 12 perspective. Data continues to be collected f
rom the SWaGs 
through group evaluations and is then disaggregated and shared through various modalities to each stakeholder group.
 
 
In recent years, additional professional development resources have been designated for Mathematics and English
-
Language cur
riculum development and 21st Century instructional skill development, including National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) conferences, Thinking Maps, and Write From the Beginning, in support of California 
Academic Standards implementation, Illumin
ate data and assessment system, AVID, Advanced Placement, and Next 
Generation Science Standards. At the high school level, data indicated that a large segment of potentially college
-
bound 
students were not being provided access and opportunity to pursue ho
nors and college
-
level courses, as their high
-
achieving classmates were. Leadership worked with teachers to engage in professional development around the themes 
of Advanced Placement (AP) open access and equity for all students over the past two years. Pro
fessional Development 
resources have been designated to send teachers, counselors and leadership to the local and regional College Board/A.P. 
Forums. Continued professional development will be pursued at the national level.
 
 
Full implementation of the Adva
ncement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program continues to be a focus of 
professional development dollars over the past seven years.
 
 
Individual school sites have been tasked with working with the Instructional Coaches to conduct professional develop
ment 
around the themes of the California Academic  Standards, including rigor, focus, coherence, instructional strategies, shifts 
in curriculum, pacing and instructional materials, writing instruction and problem
-
solving.  Arcadia Instructional Coaches 
hav
e become regional professional development leaders by presenting at conferences and through their instituting the 
San Gabriel Valley Instructional Coaches Consortium.
 
 
Staff development topics from  2012

2018 school years have included effective 
instruction and critical thinking, 
implementation of the electronic grade book, the California Academic Standards, identification, development and curation 
of online resources, pedagogical shifts, brain research and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and 
Innovative Instruction.
