School Description
 

 
 
Garfield is a community of learners who are committed to ensuring that every child who comes 
into our school receives an equitable education within a nurturing and safe environment. The 
strength of our school lies with the staff who are knowledgeable, thou
ghtful and caring, and who 
share the belief that all students can learn and embrace the skills that will make them lifelong 
learners. Our teaching faculty of highly qualified, fully credentialed teachers is dedicated to 
teaching students a rigorous core ac
ademic curriculum based on the Common Core Standards and 
Next Generation Science Standards.  They collaborate and analyze data regularly to produce deeper 
learning opportunities for our students including an analysis of academic performance and 
language de
velopment to determine English Learners (EL) program needs as well as other student 
group needs.
 
 
Garfield School is made up of a diverse student body. The school serves students in grades 
Transitional Kindergarten to 5th grade. Additional resources are al
located to serve students in need 
of Reading and Math Intervention, English Language Development instruction, Speech, and 
Language support, Special Education Resource services, Adaptive Physical Education, Occupational 
Therapy, and Counseling. Students als
o participate in Music, Art, Physical Education classes taught 
by Specialists.
 
 

and services are effectively coordinated to meet the needs of students. Our 
teachers strive to 
provide students with explicit direct instruction lessons and project
-
based learning (PBL) 
opportunities that are combined with blended learning opportunities in our digital learning 
environments.  It is always our goal to provide academ
ic programs that are culturally responsive, 
rigorous, personalized and appropriately challenging for all students.
 
 
Instruction is focused on the Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards and all students 
are making progress towards mastery. Garfield teachers differentiate their instruction by regularly 
assessing and grouping students within and/or outside of th
e classroom for instruction in a variety 
of core academic content areas. Through this process, teachers can work together to meet the 
needs of all students by sharing resources and best instructional practices. These practices align 
activities to reach sch
ool goals to improve the academic performance of multilingual learners and 
students who require additional intervention to support their learning needs.  Recognizing the need 
to focus on the whole child, our teachers also provide learning experiences which
 
foster

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/
ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Parents and the community are very supportive of the education program at Garfield Elementary School. Parents may participate
 
in the Gatorville Parent 
Teacher Organization (PTO), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Sch
ool Site Council (SSC), and volunteer within the classroom and for various 
school events and field trips. The PTO and ELAC groups sponsor a variety of fundraising and community
-
building activities throughout the school year. 
Their fundraisers also sponsor 
field trips for every student.  Each year, parents are invited to attend our six
-
session School Smarts Academy.  The 
curriculum for the academy is designed by the National PTA. It helps parents understand how to navigate the school system and
 
advocate for 
their 
children.
 
 
Garfield Elementary School has several partnerships with local community organizations and businesses, such as Davis Street C
ommunity Center, City of 
San Leandro Safe Routes to School,  the San Leandro Rotary, and the San Leandro Education
, Sports, and Music Foundations.

drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year, and intruder drills are con
ducted twice a year. Emergency parent information is 
outlined in the Parent/Student Handbook and provided each year to families.
 
 
To ensure student safety, staff members supervise students at all times before and after 
school, and during recess and lunch. Any visitors to the campus 
are required to check

are supervised by staff. The Safe School Plan was last reviewed in January 2020 by the School Site Council and staff.
