School Description
 
Stowers
 
Magnet School of International Studies is proud to have earned the prestigious honor and 
title as an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School,  California Distinguished School, and a 
California Gold Ribbon School.  As a California Distinguished Schoo
l and a Gold ribbon School we 
are one of California's most exemplary and inspiring public schools. Stowers is committed to 
providing an inquiry based, rigorous and challenging academic program centered around the 
interdisciplinary themes of our IB Units of
 
Study.  Our IB program contributes to the development 
of the whole child as students are taught to question and assess their own understanding in order 
to apply their knowledge in meaningful ways. Stowers students learn to inquire, develop, and 
explore qu
estions that lead them to learn about and solve real
-
world problems. Another 
component of the Stowers IB Program is that all students receive instruction in a second language, 
Spanish.  At Stowers, instruction focuses on the depth and breadth of academics 
as well as 
developing our students into globally minded citizens able to embrace and succeed in the world of 
the 21st century.  By providing Inquiry
-
Based teaching and learning our students are exposed to 
important and relevant content anchored in Californ
ia Content Standards.  We also offer programs 
in GATE, Special Education, as well as English Language Development.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
At Stowers, our focus is to develop a strong academic foundation in each of our students based on 
inquiry, depth of knowle
dge, and a passion for learning.  As a Magnet School of International 
Studies, we agree to help students learn and practice the IB learner profiles and attitudes.  We will 
give students the opportunity to learn how to become lifelong learners, allow them t
o express 
themselves, be supportive of their ideas, and give them a global education where they develop 
empathy, understanding, and caring towards others.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). 
The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP),
 
which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to th
e University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction with the focus on student achie
vement.  
Professional development is based on the assessed needs of the school personnel and highlighted by student testing data. 
Faculty members work 
collaboratively on a weekly basis to determine the school's needs and take direction from District, State, and International 
Baccalaureate requirements 
when identifying professional development goals for the school year.  School
-
wide f
aculty training focus areas include technology, differentiation of 
instruction, and using data to drive instruction. Faculty members build teaching skills and concepts by participating in  con
ferences and workshops 
throughout the year, and by sharing their
 
experiences and knowledge with colleagues. Our District offers professional development, and funds to school 
sites for professional development activities. Professional Learning Communities and Secondary Literacy are examples of distr
ict wide professional
 
development.
