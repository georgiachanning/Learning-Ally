By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Curriculum Framework adopted by the State Board of Education in the following subject areas: mathematics, science, 
history
-

adoptions contain specific curriculum for technology use where teachers and students can take advantage of our 
computer lab and high
-
speed internet access.
 
 
Textbooks used
 
in all schools in the Susanville School District are purchased from the State
-
adopted list. Teachers in the 
District form textbook adoption committees to decide which series best meets the learning needs of our students. All 
students are provided texts fo

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
McKinley School was built in 1949, with an additional 
wing added in 1964. The original portion of the building was also 
remodeled in 1994. Plans currently exist for a modernization project, should funding become available in the future. 
Including our portables, we currently have 28 classrooms, one computer la
b, one learning center, and a trailer used by 
our school psychologist and some county employees.
 
 
Owing to its age, the facility requires a great deal of custodial and maintenance attention to keep it operating in a way 
that supports student learning, comf
ort, and safety. Among the interior improvements over the past several years are 
changes to the library, including the purchase of additional books and materials to support students in their reading and 
research activities.
 
 
All classrooms have Internet ca
pable computers and the computer lab was recently relocated and expanded so that it 
could accommodate a whole class of students at one time. Wireless access points allow connectivity throughout the 
campus as well. Chromebook carts have been added for use i
n classrooms as needed by teaching staff. The school has two 
large grass ball fields and playground sets to provide recreational activities for our students and for the community during 
non
-
school hours.
 
 
The school is in good repair and has one full
-
time 
and one part
-
time custodian. The day custodian works from 6:00 A.M. 
to 1:30 P.M. and the evening custodian works from 2:00 P.M. to 10:30 P.M.  The school receives an in
-
depth cleaning 
during the summer.
 
 
Our students are supervised on the playground or in 
the Multipurpose Room starting at 7:45 A.M. Staff members have 
assigned duty times throughout the day including during dismissal. Teachers are asked to use a buddy system and passes 
during the day. All visitors to our campus are asked to register with our 
new electronic sign
-
in process.  VIP Pass helps the 
school track visitors/volunteers and improves the overall safety of the campus.  This new program began operation in the 
fall of 2018.
 
 
Through passage of a bond by the community, extensive work was 
completed during the summer of 2013 as the 
playgrounds were redesigned and new asphalt was installed.  Additionally, security cameras and a new bell/intercom 
system was installed replacing the old, inadequate devices.  Drainage was improved on the back of 
the school and new 
play equipment was installed.  District Administration worked with an Architect to develop a Master Plan for the campus 
and several priorities were identified for work in the near future.  In the summer of 2016, the District completed a 
maintenance project to repair the parking lot areas and make pick
-
up/drop
-
off more safe for students.  Additionally, a 
new boiler was installed to better control the heat throughout the campus during the cold winter months.

Through the Local Control Accou
ntability Plan (LCAP), the District prioritizes facility and maintenance needs for the school 
each year and provides budgetary resources to keep McKinley in top condition for student learning.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are many 
opportunities for parents to become involved at McKinley ranging from school
-
wide leadership roles such 
as School Site Council to volunteering in our classrooms or library. McKinley has an active Parent Teacher Association 
(PTA). Participating in evening e
vents focusing on math, literature, and/or fine arts is another important way for parents 

conversations and/or conferences about the progress you
r child is making and ways that we can work as a team to support 

happened at school

in class and outside of class

are involved in a way t
hat clearly tells your child how important their 
job of being a student is. Annually, parents are invited to be a part of the District's LCAP committee to help prioritize the
 
District's goals and actions.
 
 
McKinley School utilizes a parent
-
dialing service 
(Schoolwise) to communicate with parents regarding important events at 
the school and about student activities.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

The safety of students, staff, and visitors is of primary importance at this school. The School Safety Plan was 
most recently 
reviewed, updated, and approved by the School Site Council in February 2019.  The plan was reviewed with school faculty 
in September 2019 at the beginning of the school year. The School Safety Plan covers safety procedures for natural 
disaste
rs and other emergency situations and includes the various emergency drills, lock
