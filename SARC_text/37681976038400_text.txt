DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Intern
et access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first

served basis. Other use 
restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https:/
/www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Professional learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a c
ommon language around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards throug
h the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experi
ence, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face p
rofessional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
based
 
instruction, Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can u
se to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
With
 
professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that
 
it is relevant, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to 
analyze student data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
 
 
The district offers workshops and multiple
-
day seminars, after
-
school workshops, online courses, and one
-
on
-
one coaching and modeling. Select teachers 
also 
attend conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing pr
ofessional development 
at site learning days and staff meetings.
