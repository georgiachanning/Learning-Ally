By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Goshen Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space i
s provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff workrooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of

Maintenance and 
Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the hi
ghest priority.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, there was general maintenance and upkeep of school facilities.  No other emergency 
facilities need to exist at this school.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the 
school day, a team of maintenance specialists comes in after
-
hours for 
daily cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules 
to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Progr
am
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement existing school building
 
components
.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all classrooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequa
cy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
Goshen Elementary School has been recently modernization funded by Measure E (2018
-
2019); modernizing student 
bathrooms, administration office, faculty room, adding a library, and cla
ssroom repairs. All classrooms have television 
screens with the latest technology for instruction as well as modernized student desks, chairs, and teacher work
-
station 
furniture.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information
 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general e
ducation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAA
s items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses th
at satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous 
Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: professional learning communities (PLC's), 
Social
-
Emotional Learning, effective math and literacy instruction, and other areas as indicated by school data.  Our 
district 
provides professional development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are 
being addressed.  Professional Development occurs at the district, school, and classroom level dependent on teacher 
goals. The
 
district provides Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA's) at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and 
support after professional development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, t


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified off
ers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institut
e which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and 
cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings wi
th their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours,
 
and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors 
and teachers on assignments 
are carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Cle
ar Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be need
ed in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
 
 
Professional Development is held each Monday after schoo
l to train teachers in best practices, review data on behavior 
and academic progress, verify alignment with the school's SPSA goals, then determine the next steps. Paraprofessionals 
are also trained once a month on instruction and student supervision. All 
staff members are trained in social
-
emotional 
wellness.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA's) provide teachers with support in the areas of instruction, classroom 
management, curriculum, and assessment.

Questions to support student comprehension. Our work continues 
to expand and transfer knowledge into Independent 
Reading and Writing extensions.  As for Math, each grade level is working on Making Sense of math problems, receiving 
district support with VTN Math TOSAS.  The CSI process and VTN Math support have helped 
our staff and PLC's to come 
together to strategize, plan, implement instruction on learning goals with specific strategies and leveled questions, then 
look at reflections on student data and respond to instruction.  There are three half

as well as individual 
and grade level coaching. According to CAASPP, Goshen Elementary students have grown significantly in the areas of ELA

The principal 
provides feedback and coaching to teachers individually during instruction as well as in meetings. The site 
principal also receives coaching from the area superintendent, as well as active participation in PLC's.
