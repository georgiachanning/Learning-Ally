By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
October 22, 2019
 
 
Needles Unified School District held a public hearing October 22, 2019, and determined each school within the District 
had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and science lab
 
equipment, pursuant to the settlement 
of Williams vs. the State of California. In addition, the District ensured sufficiency of visual and performing arts material
s 
for the 2019
-
2020 school year.  All students, including English Learners, have access to t
heir own textbooks, instructional 
materials, and visual and performing arts materials to use in class and at home. Supplemental materials that support 
students with special needs are also provided using categorical funds, lottery funds, and grants. When St
ate textbook 
funds do not meet our needs, general fund dollars are allocated by our governing board to ensure our textbook needs are 
met.
 
 
The adoption of Mathematics Common Core State Standards in 2010, revisions in 2013, and the move to CAASPP 
Assessment
s in 2013, created a void in the availability of California SBE adopted textbooks that addressed the new 
standards and assessments.  This led to some districts, including Needles Unified, to identify and adopt curriculum which 
will better meet the needs of
 
students and improve the likelihood of success in the classroom and on state assessments.  
The most recent CA SBE Math adoption in 2014, included new instructional materials, but none fit the needs of the district.  
enVision Math 2.0, by Pearson, was eval
uated prior to the start of the 2016
-
17 school year and found by the NUSD to be 
consistent with the California State Standards.  On June 28, 2016, Pearson, enVistion Math 2.0 was adopted by the Needles 
Unified School District Board of Trustees for grades T

In November of 2017, the California State Board of Education adopted ten Elementary and Middle School History

Science textbook and instructional materials/programs.  Due to budgetary constraints, Needles Unified has not approved, 
purchased, or

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Vista Colorado Elementary School was built in the early 1950s. All classrooms exit outdoors. There are 13 main classrooms, 
six portable classrooms, a library, and the school office.  One portable classroom is used by the SELPA counselor. The
 
remaining five portable classrooms are used as regular classrooms. The main playground consists of a large grass field, 
concrete basketball courts, and a wood chip area containing the swings.  Grades 1~5 use the main playground, while 
kindergarten uses a 
self
-
contained playground containing a grass play area, swings, and a small climbing apparatus.  All 
students use the district cafeteria, which is located on the Needles Middle School campus.   Modernization of the Vista 
Colorado Elementary School campus h
as been completed. The modernization projects were funded through local bond 
funds and State matching funds.
 
 
Cleaning Schedule: The District governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary 
of these standards is av
ailable at the school office or at the District office. The principal works daily with the district staff 
to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Cleanliness and Adequacy of School Facilities: Students are encouraged to have pride
 
in their school and keep the campus 
clean. Classrooms, office areas, cafeteria, restrooms, and playground areas are cleaned and maintained on a regular basis. 
Student rest rooms are spot checked throughout the day and maintained with adequate soap and pap
er supplies. 
Schoolwide procedures are in place for the playground, hallways, cafeteria and bathrooms to ensure student safety. 
Procedures are taught to all students and enforced by all school personnel.  School and/or district personnel evaluate the 
campu
s at various times throughout the day to keep the school safe, orderly, and clean.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff members perform the repairs necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and working order in a timely manner. A work
-
orde
r process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority. Regular and corrective maintenance is handled on a priority daily basis and 
emergencies are handled immediately.  The site administrators, custodian, a
nd District personnel conduct routine physical 
inspections for safety and maintenance. Site custodial staff and the District maintenance staff provide ongoing custodial 
and maintenance services.
 
 
Student fire drills and drop and cover drills are conducted 
monthly. The school has a current disaster preparedness and 
safety plan that is approved by the School Site Council and Board of Trustees annually.
 
 
Williams Monitoring:  Vista Colorado Elementary was visited by representatives from the San Bernardino Coun
ty 
Superintendent of Schools on August 23,2019, as part of the Williams monitoring process.  Williams monitoring visits are  
used to verify sufficient instructional materials in the four core subject areas (English language arts, mathematics, 
history/socia
l science, science), and to determine if there is any facility condition that poses an emergency, or urgent 
threat to the health of safety of pupils and staff. Findings of the August 23, 2019, visit reported that there were no 
observed insufficiencies of i
nstructional materials and there were no facilities findings.
 
 
Vista Colorado Elementary has an overall rating of good based upon the District's most recent inspection.
 
 
Needles Unified has applied and was awarded a grant for the construction of new kinder
garten facilities.  The District is in 
the early stages of planning the improvements.  Currently at Vista, there is adequate classroom and ancillary space

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

office, state their business at the school, and show identification. They are then provided with a name tag to wear while 
on school grounds. A safe, secure tea
ching and learning environment is of the highest priority to Educational Training 
Center administration.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in August 2020.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional Development is an integral aspect of the District's plan for the ongoing growth of all District employees. The 
purpose of professional development is to create schools in which all students and staff members are learners who 
continually improv
e their performance.
 
 
In addition, school sites have ongoing staff development at their respective schools. The District has provided weekly Early 
Release Days on Wednesdays with instructional time still exceeding or meeting the State requirements. The foc
us during 
early release days is to professional development on California State Standards and effective instructional strategies as 
well as teacher collaboration with their colleagues and administration to develop best practices being used within their 
sch
ool site. Administration, staff and consultants work together to provide these professional development sessions.
 
 
Principals are engaged in the study of research
-
based practices which increase student learning. Professional development 
is a part of every 
principals meeting.
 
 
Additional collaboration time was encouraged for all grade levels following the school year to develop Common Core State 
Standards' Scope and Sequence for the next school year.  All grade levels participated in this work.
 
 
We successfu
lly support beginning teachers in their first and second year of teaching with research
-
based coaching 
programs.  Each beginning teacher receives expert help from an experienced Support Provider.
