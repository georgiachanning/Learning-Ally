By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kid
s.com.
 
 
The main entrance of Sonoma School is accessed through an electric front door into a long hallway. This is to accommodate 
the physically handicapped students on campus. A Modesto City Schools sign is posted at the entrance stating that all 
visitors
 
are required to check in with the front office. A visitor sign
-
in sheet, stickers and badges are located at the front 

for breakfast.
 
Approximately 80
-
100 students eat breakfast on campus each day. Students are allowed on the 
playground/campus at 8:40a.m. At that time classified and/or certificated school personnel are providing yard duty 
supervision. The yard duty schedule is as follow
s: Recess 8:40
-
8:55, 10:30
-
10:45, 10:45
-
11:00,11:00
-
11:15, 1:45
-
2:00. A 
minimum of three yard duty employees watch students during these recess times. Three yard duty employees supervise 
the students during the three lunch shifts between 11:35p.m. 

 
1:15p.
m. A certificated teacher oversees Traffic Patrol, 
school crossing guards before and after school. The parking lot is closed before and after school except for the buses of 
physically handicapped students. Certificated and/or classified employees wait at t
he bus zone to greet students exiting 
the bus at arrival time and assist students boarding the buses at dismissal time.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clea
n, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
This school has classrooms, a cafeteria, library, pool building, staff room, and an administration office. CCS Therapy Unit 
also shares a portion of the campus. The main campus was bui
lt in 1973 and opened in 1973.

Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient s
ervice. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The Operations Department has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
are available at the school office, or at the Maintenance & Operations office. The Operations Department works 
continuously with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance:
 
The District partic
ipated in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provided flexible state matching funds 
to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school facilities components. State 
contributions to this Program
 
ended in the 2012
-
13 school year. Deferred Maintenance typically includes paving, roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems. Carry
-
over funds for 
deferred maintenance projects through
out the District in Funds 01 and 14 have been exhausted. The Board has authorized 
the General Fund to annually contribute $2 million to Facility Maintenance to be used for new construction and 
maintenance projects throughout the District, $2 million to Def
erred Maintenance for maintenance projects throughout 

against all other District site repairs and the most urgent repairs are addres
sed first..

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

way and meaningful.
 
 
Newsletters/flyers are sent home by PTA and administration to inform parents of upcoming events and important 
information. Face
book PTA accounts are set up to strengthen communication. The school website is updated and 
promoted for student and parent communication. Sonoma hosts a "Round Up" prior to the beginning of the school year 
for parents and students to learn about the progr
ams being offered throughout the school year and the different ways to 
get involved. Sonoma hosts a Back To School Night during the first month of school as an opportunity for parents to meet 

utines/expectations and grade level curriculum.
 
 
Parents are welcome in the school and are actively pursued for volunteering.
 
 
Parents are encouraged to participate in committees such as Parent Engagement Committee, English Language Learners 
Partnership, S
onoma PTA and the School Safety Committee. Meeting agendas are published 72 hours in advance for these 
meetings and all parents are encouraged to attend even if they are not an elected member.

minimum days, important deadlines or school safety concerns, etc. A copy of the Parental Involvement Plan is located in 
the front office so t
hat it is accessible to parents.
 
 
COLLABORATE
 
Parents play an integral role in assisting student learning. Through effective collaboration we will see an increase in stude
nt 
achievement. Parent support and assistance is needed and welcomed. The school part
ners with parent and community 
organizations to assist in achieving our school goals. Parenting skills are promoted and supported. Parents are encouraged 
to participate in site level and district level committees to advocate for raising the level of academ
ic achievement.
 
 
CELEBRATE
 
It is imperative to take time to celebrate our achievements throughout the school year. Parents need to be included in the 

nd student recognition 
assemblies on a monthly basis where students are honored for Student of the Month, Character Traits, Attendance, etc.
 
Parents are invited to the annual Open House Night in the spring to view completed projects and student work. Paren

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
