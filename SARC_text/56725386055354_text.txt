School Description
 
McKinna Vision:
 
To develop creative and critical thinkers, problem solvers and  leaders who are prepared for college 
and the future as contributing members of society.
 
 
District Biliteracy Vision: We will work together to provide students the opportunity to become 
biliter
ate, bilingual and multicultural through a rigorous academic program so they can develop to 
their fullest potential as global citizens.
 
 
McKinna Mission:
 
We, the teachers and staff of McKinna School are committed to ensure that each of our students 
reaches
 
his or her full potential through high expectations, ongoing collaboration, and targeted, 

students are supported academically, emotionally and socially to devel
op to their fullest potential.  
We consider families to be our most essential partners in achieving this mission!
 
 
The staff, parents, and students at McKinna School work together to support and maintain a safe 
and secure school environment that is conduci
ve to learning and that
 
provides opportunities for each student to develop personal and social responsibility, self
-
esteem, 
respect, and consideration for others, and a high level of academic achievement.
 
 
The staff works closely with one another to ensure
 
that all students receive a high quality 
instructional program. By the time students leave fifth grade, we want them to have the academic 
and social skills needed to be successful in the future

namely the ability to think critically and 
creatively about t
he personal and societal choices that face them.
 
 
We celebrate the diversity of our student body and feel that all children benefit from knowing, 
learning about and experiencing other languages and cultures. McKinna is a
 
learning community where student ne
eds drive all decisions.  We welcome all families  as essential 
partners of the McKinna school community.

McKinna is home to the Elementary Newcomer Program for the Oxnard District, and  serves newcomers to the country  in grades 3
-
5. This 
diverse group of students and their families adds ri
ch opportunities for the McKinna community to learn and appreciate a wide range of 
cultures. As stated in the OSD Master Plan for English Learners, elementary newcomer students are assessed in the Enrollment 
Center to 
determine primary language proficiency
. Those who demonstrate grade
-
level proficiency in Spanish may be placed into alternative 
bilingual programs based on parental option and program availability. The Elementary Newcomer Program provides newly arrived 
English 
Learners with a specialized envir
onment where they receive an intensive English acquisition program while they learn about their new 
school environment, culture, and country. Through use of appropriate curriculum and methods, students are able to acquire bas
ic 
comprehension and progress t
o the Emerging and Bridging of language proficiency, including academic language.
 
 
Newcomer Program Goals include the following areas of focus:   1. Familiarize students with US culture and US schools.    2. 
Facilitate their 
adaptation to their new environ
ment.    3. Provide a program that will allow students to develop English Fluency and high levels of 
comprehension as rapidly as possible.   4. Develop academic language related to the core content areas.   5. Master core acad
emic 
standards.
 
 
McKinna is th
rilled to be offering a pathway to biliteracy through the District Dual Language Immersion Program.  This year the DLI progra
m 
will be implemented with kindergarten and 1st grade students in a 50/50 model which means K & 1st grade students will receive
 
ins
truction in both English and Spanish daily. Every year over the next 4 years, McKinna will offer the DLI program to an additi
onal grade 

-
5th grade students 
will have the opportunity to become biliterate, bilingual and muticultural through a rigorous academic program so they can de
velop to 
their fullest potential as global citizens.
 
 
As McKinna
 
is transitioning to school wide DLI, McKinna will continue to offer other programs and resources to support English Learners 
and to facilitate successful academic English language acquisition.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, McKinna continues to implemen
t the 
Transitional Bilingual Program for grades 2nd 
-
3rd.  This program utiliizes  Spanish instruction to assist students in their transition to 
English instruction across all content areas.  In addition, all English Learners in K
-
5th grade are supported w
ith highly trained teachers and 
support staff who utilize  supports for oracy throughout the day to scaffold rigorous Common Core Standards across content ar
eas.   
Numerous teachers and support staff like ISPs and para
-
educators are bilingual and available
 
to offer support for students in English and 
Spanish as needed within Sheltered English Instruction (SEI) classes and within the Newcomer Academy as well.   All English L
anguage  
Learners receive differentiated ELD (English Language Development) instructi
on daily within designated and integrated ELD to further 
support acquisition of academic English language.
 
 
McKinna is a multi
-
media
-
 
STEAM "Strand Focus" that continues to utilize technology along with science/math and art to foster high 
student engagemen
t.   In 2012, McKinna was named an Apple Distinguished Program, an honor shared by very few schools in the United 
States. This designation was renewed recently and will stay in effect through 2022 school year. During the fall of 2017, McKi
nna was 
named an 
exemplary school by the VC STEM Network, a group of diverse stakeholders including educators, business and community 
agencies, that seek to improve access to opportunities that will improve educational outcomes for all students. Every student
 
at McKinna 
ha
s access to 1:1 mobile technology during the school day and the staff is committed to the integration of technology into the 
curriculum.  
McKinna's goal is to move students from consumers to creators of digital content. Staff members consistently work on i
mproving skills in 
the delivery of technology and curriculum in order to provide McKinna students with the best possible educational experience 
as 21st 
Century Learners.
 
 
The McKinna community works collaboratively to foster responsive, restorative systems
 
within a Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) 
framework to create a healthy learning environment where students thrive.  McKinna staff is committed to the implementation o
f a 
proactive and positive behavior support system (PBIS) school wide.  The PBIS L
eadership Team works within the Safe & Civil School model 
through a continuous improvement process to guide the entire staff through the construction and implementation of a comprehen
sive 
approach to behavior support.  This approach is proactive, positive,
 
and instructional offering an alternative means of correction to 
address student behavior that preserves student attendance and builds student responsibility, self
-
control and civic awareness. The goal 
of the Safe and Civil School model is to reduce all b
ehavioral and motivational barriers to learning by promoting safety and pro
-
social 
behavior, by supporting both academic and social emotional learning, and by enhancing staff consistency in teaching positive 
behavior 
expectations school wide.  During the 2
019
-
20 school year, the PBIS Leadership Team will receive ongoing training to help build adult 
capacity for the development and implementation of effective Tier 1 practices.  McKinna staff will continue to incorporate a 
collaborative 
approach and common la
nguage for teaching students self
-
regulation and peaceful problem solving through "Toolbox Tools," strategies 
for fostering social
-
emotional development in children.

The staff will continue to engage in ongoing professional development and collaboration t
hat strengthens teaching and learning practices 
around math, language and literacy rich instruction across all grade levels throughout the day.  McKinna staff  will focus on
 
strengthening  
teaching and learning  practices that are responsive through data
-
d
riven instruction,  ongoing reflection and collaboration and  
professional development to strengthen teaching and learning practices school wide.   As a community of learners, we  will  f
ocus on high 
leverage, research based instructional practices to incr
ease opportunities for students to communicate thinking and reasoning, with 
differentiated instructional strategies to foster language and literacy development aligned with  Common Core Standards. Teac
hers will 
focus on the 8 math practices as well as math
 
claims within the CAASPP system:  concepts & procedures, problem solving/data analysis, 
and communicating reasoning. Emphasis to reinforce CAASPP claims in literacy development will be centered on a balanced liter
acy 
approach that includes reading, writin
g, listening, speaking across all content areas.  ELD focus includes both designated ELD and 
integrated ELD to support language development and access to rigorous standards across content areas.  Teachers will utilize 
district 
adopted resources, assessment
s & technology to promote high student engagement and achievement, utilizing  data to inform and refine 
instruction.
 
 
Capacity building for data driven instruction & intervention will be fostered through PLCs, including Teaching
-
 
Learning, and Culture
-
Clim
ate Leadership Teams, and Intervention Support Teams. Collaborative opportunities will encourage grade level and cross grade 
level 
articulation to inform & refine teaching & learning practices around  ELA/literacy and math.   Teachers will utilize assessme
nts such as 
STAR360, Performance Task Interim Assessments from the CAASPP system and Curriculum Benchmark assessments in reading, writing
, 
math and ELD to inform instruction. Teachers participate in scheduled grade level Intervention Review Team meetings t
o analyze data 
collected from on
-
going progress
-
monitoring. The data will be used to determine  adjustments to students' instructional programs as 
needed. Release time for grade level teams will be  provided for data review, grade level observations, colla
boration and planning.
 
 
In addition to providing intentional, appropriate academic, social and emotional support for students, McKinna staff will wor
k diligently 
to foster strong partnerships with the McKinna families.  McKinna considers the families the m
ost essential partners in achieving goals 
within the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).  The McKinna staff will cultivate meaningful partnerships and authenti
c family 
engagement though healthy communication venues such as SSC, ELAC and PTA, as wel
l as school events, family education opportunities 
like Family Fridays, math and science nights, as well as forums for families to contribute to the educational opportunities f
or their children. 
A series of parent workshops will be offered through Newcomer
 
Family Support meetings hosted throughout the year at McKinna to 
address specific newcomer parent needs. All families will be offered many opportunities to be involved in their child's schoo
ling to learn 
what can be done to support their child's education
.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent 
with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

McKinna considers the families the most essential partners in achieving our educational program goals. The McKinna staff  cul
tivates meaningful 
partnerships and authentic family engagement though healthy communication venues s
uch as SSC, ELAC and PTA, as well as school events, family 
education opportunities like Family Fridays, math and science nights, as well as forums for families to contribute to the edu
cational opportunities for 
their children. A series of parent workshops 
will be offered through Newcomer Family Support meetings hosted throughout the year at McKinna to 
address specific newcomer parent needs. All families will be offered many opportunities to be involved in their child's schoo
ling to learn what can be 
done to
 
support their child's education.
 
 
In addition, McKinna partners with organizations to provide workshops for families.     Agencies like  Ventura County Behavio
ral Health and Logrando 
Bienestar offer workshops and services to families for mental health.  T
he Newcomer TOSA will work with the EL TOSA to help Newcomer students and 
families connect to these resources and educational opportunities while McKinna's ORC works with the school Social Worker to 
connect the resources 
to families school wide.   Project 
2INSPIRE classes have been offered through District support to increase EL parent engagement, leadership and advocacy.  
In addition, McKinna staff offers opportunities for parents to attend workshops to promote literacy, math, and technology for
 
their chil
dren.
 
 
McKinna School also benefits from an extremely active and involved Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA). The PTA works with the community through 
various school fundraisers, school activities and field trips.
 
 
In addition to being a decision making body
, parents within the SSC and ELAC are welcome to listen to speakers from the district and outside resources 
during designated ELAC, SSC and Title I meetings and special events. Information and resources to promote child safety, child
 
nutrition, and child 
d
evelopment are shared at these venues.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of McKinna School. The McKinna
 
community works collaboratively to foster responsive, restorative 
systems within a Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) framework to create a healthy learning environment where students thrive.  McKinna staff is 
committed to the implementation of a proa
ctive and positive behavior support system (PBIS) school wide.  The PBIS Leadership Team works within the 
Safe & Civil School model through a continuous improvement process to guide the entire staff through the construction and imp
lementation of a 
comprehe
nsive approach to behavior support.  This approach is proactive, positive, and instructional offering an alternative means of
 
correction to 
address student behavior that preserves student attendance and builds student responsibility, self
-
control and civic
 
awareness. The goal of the Safe and 
Civil School model is to reduce all behavioral and motivational barriers to learning by promoting safety and pro
-
social behavior, by supporting both 
academic and social emotional learning, and by enhancing staff consist
ency in teaching positive behavior expectations school wide.  During the 2019
-
20 
school year, the PBIS Leadership Team will receive ongoing training to help build adult capacity for the development and impl
ementation of effective 
Tier 1 practices.  McKinna
 
staff will continue to incorporate a collaborative approach and common language for teaching students self
-
regulation and 
peaceful problem solving through "Toolbox Tools," strategies for fostering social
-
emotional development in children.
 
 
To safeguard th
e well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety Committee, which includ
es 
input by our School Resource Officer.  The Safety Plan is updated annually in the fall; all revisions and updates are rev
iewed immediately with the staff.    
Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on playground supervision, emergency procedures, and the implementation of Toolbox, a s
ocial
-
emotional 
development program that teaches students self
-
regulation, self
-
confidence, re
sponsibility, and stress management, all factors leading to a safe 
environment.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake stan
dards.  Safety drills are held 
regularly; fire dri
lls are held monthly, and earthquake and lock down drills are held each trimester.
 
 
McKinna's campus is closed during hours when students are present. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the office and 

times. Supervision
 
is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch and after school. Supervision is a re
sponsibility 
shared among campus supervisors, teachers and the school administration. We have been able to hire additional campus 
assistants so that we now have 
six 5.5 hour positions and an additional  person at 3.5 hours  who works during lunch.
