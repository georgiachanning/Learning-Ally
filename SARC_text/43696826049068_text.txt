School Description
 
Argonaut 

 
Argonaut Elementary School is a school of inspired and passionate learners. Teachers and students 
are committed to developing relationships and trust in the classroom, leading to a strong culture 
of learnin
g and accomplishment. We believe that students who set goals for learning are given 
incentive and purpose. We embrace the qualities of visible learning in fostering a growth mindset 
of learning from mistakes, receiving and responding to feedback in order t
o reach our fullest 
potential.
 
 
Argonaut's mission is in alignment with our district's: Saratoga Union School District's mission is to 
create an innovative public school system that stimulates intellectual curiosity, providing academic 
rigor for each and e
very learner, and instills leadership, responsibility, and global citizenship in a 
safe and nurturing environment where learners THRIVE. We accomplish this with a highly 
professional and differentiated system of education, which engages the community as ed
ucational 
partners, embraces diversity, inspires creativity, and fosters student well
-
being. We measure 
success in students outcomes and achievement, professional growth, and a commitment to 
continuous improvement.
 
 
School Profile
 
Argonaut Elementary Schoo
l's motto is: "Inspire. Achieve. Learn. Play." A dedicated and 
experienced staff enjoys the challenge of working at Argonaut with its diverse and talented student 
body, involved community members, and commitment to excellence in education. The students 
are
 
bright, inquisitive, playful and creative. Argonaut Elementary is a school that aims for excellence 
in both academics and the arts, and this begins with a culture of community building. We are a 
learning community that celebrates the whole child, where we
 
recognize the potential for creative 
expression and we encourage an appreciation of artistic and musical contributions as much as we 
celebrate the traditional core academic subjects.
 
 
Building positive teacher
-
student relationships is one of the most effe
ctive strategies for student 
learning. Argonaut teachers have developed this as an art form. Argonaut teachers begin building 
positive relationships with their students on the first day of school. They create learning 
environments based on mutual respect a
nd trust where students may experiment and take risks. 
Whenever possible, students choose their own topics to explore and investigate. Thought 
provoking topics and assignments that are purposeful and of high interest assure student 
participation, and there
fore, promotes success. Third grade students wrote persuasive letters to 
the principal to share their desire for a place to build and design their own creations and form a 
robotics team. Their passion and their reasons were enough evidence to make these wi
shes a 
reality. We now have a fully operational Innovation Lab where TK
-
5 students are designing, 
collaborating, and creating in an inspiring space.
 
 
It is in the teacher
-
student relationship where the magic happens. When our students report that 
they feel
 
heard and they feel inspiration and kindness from their teachers and staff members, this 
is where learning takes root. With families and the community as partners, our students' 
imaginations blossom.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report C
ard (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

All instructional materials in the core curriculum in Saratoga Union School 
District are aligned to the California Content Standards and Frameworks. SUSD 
adheres to CA Education Code and AB 1246, which gives school districts freedom, decision making, and choice in selecting inst
ructional materials, and 
requires: implementing the C
alifornia Common Core State Standards; equal access to current curriculum materials; change in the adoption cycle; local 
school districts can choose their own adoption review process; and classroom teachers will be a major contributor in local ad
option pro
cesses.
 
 
SUSD students have access to standards
-
based instructional materials, as per EC Section 60119(c)(1), which states that sufficient textbooks or 
instructional materials mean, "each pupil, including English Learners, has a standards
-

or instructional materials, or both, to use in class 
and to take home. This paragraph does not require two sets of textbooks or instructional materials for each pupil." This spec
ifically applies to four subject 
areas: reading/language arts, mathematics, sc
ience, and history
-
social science.

School Facility Conditions and Plann
ed Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities mainten
ance and campus supervision. 
Argonaut Elementary School's original facilities were built in 1959
; ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in 
good condition are co
mpleted in a timely manner. A work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Various improvements are needed throughout the year as identified.  Th
e exterior of the school was repainted in the summer of 2019. Annual inspections 
and tests were completed for the fire alarm/sprinkler/hydrant, fire extinguishers, post indicator valve and backflow, elevato
r and stage lifts, kitchen 
hoods and fire systems,
 
bathroom hardware, and preventative maintenance on sewers.  Weed abatement and pest control is monitored and performed.  
Every room receives deep cleaning in the summer. Preventative maintenance is performed on all HVAC units. Playgrounds are ins
pected an
nually and 
any necessary repairs are completed and new sand is applied.
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need at
tention prior to students and 
staff entering school ground
s. One day custodian and one evening custodian are assigned to Argonaut Elementary School. The day custodian is 
responsible for general grounds maintenance, cleaning the restrooms, multi
-
purpose room, trash removal, and preparing the school for opening. Th
e  
evening custodian responsible for cleaning the classrooms and trash removal.
 
 
The principal communicates with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

ill Sena
te Bill 187 
requirements. The CSSPs were approved by the district's board of trustees before March 1st.  Components of this plan include 
information assessing the 
current status of school crime committed on school campus and at school

sponse procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment 
policy, and dress code policy.
 
 
The school's most recent school safety plan was reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff annually at the beginning 
of the 
school year. The 
most current copy of the school plan is available in the school office for public review. For additional information on schoo
l safety programs, policies, 
procedures, and how you may become involved, please contact the school principal.

m framework to align professional 
development and curriculum implementation.
 
 
Saratoga Union School District sponsors three days of professional staff development during the course of the school year. Di
strict and site leaders and 
teacher leaders work with
 
staff members to analyze student data, make curricular adjustments based upon student need, and learn and incorporate new 
and innovative strategies to support student achievement. Teachers also work with one another during structured collaboration
 
periods
 
during the school 
week. This collaborative work is instrumental in maintaining the consistency of curriculum design and sharing best practices 
with one another. Ongoing 
professional development is a high priority for all SUSD teachers and classified staff
.  In addition, our teachers and other staff are encouraged, and take 
advantage of, extensive training opportunities within the district and on their own. Our Innovative Learning Team, comprised
