About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Alvord Alternative High School was built in 2012.  The school has 12 portable classroom
s, four sets of restrooms, four computer labs, and one library.  
On
-
going campus improvements and maintenance ensure facilities are up to date and provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Alvord Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure 
that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC.  Results of this survey are available in the school office or at
 
the district.  In additi
on, district 
maintenance staff makes repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order. A district
-
wide work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and to prioritize repairs.
