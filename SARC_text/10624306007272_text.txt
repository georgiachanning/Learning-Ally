By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School 
Description: Washington Elementary is one of Selma Unified School District's (SUSD's) oldest elementary schools. 
It is located in the southwestern part of Selma, California, approximately 19 miles south of Fresno. It is surrounded by 
agriculture, which is 
the primary industry for the majority of our community members. Selma is a small, close
-
knit 
community with a great sense of pride.  Washington Elementary serves students who are in kindergarten and first
-
grade. 
Our students then progress to Eric White Ele
mentary School for second through sixth grade. They continue on to Abraham 
Lincoln Middle School and then to Selma High School.
 
 
Washington Elementary School uses the Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) framework where the integration of 
evidence
-
based 
instruction, interventions, and assessments is used to address the full range of student academic, 
behavioral and emotional needs.  We utilize the Cycle of Continuous Improvement to reflect and refine our instruction.  
In addition, grade
-
level teams meet f
or Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) on a weekly basis.  The work completed 
during these PLCs ensure consistency within our grade
-
level teams and helps teachers reflect on student achievement as 
a team.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Washington 
Elementary highly encourages community and parental involvement. A number of outreach programs have 
been designed to meet the needs of a variety of student groups and their families. Washington has a very active English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) co
mprised of parents who are elected annually. ELAC representatives offer ideas and 

representatives on DELAC, which is the District English Lear
ner Advisory Committee. In addition, we have a School Site 
Council (SSC) that meets at least four times a year. The SSC meetings provide an opportunity for parents to give input on 
current initiatives, receive training, collaborate with the school site, he
lp with decision
-
making, and work towards a 
common vision.
 
 
For the 2019
-
2020 school year, the school site partnered with Valley PBS Education Services to provide Ready to Learn 
Workshops for parents. The Valley PBS Education Services team believes all parents are capable of stepping confidently 
into the role of be
ing their child's first teacher. It is their goal to provide parents and caretakers with the background 
knowledge, techniques, resources and encouragement needed to fulfill this ever
-
important role. The classes that were 
offered included Positive Disciplin
e, Vocabulary Development, and Prepositions. In addition, two sessions of Parent 
Technology Training were provided. The training was facilitated by our Teacher Librarian and included topics on Computer 
Use, Word Processing, Homework Help, and Digital Citiz
enship. 
 
 
In addition to the parent training, teachers recruit parent and community volunteers to assist in the classroom, on field 
trips, and during special events. Parents and community members are encouraged to be involved through flyers, 
calendars, new
sletters, marquee announcements, automated calls, and personal invitations via written correspondence 
and phone calls.
 
 
Washington School staff and administration partner with many community agencies and outside resources to ensure that 
we are able to meet
 
the needs of all students. These partnerships include both on
-
site and off
-
site services and referral 
services.
 
 
Listed below are many of the opportunities for parent involvement:

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

challenges, as well as a comprehensive approach to early identification of all warning signs that might lead to violence 
towards self or others. All staff, parents, and members of the community must be part of creating a safe school plan.
 
 
The basic compon
ents of our Safe School Plan include: a crisis management plan which involves all school, district, and 
emergency personnel; student involvement; parent participation; a partnership between the school and local law 
enforcement; crime prevention through env
ironmental design; drug and alcohol prevention programs; a school crime 
reporting and tracking mechanism; school security; training for school personnel; and a concise discipline code for all 
students. The Safety Plan is revised and updated annually with t
he input of administration, teachers, law enforcement, 
students, and parents. The 2019
-
2020 School Safety Plan was updated and reviewed on February 2019.
 
 
To ensure student safety, staff supervises students at all times: before and after school, during rec
ess, lunchtime, and 
during dismissal time. Any visitors to the campus are required to check
-
in at the school office and must wear the proper 
identification badge at all times.
 
 
The Selma Unified School District has established an Emergency Procedure Guide 
which gives specific instructions to follow 
in the event of an emergency. These responses have been standardized for every school site and business facility in the 
district. All Selma Unified School District employees must familiarize themselves with these
 
emergency procedures. The 
Emergency Procedure Guide is posted in every classroom and office next to the telephone, and an evacuation map is 
updated as needed throughout the year.
 
 
A log of all practice emergency drills is kept with dates and times 
documented. Bus evacuations occur once a year. In 
addition, fire extinguishers are checked monthly by the school custodian. The monthly checks are documented on the fire 
extinguisher tag.
 
 
Selma Unified utilizes SPRIGEO at every school site. SPRIGEO is an 
electronic platform that gives students and their parents 
the tool to report bullying and other safety concerns anonymously through a link on the school website. All students 
should feel safe at school and in their community. This program will empower chil
dren to speak out and make a change. 
Statistics show that nearly 75% of students experience bullying on a daily basis, and about 65% of bullying incidents go 
unreported. 160,000 kids in America skip school on a daily basis because they don't feel safe. SPR
IGEO notifies 
administrators through emails and texts to alert them of reported incidents. This program also stores the incident report 
in a secure online database, which provides school organizations with an efficient method of tracking and analyzing 
repo
rts.

Accountability Plan). Priority will be given to increasing student achievement; increasing student engagement; promoting 
a positive school climate and safe 
environment; maintaining highly qualified teachers with a focus on continued 
professional growth; implementation of Common Core State Standards; course access and access to a broad curriculum; 
parental involvement and other student outcomes.
 
 
The most impo
rtant asset we have to support student learning is that of our highly
-
qualified and credentialed teachers. 
They implement the core curriculum and use research
-
based and proven effective supplemental resources to address the 
needs of the students. In additi
on, services funded include district coaches, as well as independent consultants, both of 
whom are available to sites to provide training and support for teachers on best teaching practices. Planning days, staff 
development and grade level Professional Lea
rning Communities (PLCs) offer teachers the opportunity to discuss and 
share best teaching practices with their peers.
 
 
Special Education services include a Resource Specialist Program teacher, an elementary Speech and Language 
Pathologist, and a School Ps
ychologist. One intervention teacher provides Tier 2 intervention services for students in grade 
1, using developmentally appropriate materials to teach students how to read and comprehend. The Resources Specialist 
Program teacher also provides Tier 2/3 in
tervention to our students in Kindergarten and 1st grade. Site Title 1 funding is 
used to pay for 80% of the Resource Specialist to provide Tier 2/3 intervention.
 
 
Washington Elementary provides an After

assistance and 
intervention to students who need additional academic support. During the After
-
School program, homework time is built 
in to help students. In addition, there is an enrichment component in the program where students participate in organized 
outdoor activities, cooking, arts and crafts, and dance.

Selma Unified School District supports and builds teacher capacity throughout the year through a Site Based Coaching 
model.  This model allows for job embedded Professional learning by implementing the tenets of the Professional Learning 
Community framewor
k. The district maintains a ELA/ELD, Math and Science coaching team that in turn support and 
provide instructional support for our site level coaching team. In collaboration with both teams, professional learning for 
teachers is provided to assist all stud
ents in achieving the State academic standards, with an emphasis on addressing and 
supporting student groups requiring additional resources; groups such as Foster Youth, English Learners, and 
Students 
with Disabilities.
 
 
The District also provides all teac
hers with three professional learning days throughout the year.  These are non
-
student 
days that are planned and facilitated by site leaders and site coaches.  For the last couple of years, these days focus on 
allowing teachers time for instructional plann
ing as they apply to the California Standards for the Teacher Profession 
(CSTPs 3, 4, & 5).

Professional Development
 
 
At Washington, all planned staff development is based upon needs assessments that are conducted at least once a year. 
All staff dev
elopment opportunities address areas of concern and needed improvement based on student achievement 
data. With the use of Illuminate, the analysis of trimester reports offers evidence as to which standards students are 
struggling, as well as information on
 
which standards students have been able to master. If teachers need additional 
assistance with teaching a specific content area, they are offered opportunities to observe other teachers within the 
district, they may receive support from content experts or
 
academic coaches, or they may be encouraged to attend specific 
training and/or workshops to help address the concern.
 
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, the school site has provided various in
-
house professional learning which includes: 
Benchmark Advance 
Reading Curriculum overview and curriculum mapping, ELD coaching with a focus on EL instructional 
goals, text
-
dependent questions, use of graphic organizers and productive partnering.  In addition, our RSP/Intervention 
Teacher attended the Linda
-
mood Bell 
Visualizing and Verbalizing Workshop.  In addition, our last classroom teacher that 
needed the Orton Gillingham Training attended the training.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, the school site has provided professional development training that includes:
 
Daily 5 
training for all classroom teachers.  This training was provided in response to the focus on literacy.  Our data showed that 
students needed additional support to become more fluent readers and build a strong reading foundation.
 
 
During the 2019
-
2
020 school year, the school site has provided professional development training with "Who's Doing the 
Work? How to Say Less so Readers can do More".  This training was provided in response/continuation to the work the 
school site had previously identified 
as an area of growth.  This training helped teachers look at their instruction to find 
places where they are doing the work for students, creating dependency, and interfering with student growth.  The 
instructional coach followed up the training with in
-
cl
ass coaching and additional professional learning sessions 
throughout the school year.

In addition to the above listed professional development opportunities, grade levels are provided with data 
review/planning release days. During these release days, tea
chers have the opportunity to meet as a grade level to discuss 
teaching, lesson plans, and curriculum guides. They also review supplemental materials and analyze student work and 
assessments, as well as discuss the student progress towards the school
-
wide 
goals. During this time, teachers work with 
the intervention staff to ensure we are providing Tier 2 and 3 interventions to the right students. We also use this time to 
discuss growth or lack of growth with students who have been receiving Tier 2 and 3 int
erventions.
 
 
All Tuesdays are District
-
designated early release days for the purpose of providing release time for teachers to participate 
in school or district
-
level professional development sessions. Site
-
level professional development is conducted by si
te and 
district administrators, as well as teachers. All staff development opportunities provide a means for collaboration within, 
and between, grade levels.
 
 
In addition, our school site offers one hour a week of uninterrupted PLC time by grade level 
teams.  This time is used for 
curriculum planning and reviewing common formative assessments to guide lessons to support individual student 
learning.
