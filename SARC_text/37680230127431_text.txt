About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a S
chool Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loca
l Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with d
ata reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or th
e 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff participate in District professional development opportunities in the areas of Math, Language Arts and the implementati
on of Common Core State 
Standards. In addition to our classroom teachers, Camarena employs six part
-
time program support teachers t
o enhance the educational program. These 
teachers provide instruction in the areas of visual arts, dance, music, and digital photography. While these teachers are pro
viding instruction in these 
areas, classroom teachers are given the opportunity to collabo
rate and review instructional practices, as well as receive professional development in 
identified areas of need.

-
19 professional development focused on guided instruction.  Student performance data as well as weekly classroom observations

-
6.  Teachers used a variety of strategies 
to support s
tudent opportunities for learning by holding academic conversations.  Strategies and Techniques included discussion cards, ch
ecklists, and 
discussion rubrics.  Teachers created writing prompts each quarter to check for student understanding of content, voc
abulary and writing techniques.  
Teachers reviewed math data during collaborations each week and identified which students were not averaging 85% or more on t
he assessment given 
each quarter.  This supported teachers in identifying and re
-
teaching math con
cepts, procedures and skills students had not learned with mastery.
 
 
Professional development (PD) delivery:  PD has been provided via a variety of methods including, but not limited to:
 

 
on site staff meetings;
 

 
reciprocal teacher observation;
 

 
professional 
texts and readings;
 

 
professional development provided by the district;
 

 
resource teacher modeled and/or coached, as needed through January 2019, when she was promoted to a position at the district 
office; and,
 

 
feedback and modeling provided by 
administration
 
 
Teacher support during implementation:
 

 
Teachers are encouraged to implement these new instructional strategies and observed through the lens of safe practice.
 

 
Teachers receive instructional feedback via regular walkthroughs or regularly sch
eduled observations by administration, and are encouraged 
not only to consider next steps but to share their findings within their grade levels and system
-
wide.
 

 
Biweekly observation findings are shared during professional development meetings and in grade
-
level collaboration.
 

 
Quarterly student monitoring, regular observations of student learning and teacher practice are discussed with each teacher w
here we share 
strategies and next steps for instructional plans for growth for each child.
 

 
A compilation of st
udent progress is shared regularly with staff for consideration of adjustments in their practice.
 

 
Quarterly instructional conferences are held with teachers to discuss instructional suggestions/strategies and techniques and
 
open up to 
questions or feedback
 
they may seek.

Types of Services Funded
 
Professional Development as a school has focused on High Impact Language Strategies and Collaborative Discussions.  Teachers 
use the research of John 
Hattie to determine the strategies that yield the greatest gains for students' academic performance.  Teac
hers collaborate once a week to design 
standards
-
aligned lessons that incorporate these strategies and student progress is monitored at the end of each quarter.
 
 
In classrooms, teachers provide small group, guided instruction and interventions that are imp
lemented for students identified as at risk (SST process).  
Jumpstart and Extended Day reading and math programs are available after school for at risk students, based on eligibility as
 
determined by the district.  
English learners receive 30 minutes of de
signated instruction in English on a daily basis. Though GATE is not a required expenditure, students receive 
enrichment within the school day and in after school programs.  In school GATE instructional strategies and activities includ
e but are not limited
 
to: 
Literature Circles, Book Clubs, Stretch Articles, and Choice Menus.  After school GATE programs may include but are not limit
ed to Robotics.
 
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
http
s://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollm
ent, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first

served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availab
ility), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
