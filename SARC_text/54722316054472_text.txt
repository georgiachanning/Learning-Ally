School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Kohn Elementary School serves approximately 640 students in the transitional kindergarten 
through sixth grades. In addition to our strong academic focus, our school is characterized by a 
hands
-
on philosophy of learning that is designed to inspire curiosity
, enthusiasm, and self
-
motivation in each of our students. Our talented teaching staff works hard to ensure that each child 
achieves his or her fullest potential. We believe that the children of Kohn Elementary School are 
given the necessary tools to becom
e positive, responsible, and productive citizens in the future.
 
 
The focus of Kohn School's professional development program is to support our efforts to improve 
student achievement school
-
wide and for students of significant subgroups. Each year, the 
prof
essional development program is planned for Wednesday early
-
release days. The professional 
development program is based on information gathered from student assessment data and from 
teachers, parents, and student perceptual data. This information is the fo
undation for the school 
needs assessments, which is the basis of the school
-
wide plan. The needs assessment data, supplied 
in the school
-
wide plan, confirm the type of professional development programs/activities 
provided to teachers that will have positiv
e outcomes on student achievement.
 
 
The parental involvement program at Kohn School is one of the most effective parent involvement 
programs within our district. The school website for Kohn has been designed to help keep parents 
and the community informed 
about all the events that are happening throughout the year. Kohn 
School recognizes character and achievement of students during a positive recognition assembly, 
with parents invited on a monthly basis. The School Site Council/ELAC Local Review enables par
ents 
to visit classrooms and view the curriculum, materials, and student activities referenced within the 
school
-
wide plan.
 
 
Our Mission Statement is as follows:  The Frank Kohn Elementary staff is committed to excellence 
in education, and our mission is t
o provide each student an opportunity to reach his/her full 
potential

academically, ethically, emotionally, physically, and socially.
 
 
In addition to our school's Mission Statement, we also operate with our District's Mission 
Statement in mind:  It require
s all of us to move beyond our own personal and professional biases,
 
To work collectively as a team that is committed to achieving the common expectation.
 
It is a purpose greater than oneself.
 
 
"Raising Up a Community of Caring, Creative, and Confident Chi

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school has a Safe School Plan that is in place and updated yearly by the School Safety Committee, an offshoot of the Scho
ol 
Site Council. Evacuation 
drills are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that staff and students know what to do in an emergency. A Cal
-
OSHA representative attends monthly 
meetings and provides updates to staff on safety and health issues. In addition to
 
these programs, adequate supervision is provided before school, during 

 
 
All school district facilities are supportive of teaching and learning. Classrooms are clean and 
orderly, and provide a safe learning environment reflective 
of student work and current curriculum. Our school cafeteria provides students with a breakfast and lunch program, and is use
d as a multipurpose facility 
for large
-
scale programs and meetings. Our
 
school library provides students with supplemental reading materials and provides additional educational 
resources. The school grounds are kept clean and well maintained for student play, recreation, and athletic activities.
 
 
We take pride in our well
-
mai
ntained buildings and landscaping. The Tulare City School District employs skilled professionals to ensure a safe and clean 
environment throughout the school year. Students, staff, and parents are committed to keeping our campus clean and litter fre
e.
 
 
The
 
Tulare City School District provides ongoing maintenance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and portable buildi
ngs to guarantee all 
schools in the district are in good working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for
 
pupils are maintained so that they are functional 
and meet local hygiene standards generally applicable to public facilities, including operational toilets and sinks in all re
strooms. The district has 
established a facilities inspection system to ensure t
hat all school buildings meet the standards listed above.
 
 
The school grounds, buildings, and restrooms are kept clean, safe, and regularly maintained. Kohn has a morning custodian fro
m 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. 
and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:0
0 P.M. Custodians are regularly monitored and evaluated by the building principal and a director of 
custodians to make sure that all schools are safely maintained and cleaned. In addition to the assigned school custodians, th
e district has a general 
mainte
nance crew that takes care of the more technical repairs (plumbing, heating, cooling, gas, electrical, carpeting, painting, m
ajor repairs, and so on). 
At times, the district will hire an independent contractor to handle repairs that may be beyond the scope
 

an ongoing basis. The district has a work order repair procedure that begins with the school principal referring needed repai
rs that cannot be taken care 
of by the site custodians to the district superinten
dent. The superintendent assigns the repairs to the maintenance director who, in turn, assigns the 
work out to the different maintenance specialists. Work orders are completed on a timely basis. Each school also has a school
 
site safety representative 
who 

asis with the district 
superintendent to discuss questions or concerns.
 
 
Kohn School opened in the fall of 1962. It had a complete 
modernization of all permanent structures in 2003. The buildings and grounds are well kept, 
safe, and present a positive atmosphere for students to grow socially and academically. There are two wings consisting of eig
ht adjoining classrooms 
each and one wi
ng that has six classrooms and a library in the center. The school has approximately 47,500 square feet of indoor educational
 
space. The 
library has approximately 19,230 books with 11,515 different titles. We have eight student computers with full Internet
 
and educational programs and a 
teacher workstation for the librarian. We also have six portable structures that, for all intents and purposes, are permanent
. All structures are handicap 
friendly. All classroom and administration facilities have new carpet
, double pane windows, shelving, white boards, and lighting, and are equipped with 
computer and Internet hook ups.

School Safety Plan
 
We have developed and implemented a Comprehensive School Safety Plan and a Crisis Management Plan, covering all possible disa
ster scenarios. Our 
scho
ol personnel, parents, and community annually review and update these plans for effectiveness. Our School Safety Committee re
vised and updated 
our School Safety Plan in the spring of every year. Students and staff also participate in monthly fire drills, p
eriodic earthquake drills, crisis emergency 
drills and an annual bus evacuation drill.
