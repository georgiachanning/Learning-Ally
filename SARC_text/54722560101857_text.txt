By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Oak Grove Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Sufficient
 
space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the 
State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.
 
 
Mainten
ance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
giv
en the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with ad
ministrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assi
st school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The 
deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
During the summer of 2008 a DSA approved shade structure was built in the 
center courtyard.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved Level 3

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Oak Grove Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school grounds before, 
during, and after school. Entrances to school grounds are secured or 
monitored during the school day. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on 
campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist i
n maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. 
The safety plan is reviewed annually, reviewed 
with the staff, updated as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to 
the public at the school office.  It was reviewed with our staff and updated in Septem
ber 2019, and reviewed by our School 
Site Council in October 2019.

The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff:  professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and 
literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by school data.  Our district provides professional 
development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at th
e district, school and classroom level dependent on teacher goals.  The district 
provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for New Teachers:  Du


challenge and in compliance with the Californ
ia Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning sy
stem begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. 
In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individ
ualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on less
on design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided 
time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary
 
credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance al
so have access to one
