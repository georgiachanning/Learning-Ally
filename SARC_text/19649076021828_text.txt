Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the district are 
in compliance with all laws, rules 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. All buildings within the district are in 
compliance with state earthquake standards. A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes policies on disaster 
preparedness, student discipline, the componen
ts of a safe and orderly school environment, suspension/expulsion 
procedures, safety, child abuse reporting procedures, student dress codes, and student and staff sexual harassment. All 
teachers are provided this plan at the beginning of the year in the St
aff Handbook.  School Site Council and staff review 
and revise the Safe School Plan on a yearly basis.
 
 
Students on campus are supervised for thirty minutes before and after school. Visitors to the campus must register at the 
administrative office before e
ntering the campus and the Raptor Visitor Management system is used to scan ID for visitors 

 
 
As we continue to implement Positive Behavior Intervention Support (P
BIS), the staff reminds all students about our 
Behavior Statement: "Diamond Point is a learning community committed to providing a safe, respectful, and positive 
environment for academic and social success for all." We continue to identify school
-
 
wide beh
avioral expectations: I am 
responsible and persevere, I am respectful and kind, I am safe, and I shine. A behavior matrix was developed to explicitly 
teach the expected behavior for various settings around campus
--
in the classroom, library, cafeteria, rest
rooms, 
playground, and computer lab. Students are rewarded with "Shine tickets" when staff observes students demonstrating 
the expected behaviors. Our PBIS team is comprised of teachers and support staff who have attended numerous hours of 
training, meet f
requently to assess progress of our PBIS system, conduct professional development for staff, and identify 
students who are in need of the next tier of PBIS support.
