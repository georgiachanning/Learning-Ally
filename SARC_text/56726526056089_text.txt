Elementary School is a welcoming, 
stimulating environment where students are 
actively involved in learning academics as 
well as positive values. Through our hard 
work, we will challenge our students to reach 
their maximum potential. 
We encourage you to: 
Read to your child - It is a great way to 
expand their vocabulary, model the love of 
reading and spend quality time together. 
Make attendance a priority - When students 
are absent from school, for any reason, they 
are missing learning opportunities. 
Get involved - Join the PSFO, become a 
School Site Council member, represent 
Elmhurst at monthly PAC meetings with the 
superintendent, volunteer in the classroom or 
library, help at recess, or assist in organizing 
a school event.

important role in the school. Understanding 
the school™s educational program, student
