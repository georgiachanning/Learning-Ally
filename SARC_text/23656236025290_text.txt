Brookside Elementary School's Mission:
 
 
The staff and administration at Brookside School are committed to the mission of providing a 
quality educational program that enhances all our students' sense of worth with appropriate social 
and academic curricula.
 
 
School Vision Statement
 
 
The Brookside 
community works towards creating a school in which:
 

 
Teachers and parents work together to promote healthy practices that enhance 
children's learning through the creation of a respectful, responsible, collaborative 
community.
 

 
Classroom environments promote 
trust, respect, and tolerance. Children learn 
efficiently and feel safe and secure as learners.
 

 
There is a commitment to high academic standards and increasing independence by 
respecting all students' needs, abilities, competencies, and interests. Use of 
a
ssessments such as DIBELs for Reading and Math guide teaching, enhance learning 
and inform students and parents of individual achievement. The assessments inform 
teachers, administrators, and the community of school
-
wide progress.
 

 
Faculty members 
regularly communicate and share ideas. As a team, we respect 
differences, voice concerns, and communicate openly in a safe, collaborative 
environment.
 

 
There is a comprehensive plan for staff development that recognizes our interests and 
needs. Staff develo
pment is a process that takes time and includes regular 
collaboration, practice, and is assessment based.
 
 
The Brookside Elementary School Mission and Vision statements were developed collaboratively 
by the Brookside staff.

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Brookside School is in good repair for a school sixty plus years old. There are signs of wear and tear, but overall the schoo
l is maintained. The custodians 
and maintenance crew inspect all playground equipment, fire ext
inguishers and all other safety related equipment. The site includes 26 classrooms of 
which 19 are used for rostered classrooms. There are two sets of student bathrooms and two other bathrooms available that can
 
accommodate special 
needs.  Additionally, 2 
kindergarten classrooms and the full day special education classroom include bathrooms. A section of older portables are used
 
for 
storage, the library, book room and staff room.  The site also houses the State Pre
-
School. Head Start buildings are located o
n the Brookside campus. 
Fencing and gates were added to the west part of the site to improve safety.  New windows were installed in the cafeteria to 
replace the original wooden 
single pane set. We are working diligently to keep our aging building in the be
st possible condition, including repairing newly identified leaks in roof.

effective repairs. The campus needs new 
roofing, including the covered walkways 
between wings. All of the original wing 
flooring is well encapsulated and the 
classrooms were freshly painted. Much of 
the flooring has been d

should be replaced. Until then, 
maintenance is doing a good job of

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides t
he following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental 
Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The Willits community is very supportive of our schools. Parents have multiple opportunities to be involved at Brookside. The
re is an ambitious Parent 
Teacher Organization (PTO) whose primary purpose is to provide support 
and enrichment to the students and staff of Brookside Elementary. The PTO 
sponsors a Book Give Away to every student at the school four times per year. Additionally, the PTO provides materials for st
udents and classrooms, a 
reading incentive program, fundi
ng for assemblies, and addresses other needs that arise. PTO parents join with teachers to create and lead events such 
as Spooky Story Night, Parent Coffees on the Playground with Principal, and Family Game Night.  The school also participates 
in the Foste
r Grandparent 
program and welcomes a variety of other volunteers such as high school students who volunteer as part of their school program
.
 
 
Classroom teachers, office personnel, and other staff members, as well as PTO officers, can help any parent become
 
more involved with Brookside School.  
Families are encouraged to attend Back to School Night, Open House, Spooky Story Night, the costume parade, our Color Run, In
ternational Walk to 
School Day, and Family Game Nights/Book Exchanges. In addition to the an
nual Kindergarten Graduation, First Grade Sing, Second Grade Winter Program, 
and school
-
wide Talent Show, many classrooms invite families throughout the year to student presentations. Parents and family members ar
e 
encouraged by teachers to volunteer in cl
assrooms. Our PTO reimburses families for the costs of required fingerprinting so family members can volunteer. 
We have fingerprinting services available at Back to School Night.
 
 
Family and community members are an integral part of the School Site Council
 
which takes an active role in helping to provide direction and support for 
Brookside School.  The School Site Council also reviews the district LCAP and provides input into this plan. Reviewing and mo
nitoring the site's Safety 
Plan and 
School Plan
 
for Stu
dent Achievement are also important roles of this Council.
 
 
Teachers, PTO officers, and school administrators communicate with families regularly through newsletters, notices, automated
 
messages home, the 
school and district websites and Facebook pages, an
d articles in our local newspapers.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed and revised yearly by staff, the School Safety Committee, our Parent Teacher Organization 
and the Site Council. The 
Safety Plan was revised in November 2019, a
nd there is a complete Safety plan on file at the District Office and at the Site. The well
-
being and safety of 
our students is our priority. Adult supervision is provided at all times while school is in session. Visitors to the campus a
re required to sign
 
in at the office 
and obtain a visitor's pass. A system is in place for classroom and playground emergency assistance. Safety drills, including
 
monthly fire drills, three lock
-
down drills, and an earthquake drill are conducted each year.  Teams have been d
eveloped as part of the emergency plan to ensure that there would be 
staff assigned to stay with students and others assigned to help with the various tasks required during an emergency.
 
 
A site health aide is on
-
hand during school hours to provide 
first aid, administer prescribed medications, oversee required vaccinations, and organize 
health screenings. A licensed  R.N. is available for consultation to coordinate special health needs of our students and othe
rs in the District. Playground 
equipment 
is checked to ensure safety. Behavioral expectations are taught and reviewed with students on a regular basis as part of our 
Building Effective 
Schools Together practices (BEST). Behavior standards for all areas of our school are explained and students are
 
taught the expected behaviors. During 
2013
-
2014, the district began implementation of the Elementary School Counseling grant which provided some intervention and counse
ling for students 
who need additional assistance.  This grant continued in 2014
-
2015, 2
015
-
2016, and 2016
-
2017, and included social skills groups, individual counseling, 
and family support services. Our school and district have continued to offer most of these services after the expiration of t
he grant.

Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Here you'll see how we 
used the time this site set aside for the past three
-
plus years for their continuing education and professi
onal development. In 19/20 we had four days set 
aside by the district for professional growth. Those full days do not include the opportunities used after school on early re
lease days.
 
 
Our professional development for 2019
-
20 revolves around year 2 of our
 
3
-
year SUMS/MTSS Grant, which we received last year from the State of 
California. The grant supports our work in implementing academic Response to Intervention (RtI), Positive Behavioral Interven
tions and Supports (PBIS), 
and social emotional learning and
 
support because our school
-
wide data indicated these are areas of needed growth. Based on the results of assessment, 
including DIBELS/Acadiance Reading, our TK
-
5 teachers and para
-
educators utilize instructional strategies for phonemic awareness and phoni
cs (Tiers 1
-
2), delivered by Trish Martin of Rewiring the Brain/Unlocking the Code. The training is continuing in webinar fashion through
out the school year. Up to 
four sessions of training are in the service of honing teacher and para
-
educator skills in p
resenting phonemic awareness and phonics, to build a strong 
foundation for learning to read. This year, Grammar instruction has been added to the professional development. Our counselor
 
continues to train staff 
in social/emotional learning and positive dis
cipline, during staff meetings and during after school pop
-
up type meetings. She also trains teachers and 
students as she delivers lessons in the classroom. Additional professional growth for teachers and para
-
educators is provided as requested. For exampl
e, 
some staff members asked for training on de
-
escalation techniques so our district special education director provided two after school trainings for all 
interested staff members and staff were paid to stay late and join the training. Para
-
educators are 
an important part of our instructional team and are 
always paid to stay late and attend all PD.
 
 
Our professional growth up to this year is varied and focused on E/LA, Math and behavior support. Our 2017/2018 school year p
lan, included refining 
our use of 
the program components of Benchmark Reading, and learning to use our newly adopted math curriculum, Everyday Math. We receive
d a full 
day publisher training in person from Everyday Math, and a half day publisher training by Benchmark E/LA via webinar befor
e school began. During staff 
meetings we have used teacher experts to train teachers and para
-
educators on techniques to support our instruction in reading and math. A curriculum 
expert from our County Office of Education trained teachers on differentiatio
n of instruction to meet the needs of all learners. From 2011 to 2020, PLC 
teams met two to five times per month for forty minutes to review student performance data and analyze student achievement, d
iscuss instructional 
practices and strategies 
-
 
based on
 
student data, and develop pacing guides and assessments.  During some early release days, staff share training they 
have received or areas of expertise, e.g., Handwriting Without Tears, phonemic awareness, etc. Additionally, presentations by
 
Mendocino Cou
nty Office 
of Education have taken place on early release days. Topics included strategies for English Language Learners, collaborative 
work, differentiated 
instruction, and rigor in the Common Core Standards: Math and Reading. During the last nine years, 
Brookside has continued to have a resident musician 
work with teachers and students for 3
-
5 days. During the Spring of 2019, a group of teachers and administrators, K
-
5, went to visit a district implementing 
Unlocking the Reading Code. We saw the benefits 
of the program and came back and shared the information with staff. During the Summer of 2019, a 
group of staff and administrators, K
-
5, went to Acadience (formerly DIBELS) training to learn to better align our instruction with the results of assessment. 
T
hese staff members came back and shared the information with other staff.
