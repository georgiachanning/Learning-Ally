By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the 
California Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials 
approved for u

selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent 
examination at the district office prior to a
doption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Dairyland Elementary School was originally constructed in 1915 and is comprised of nine classrooms, multipurpose room, 
library, staff lounge, and a playground. F
acility and inspection information is current as of December 2019.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
 
The Director of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school. The distr
ict governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
district. A summary of these standards are available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to kee
p the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority are given to 
emergency repairs. At the time of publication 100% of restrooms were in working conditi
on.
 
 
The table shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection. While reviewing this report, please note that 
even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. There are no major deficiencies at this site.

com
ponents. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.
