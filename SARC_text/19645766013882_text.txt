Principal's Message
 
 
La Fetra
 
Elementary School is the largest of five elementary schools in the prestigious Glendora 
Unified School District.  We take pride in the high standards for teaching and learning that have 
been established by our highly effective instructional and support st
aff.  Our goal is for every 
student to experience academic and social growth within a nurturing school environment.
 
 
At La Fetra School, we value teamwork and work collaboratively with students, staff and families 
to support students in reaching academic g
oals.  We are fortunate to have the outstanding support 
of our PTA and the La Fetra School Foundation.  Our PTA and Foundation support our educational 
goals through volunteerism, fundraising for field trips and educational assemblies, upgrading and 
maintai
ning our technology needs, and in the planning of special events and activities.  PTA and 
Foundation membership and support are vital to the continued success of our school.
 
 
We believe that all students can experience success in school and we are dedicate
d to providing 
optimal learning opportunities for every child.  Student recognition assemblies are integrated into 
our curriculum as a way of celebrating student academic success and fostering positive character 
development and school pride.  As we focus o
n 21st Century Learning and dive deeper into the 
implementation of California State Standards, we continue to strive towards meeting and 
exceeding content area standards, while emphasizing the importance of strong character traits, like 
perseverance, respo
nsibility and integrity. We are proud to begin our third year of AVID Elementary 
implementation in all second through fifth grade classrooms, with the goal of adding essential 
components as well as additional grade levels in the coming years. We are also e
xcited to begin our 
second year of implementation of PBIS
-
 
Positive Behavior Intervention Supports in the upcoming 
school year to provide uniform, systematic behavior support systems across grade levels to better 
meet the socio
-
emotional needs of our stude
nts. La Fetra Elementary School is known for its 
dedicated staff and academic excellence. We are always seeking out ways to improve programs 
and services offered to students and families.
 
 
We are committed to preparing our students for college and careers 
by focusing on the essential 
skills 
-
 
communication, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and character development.  We 
have included pertinent information about La Fetra School that we hope you will find useful.  If 
there is anything our team ca
n do to support your child in his/her educational experience, please 
do not hesitate to contact us at (626) 852

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the
