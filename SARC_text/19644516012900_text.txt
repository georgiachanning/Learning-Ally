About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas a
re in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Deta
iled cleaning is done during vacation periods. The District provides maintenance services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are pr
oactive and conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The District administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable learning env
ironment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working or
der. Daily reports of incidents that require repair at the school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service
.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building compone
nts. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, 

rred maintenance plan is available 
at the district office.
 
 
To determine the condit
ion of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the 
Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest
 
is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print 
documents.

School Safety Plan
 

 
ensuring student and staff 
safety during a
 
disaster. Monthly fire drills and disaster drop drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. A storage
 
bin contains 
food, water, and other supplies for use during a disaster.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus. All visitors are required
 
to sign
-

other campus supervisors monitor activity and ensure student safety.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is reviewed annually, was developed by the 
school staff to provide students and staff a means to ensure a 
safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan include: child abuse reporting proc
edures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils procedures, disaste
r response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment 
policy, suspension and expulsion policies, dress code, and discipline policies. The school safety committee and district pers
onnel evaluate the plan 
annually an
d update the plan as needed. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan was revised in October.
