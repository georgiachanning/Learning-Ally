Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

2018 school year, the district Professional Development for teachers has focused on Next Generation Science 
Standards.  There are three full training days with county guided science experts.  Teachers then work in grade level 
groupings to further p
repare the science materials for classroom instruction.  In addition, many of the early release 
Wednesdays during the school year have also been devoted to continued training with the NGSS.   The district has also 
established a Science Cadre in which desig
nated grade level teachers (voluntary) were trained to assist their grade level 
in deeper understanding of NGSS and their implementation.   Also, during the summer preceding this school year, the 
district invited teachers to meet by grade level with a trai
ner from the publisher of our new math curriculum.  The purpose 
of the week long session was to create a usable, consistent pacing guide for mathematics instruction by grade level.
 
 
Instructional aides are provided training both from outside sources (usual
ly county office of education opportunities) as 
well as individual one
-
on
-
one training to be sure they possess skills and strategies for teaching literacy.  Custodial and 
Maintenance staff have received a half day of training in strategies related to their
 
positions.  The secretarial staff receives 
annual training in areas affecting the current legal requirements they must know to perform their jobs accurately.
 
 
Waverly offers additional training opportunities for teachers and aides outside of the regular s
chool day on occasion.  
Some of these trainings includes English Language Development, SBAC Assessment training, Technology, AVID, NGSS, etc.  
During site PD days, the staff is learning a variety of student engagement strategies, as well as, data collectio
n and data 
analysis this school year.
