School Description
 
Roberts Ferry 
Charter School has distinguished itself for its nurturing and supportive environment 

student and their families.
 
 
Our charter school was established in the 

educational options.Challenges in the coming year include maintaining and improving upon this 
tradition of student learning in a supportive environment. A new facilities plan has been completed 
last year and 
is at the State Department for funding. The district sees a need for a 
gymnasium/cafeteria as the district has grown by 30% since 2016.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
R
eport Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California 
public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are 
required to prepare a Local Control and Accounta
bility Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SA
RC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the
 
CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact 
the school principal or the district 
office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district makes a great effort to ensure our school is clean, safe and functional. To assist in the effort, the district u
ses
 
a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School construction, in keeping with the Williams Legislation of 2004. 
This instrument provides 
specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to 
ensure our students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning 
environment.
 
 
On a quarterly basis, the district submits a Williams Settlement Uniform Complaint Report to the County Office of Education. 
To this date, no facilities 
complaint ha
s ever been filed with the district. Roberts Ferry School has three classrooms, a multipurpose room, and administrative offic
e. The school 
opened in 1919 in a schoolhouse that was replaced with a new building in 1976. An additional building was constructed
 
in 1986. Two portable classrooms 
were constructed in 1996. District maintenance staff ensures the repairs necessary to keep the school in good =condition and 
working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient 
service and emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The principal 
works with the custodian to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. The district participates in the St
ate School Deferred 
Maintenance Program, which provides
 
state matching funds on a dollar for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, el
ectrical syste
ms, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems. Modernization was completed in 2011.
 
 
Architectural planning for construction of a new building has taken place. Construction was completed in 2013. The buildings 
consist of an auxiliary 
classrooms, and
 
storage area.
