About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Faci
lity Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The third Lomita Park Elementary School building was constructed in 1970. It replaced two previous buildings that were the or
iginal schools in the area 
and the oldest when the City of Millbrae was
 
incorporated. At that time, the innovative trend was to use the pod design for instruction. The intermediate 
students in fourth and fifth grade now occupy the modular classrooms located nearby on the school grounds. The school is equi
pped with wireless 
In
ternet throughout the campus, and every classroom has four student computers in addition to access to Ipads and/or Chromebook
s. In addition, our 
school currently has 125 I
-
pads and 64 Chromebook Computers to utilize in the classrooms. Classrooms are using 
updated technology which include LCD 
projectors and document cameras. The custodians and district maintenance crew have set a goal of keeping every classroom and 
rest room clean and 
safe despite the cutbacks, budget reductions, and decreased maintenance st
aff. As an outcome of the needs assessment, during the 2006

2007 school 
year, we replaced the current air conditioning system and carpet and removed asphalt. In 2008

2009 plans were put into place to begin work on 
upgrading the fields and making changes to
 
the facilities by applying district bond funds. In the summer of 2009, we remodeled two bathrooms, painted 
the exterior, applied asphalt, upgraded lighting, and replaced four modular classrooms .During the summer of 2011, the school
 
received major upgrade
s 
that made the campus ADA compliant, including remodeled ramps with handicap accessibility to the main office and classrooms. 
This was made possible 
with money from the Measure X bond passed in May 2009.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Millbrae is supportive of its school system. Parents actively support Lomita Park in a variety of ways to help their children
 
succeed. Parents give input 
and work with staff members to improve services for students when they attend parent 
conferences, student study team meetings, parent education 
workshops, school social events, and informational meetings. They serve on governing committees such as the Title I Advisory 
Committee, ELAC, SSC, 
and PTA. They are encouraged  to volunteer in the 
classrooms and may contribute to the Lomita Park After School Program. Parents may attend school 
sponsored parent education events held at Lomita Park. The parent education events engage parents to volunteer and creates ac
tive parent leaders. The 
parents o
f students who fall below the school achievement criteria also are invited to several school meetings to learn how to better 
help their children 
succeed. Much of this information is posted on the school's website and our signboard at the corner of the cros
s streets for the school. Good school
-
parent communication promotes parent involvement and brings a significant amount of parent participation to Lomita Park Schoo
