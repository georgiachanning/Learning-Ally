About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). 
The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP),
 
which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Tarpey
 
was built in 1958. There are 23 standard classrooms and 14 portable classrooms, as well as two other rooms that fit into othe
r categories. We 
also have a Read 180 computer lab classroom to support student learning. The campus is a cornerstone of elementar
y schools in CUSD, and the condition

. Our custodians perform basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and 
buildings. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted two times a year at each site in the district.

campus inspections each year. T
his committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a 
regular basis to provide feedback to our student body.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Tarpey has a s
chool safety plan and a School Crisis Intervention Plan on file, and both are available to parents as well as the general pub
lic. Key elements 
of Tarpey

s school safety plan include the following:
 

 
Create a learning environment that ensures physical safety 
while providing inviting learning experiences
 

 
Maximize student achievement for every individual student
 

 
Involve all stakeholders in a collaborative process to ensure a safe, effective and efficient school environment
 

 
Involve all stakeholders in a collabora
tive process that articulates and practices the procedures for response to crisis or emergency situations
 
The school

s plans are reviewed and updated annually. Most recently, the plan was updated in January 2019. The administrative team devel
ops both 
plans
 
with input from staff, parents and community members who continue to work to ensure a safe, nonviolent environment on all of 
the Clovis Unified 
School District (CUSD) campuses. Campus monitors, teachers and administrators supervise students in an effort t
o keep students safe on campus before 
school beginning at 7:40 a.m., during recesses, lunch recesses, and after school until 6 p.m.

Opportunities for staff development are ongoing throughout the year. Many factors 
determine staff develop
-
ment needs during the 2018
-
19 school year, 
including teacher needs, assessment, and formal and informal discussions between faculty and the administration. Areas of pri
ority include the following.
 

 
Strategies for improving student ac
hievement in reading, writing and math using the new textbooks and online support programs for 
students
 

 
Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social sci
-
ence and science text for reading 
instruction
 

 
Use
 
of technology in the classroom to improve lesson engagement and more resources for student learning. Many classes use compute
rs 
and iPods to aid learning in the classroom. Teachers will also be able to take an entire class to the new computer lab for te
ch
nology
-
enhanced 
lessons.
 

 
Supporting instruction provided by our push
-
in teachers and support staff
 
 
Teachers: Professional growth time for teachers is provided each week on early release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers
 
share best practices and 
strat
egies; review student
-
performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences. 
Teachers are also supported monthly by individual mentoring and in
-
class coaching. Teachers are aware of school and
 
district funds that can provide for 
substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade
-
level articulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student 
achievement. Programs have focused on teaching writing, reading compr
ehension and English language development (ELD) curriculum. We also 
implemented new intervention/reteaching materials for mathematics during class time as well as during our
 
 
After School Education and Safety (ASES) program.
 
 
Teachers attend conferences th
roughout the year, and upon their return from these conferences, they share valuable information with their colleagues. 
The district also provides professional growth opportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars.
 
 
New teach
ers to our school or a grade level receive further support through the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Support and As
sessment 
(BTSA) program and through their association with individual support providers.
 
 
Tarpey places strong emphasis on professi
onal growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development. 
Grade
-
level leaders and teams have spent time at conferences learning how to develop effective teams as professional learning commu
nities. This 
informatio
n has helped our students as we focus on common essential standard instruction, data evaluation and strategic intervention su
pport.
 
 
Teachers are given extra time to process information gathered from staff development and work with peers to 
implement new strategies and 
instructional practices consistent throughout the grade level and school. Paraprofessionals and other school personnel: Tarpe
y believes paraprofessionals 
and other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on students 
and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made 
aware of the availability of school and district staff development and training funds. Personnel are invited to attend meetin
gs in which school resources 
are being allocated, participa
te in forums on current educational topics, attend school committees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.

Th
e district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery
 
learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural rel
evant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional developm
ent opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early
 
release days. A variety of after
-

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C

ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

School Plan
 

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every 
student.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http:/
/www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Commit
tee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committe
e 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity.
 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  T
he SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re
-
K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
