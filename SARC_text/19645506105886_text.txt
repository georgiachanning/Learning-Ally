About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by s
tate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are req
uired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mor
e information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the
 
school principal or the 
district office.

ided input 
and implemented the use of web and cell technology as a means to provide real time information in the event of an emerge
ncy. The plan details 
procedures for emergencies that may occur. Regularly scheduled drills help us practice and review our plans for fire, earthqu
akes, lockdowns and 
evacuations. We take part in any/all disaster drills organized by the district. To add to
 
the effectiveness of crisis communication, Bitely has employed the 
Catapult emergency system and is managed by the school safety team should an emergency arise. The Bitely Comprehensive Safety
 
Plan is reviewed and 
approved yearly by the School Site Counci
l. Last Updated 1/17/19, Last Reviewed with SCC 1/17/19.
