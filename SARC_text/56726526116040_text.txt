CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENTCitrus Glen Elementary School™s discipline policies are based upon a schoolwide 
discipline plan and RtI (Response to Intervention) behavior model, which are used as a 
guide to develop school rules, develop behavior management programs, promote 
responsibility, promote respect, and minimize classroom disruptions. 
The principal holds an assembly regarding responsible behavior and school expectations. 
Teachers clearly identify and explain behavior expectations to their students and discuss 
consequences for poor or disruptive behavior in the classroom. The principal visits the 
kindergarten classrooms to reinforce behavior expectations.  Students in grades 1-5 
attend an assembly led by the principal who discusses the importance of good citizenship 
and following school rules. Citrus Glen Elementary School employs behavior support 
programs focused on improving classroom behavior, establishing clear behavior 
expectations, reducing misbehavior, motivating students to put forth their best effort, 
increasing academic engagement, and teaching students to behave respectfully and to 
value diversity.
The Class Size Distribution table in this report illustrates the distribution of class sizes by 
grade level, the average class size, and the number of classes that contain 1-20 students, 
21-32 students, and 33 or more students.
