By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Marshall Elementary opened in 1949. In 2001, all permanent classrooms and the school library underwent major 
renovations. Portable classrooms have been added over the years to accommodate growth. Marshall has 28 classrooms, 
a computer lab, a library, a mul
tipurpose room used for lunch, assemblies and school performances, and a large expansive 
playground.
 
 
All classrooms are equipped with a telephone, an interactive whiteboard, mobile devices for student use and a networked 
computer, and a printer. Telephone
s have intercom and local calling ability. Teachers use a computer based attendance 
program, communicate via e
-
mail, and use the internet for instructional planning and lesson design.All  teachers utilize 
interactive whiteboards to enhance instruction and 
increase student engagement. Students use classroom computers to 
extend learning activities.
 
 
Providing our students with a safe and clean campus is a top priority. Classrooms and rest rooms are cleaned daily. 
Restrooms are inspected throughout the school 
day by the custodial staff. Monthly site inspections are completed by the 
school principal. Ongoing corrective and preventive maintenance is scheduled routinely throughout the year.

More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in a
n online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more.
 
The important purpose of this 
assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines 
for this assessment 
were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page survey form used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Marshall School welcomes family and community members as part of the educational team. We believe that adult support 
is critical to overall student success. Opportunities for parent involvement are offered throughout the year. Volunteer 
activities include 
working with students in the classroom, serving on parent advisory councils, assisting with special events 
and school activities, and by joining the Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).
 
 
The School Site Council, which includes parents and staff members, meet
s four to six times a year. The School Site Council 
gives parents the opportunity to make recommendations on school programs, and provide input into how school funds 
are utilized. We encourage parents to become involved in other advisory committees such as
 
the English Language 
Learners Advisory Committee, Title 1 Parent Committee, Migrant Parent Advisory Committee and the School Advisory 
Committee.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority at Marshall Elementary. Operational standards are in place to ensure that the Marshall staff
 
maintains a safe and clean campus. The school staff monitors the school grounds prior to the start of the school day, 
during the s
chool day, and at dismissal times. For student safety, all visitors must register at the school office using the 
Raptor system, an online database, for clearance and wear an identification badge while on campus. The site safety and 
emergency plan is review
ed and updated annually. The plan specifies procedures for dealing with fire, flood, earthquake, 
violence, and hazardous waste emergencies. Monthly fire drills and quarterly disaster drills are held to ensure that staff 
and students are prepared should an 
emergency situation arise. Students are expected to be safe, trustworthy, 
accountable and respectful at all times. The staff uses a positive discipline approach for behavior to ensure high academic 
standards and to keep students safe. Students participate 
in a school wide incentive program that promotes the 
development of good character. Character development is an integral part of the school mission. Our goal is for students 
to feel safe, respected and cared for while on the school campus. The safety plan 
was last updated and discussed with 
school faculty on October 7, 2019.

Marshall teachers are provided opportunities to participate in professional development activities on an ongoing basis. 
Student assessment results and teacher surveys determine the focus for staff training. Professional development is held 
prior to the sta
rt of school and on designated Wednesdays (early release schedule) during the school year.
 
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, staff members concentrated on implementing the California Common Core State 
Standards. Professional development activities focused
 
on lesson design,  increasing student engagement/participation, 
enhancing vocabulary instruction for English Learners and providing differentiated learning opportunities for students 
who are performing below grade level expectations in the area of reading
 
and writing. Areas of focus included test data 
analysis, standards training, instructional strategies and curriculum development. Staff development opportunities may 
include presentations by outside consultants, conferences, and peer presentations. Variou
s strategies of support, based 
on individual teacher needs, are provided such as: academic coaching support, observation feedback, grade level 
meetings, peer observations, and classroom visitations. New teachers participate in the Induction program and rec
eive 
additional professional development.
 
 
The staff has formed Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) at each grade level. Teachers work collaboratively with 
each other and administration to examine student work, evaluate test data, and develop lessons
 
to support student 
learning. Assessment information includes results of weekly quizzes, end of chapter tests, and quarterly benchmark exams 
and skill assessments.
