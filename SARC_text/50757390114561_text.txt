School Description
 

develop socially responsible learners who:
 
*Create
 
*Collaborate
 
*Communicate
 
&
 
*Critically Think
 
through the rigorous academic integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) 
within the Math/Science and Visual/Performing Art 
Magnets.
 
 
Walnut Elementary Education Center opened in August 2007 and is currently in its 13th year of 

Discovery Math/Science Magnet and the Renaissance Visual 
and Performing Arts Magnet. A 
continuous stream of magnet specific and whole school events, along with a popular elective 

science lab, a fully working stage, 
and music room. Walnut is working towards developing as a 
professional learning community through its focus on high levels of learning for ALL students. All 
grade levels use state standards and district
-
adopted curriculum to teacher essential skills. 
Teach

unique focus while ensuring all students have STEAM experiences.
 
 
Total enrollment at Walnut is 912 students, with 456 in each magnet. There are 6 kindergarten 
cl
asses, 18 classes in grades 1
-
3, and 12 classes in grades 4
-
6. School enrollment is dependent on a 
lottery held each winter for students who apply for entry. There currently is a waiting list for each 
magnet; therefore classes are always loaded to maximum 
capacity. Siblings of current Walnut 
students receive first priority in order to ensure families are kept together. Our school's progress 
indicators include the Dashboard and district and site assessments. Walnut Elementary Education 
Center earned a Califo
rnia Distinguished School Award for 2012, a CSBA Golden Bell in 2017, and 
has benefited from numerous monetary prizes and grant awards.
 
 
Walnut Elementary welcomes involvement from our community to provide our students the best 
learning experience possible
. Each year, there are over 600 approved volunteers at Walnut who 
help support a variety of program and activities. Walnut partners with many local agencies and has 
a monthly kindness focus through which students learn about giving and community service. 
W
alnut is also home to a strong Parent
-
Teacher organization. The PTO fundraisers help to support 
many activities and events at Walnut through which many parents and community members can 
become involved with our school.

About th
e SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Loca
l Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to 
address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
