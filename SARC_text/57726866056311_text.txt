By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
About This School:  Esparto Elementary School is located in Esp
arto, near the California Coastal Range in the western part 
of Yolo County. Esparto is a rural community of about 3000 people. The Esparto Unified School District serves the 
communities of the beautiful Capay Valley, as well as Madison and Esparto. Esparto
 
Elementary School, a middle school, 
a high school, and a continuation high school are all located within the district boundaries. The community is about an 
hour from Sacramento and an hour and a half from the Bay Area. Our rural community is changing. Agr
iculture is the main 
economic focus of this area, and many of our parents work in this industry. Cache Creek Casino, located in the Capay 
Valley, is the other major employer of parents in our school. Our school is made up of: 78% Hispanic; 15% Caucasian; a
nd 
7% other ethnicities. Approximately 90% of our student body is on the Free and Reduced Lunch program. Forty
-
one 
percent of our students are English Learners. New housing developments have brought in new students and families to 
our community and our sch
ool. Each year about 50 students who live in the Madison Migrant Camp are with us from April 
15 to November 1. Professional development has continued to be an area of emphasis. Many factors in our school make 
us confident that we will see increasing academ
ic growth among our students. All teachers and instructional assistants 
are highly qualified professionals. From 2000 until the present we have purchased and put in place common core 
standards
-
based and State Board of Education approved curricular and supp
lemental material in the major subject areas 

continue to receive ongoing professional development in order to help them stay abreast of state 
initiatives.  Teachers 
have been consistently trained in grade specific curricular material.  One significant intervention has been to dedicate a 
90
-
minute time block to Early Literacy in grades Kindergarten
-
2nd.  During this time students receive targeted
 
instruction 
in English Language Arts, Guided Reading, and Enrichment or Intervention as needed. This will assist with developing 
interdisciplinary vocabulary, while enriching reading and writing to improve our reading scores.  Guided reading 
assessments w
ill be given four times a year.  Staff collaboration at each grade level is strong and regularly scheduled.  
Parents and community members take part in our school as volunteers and members of advisory committees. All staff 
members: teachers, aides, secreta
ries, food service workers, the librarian, other support staff and custodians work 
together for the good of students. The Character Counts Program actively helps students learn to develop positive 
character traits. A nurturing, exciting, academic, and safe
 
environment is provided to our students daily. We are a positive 
caring school that stresses academic excellence, life skills, and supports all of our students as they grow toward reaching 
their full potential in becoming contributing members of society.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Routine maintenance and 
cleaning keep Esparto Elementary in exemplary condition.  The grounds and parking lots are 
kept free of debris and our landscaping is well maintained.   Only the front entrance to the school remains accessible 
during the day.   The district uses SchoolDude
, a web
-
based product, to schedule and monitor maintenance requests.  This 
has greatly expedited work orders being completed in a more time
-
efficient manner.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All 
schools in the district have comprehensive School Safety Plans approved by the School Site Council (SSC).  The 
responsibility for developing and writing the plan is shared between the school safety committee and the SSC.  It includes 
an assessment of the c
urrent status of school crime, procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils, disaster 
procedures, child abuse reporting procedures, rules and procedures on school discipline, school wide dress code, policies 
regarding actions which lead to suspension/
expulsion and sexual harassment policy.  The Comprehensive School Safety 
Plan will be reviewed and updated by winter of 2020 by the Administrative Leadership Team and School Safety Plan 
Committee. All classroom teachers have access to safety procedures and
 
first aid supplies. Fire and other hazard drills are 
performed and monitored monthly.  Exit maps are posted by all doors and fire extinguishers are located throughout the 
school.  In order to ensure student safety, adult supervision is provided before/aft
er school and during lunch recess. The 
Emergency Preparedness Manual has been updated for the 2019
-
2020 school year. In addition, all school activities are 
supervised by administration and teachers.  The schools are designed to limit and control unauthoriz
ed access during the 
school day.  Signage is posted requiring visitors to check in at the office.  The district takes great efforts to ensure that
 
all 
schools are clean, safe, and functional.  The district has implemented an online program
--
SchoolDude
--
tha
t ensures that 
the repairs necessary to keep the school sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  
SchoolDude ensures efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  5th  grade students and 
staff
 
will take the National Healthy Kids Survey in January of 2019.  These results will be made available to the public once 
the school receives this document. Several staff were trained last year on the use of Automatic Electronic Defibrilator(AED) 
and one AE
D is located on the elementary campus.

2018 The primary focus for Professional Development continues to be on Early Literacy.  Our Early 
Literacy teacher 
provided a week
-
long intensive training during the summer of 2017 on Guided Reading.  She and the site administrator 
gave the training again in the Fall to teachers who were not able to attend in the summer.  In addition, the Early Literac
y 
teacher trained the staff on the use of new
-
site adopted reading assessments that follow the guided Reading program.  
The site purchased test kits and iPads for each grade level to facilitate this process.  The site also continues to focus 
professional d
veelopment time on CAASPP readiness through implementation and analysis of Interim Assessment Block 
tests.

District.  the district received a grant form teh Low Performing Students Block G
rant, which was used to bring a content 
expert in Math to the district in August 2019.  20 teachers participated in five days of professionald development training 
and cololaborative planning.  in addition, Esparto Elementary is piloting two new Science cu
rricula in the 2019
