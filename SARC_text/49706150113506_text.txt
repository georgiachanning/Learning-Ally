By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Taylor Mountain Elementary School, established in 2007,
 
is the newest transitional Kindergarten through Sixth grade 
elementary school in the Bellevue Union School District. Taylor Mountain Elementary School sits next to an open field, a 
creek and Taylor Mountain. It is a beautiful school setting in beautiful S
onoma County. The mission statement or 'why' for 
Taylor Mountain Elementary School and our school community is to give students what they need. The entire staff works 
diligently to provide support for students both academically and socio
-
emotionally. Taylo

continue the high academic standards set by the district and establish a sense of community. Taylor Mountain is 
committed to supporting the students it serves academically, emotionally, and physically in a positive and safe sc
hool 
environment. There is firm belief that all students can learn through identifying individual strengths. We are responsible 
for providing opportunities for our students to be successful and thus gain in confidence and self
-
esteem. Collaboration 
within 
the community is an essential part of our school. The students at Taylor Mountain are supported academically and 
behaviorally as well through our after school program, CalSERVES, serving Kindergarten
-
6th grade students. In addition, 
we are fortunate to off
er after school clubs and activities for our students some of which include: Volleyball, basketball, 
weekly piano lessons with Move Over Mozart, and special offerings in collaboration with Sonoma Academy.
 
 
Expectations are high for students, staff, and the
 
Taylor Mountain community. The staff collaborates on a weekly basis to 
plan lessons, analyze student assessments and regroup for instruction. The staff is professional, nurturing, and committed 
to providing to our  students the best education possible. A 
clearly articulated standards
-
based curriculum is delivered to 
all students, thus enabling them to reach their potential. Well
-
defined goals foster creativity and initiate high academic 
achievement for all. The extensive use of technology is employed to as
sist with the dis
-
aggregation and analysis of student 
test data to guide instruction. In addition, all instructional staff participate in staff development activities focused on 
instructional strategies and the analysis of student test data. Taylor Mountai
n continues to make strides in terms of 
providing technological access for our students. This year students in 3rd
-
6th grade have 1
-
1 Chromebook access with 
grades K

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cleanliness and maintenance of 
facilities are extremely high priorities at our school. In the summer of 2018, the HVAC 
system was completely replaced allowing for heat and air conditioning in all rooms on campus.  There are a few buildings 
(4) that require shingles where the roof ridgel
ine exists.  These are being replaced.
 
 
We have worked diligently to discover the various needs of our campus and have identified several projects that are 
planned to be addressed during the period of 2019
-
2024. Projects identified can be found at 
https://
www.busd.org/Page/54 under the heading BUSD 2019

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Parents play an 
important role in our school community and are formally involved in Taylor Mountain Elementary School 
through our PTA, School Site Council and volunteer opportunities. We strive to increase parent participation as well as 
offering  family evening and schoo
l day events. We offer evening educational events such as Literacy Night, Math Nights, 
Movie Nights, Choir performances, Back to School Night and Open House. Many parents serve as volunteers in classrooms 
for special school programs and events as well as p
roviding general assistance when needed. Our after school program, 
that is offered by CalSERVES, has a multitude of evening events that are well attended by our families. All written and 
verbal communication from the school is translated into both English 
and Spanish including upcoming events  listed on 
our marquee as well as information contained on our school website. We also employ use of Blackboard, which is a 
program that allows us to contact our parents via telephone and email and leave pertinent scho

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

safety of students and staff in case of an emergency. It includes the ability to 
communicate with the district office and outside agencies for ongoing support services through a strong network of city, 
county, state and federal communication services. Scho
ol
-
wide safety drills are conducted monthly. The current School 
Safety Plan is now part of the Bellevue Union School District Safety Plan. This plan outlines procedures both general 
(district wide) and specific (site wide) that are essential in the event o
f an emergency at all of our school sites. School 
safety is discussed at school staff meetings and during PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention and Support) meetings. Parents 
are kept apprised of important school information through use of Blackboard as wel
l as through the monthly newsletters. 
Our school behavior program, PBIS, teaches students the appropriate and expected behaviors. Three times each year, the 
entire school participates in 'Expectation Stations' where students rotate through the different ar
eas of campus (including 
classrooms) and review the rules and expectations for each area. Positive acknowledgement for expected behavior is given 
through our use of 'Hawk Hoorays' which are positive acknowledgement certificates that are given to students t
hat are 
demonstrating behaviors that are safe, responsible and respectful. Weekly drawings of these certificates provides 
additional acknowledgement and rewards for our students. At Taylor Mountain Elementary School student safety is of the 
highest priorit
y.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Ongoing professional development is an important part of improving our school program. Our school district invests 
heavily in professional development and as a 
result our students receive excellent instruction. The school district and 
Taylor Mountain Elementary provide professional development targeted to raise student performance on the CAASPP. 
The major improvement efforts this year have focused on English lang
uage development, and ELPAC training. Site 
leadership team including principal and teachers have been participating in the California Principal Support Network which 
focuses on developing and sustaining a strong professional learning community with a colla
borative culture. 100% of the 
teachers at our school have engaged in advanced training designed to promote specific skills or information related to 
these school priorities and objectives. Our district also provides individualized coaching through the use 
of a consulting 
teacher and release time to observe in other classrooms for teachers to receive additional professional development and 
support in individual areas of need. Teachers meet at least weekly in PLCs and collaboration time to analyze student dat
a, 
plan instruction and evaluate student learning. Technology is used extensively to disaggregate and analyze student data 
to guide instruction.
