School Description
 
Dear Families,
 
 
It is a true honor to be a part of the Washington community!  It is a postcard beautiful school with 
classic and stately architecture surrounded by lush park grounds that draw families who walk from 
nearby apartments, bungalows and sprawling homes, all whe
re cherry orchards once stood. The 
diversity in architecture reflects the myriad faces in this community. The culturally and linguistically 
rich backgrounds, the inviting neighborhood, and inspired staff are just some of the key elements 
that make Washingt
on Elementary a coveted school in this district.
 
 
Our dedicated teachers provide a rigorous academic curriculum based on Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS)  and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to ensure access to all of our 
students. We incorporat
e Project Based Learning throughout the school day to help solidify the 
standards in a meaningful and memorable way. We collaborate and analyze data regularly to 
produce deeper and individualized learning pathways for every student.
 
 
We have worked especia
lly hard to create a true home
-
school connection, where families are 
welcome to be on our campus before, during and after school. On any given day you will find our 
Parent Center and our classrooms bustling with volunteers. We have a dedicated parent facil
itator 

 
 
Washington School has a robust Spanish Biliteracy Pathway program from first through fifth grade. 
We have a Dual Language Immersion(DLI) program that began with two 
Kindergarten classes (in 
2017) and is growing each year (currently, we are in our 3rd year). We believe that these programs 
promote the benefits of learning two languages, lead to increased friendships among multiple 
language groups and affirm all of our s

achievement for all students.
 
 
We also believe that our students must have access to enrichment opportunities to help maintain 
focus on their future aspirations and dreams. This belief was the basis for the 
development of a 
substantial after school program. In addition to traditional extended learning after school 
programs, we offer a variety of outside of school classes each year. Examples include classes such 
as Theater, Robotics, Coding, Ballet Folkl√≥rico,
 
Jazz Band, Creative Arts, Hip Hop Dance, Science in 

to instill the love of reading and allow access to computers and technology.
 
 
There are so many unique a
nd amazing opportunities available for Washington students and their 
families. It would take pages to capture them all here! We offer tours to prospective families on 
the first Monday of each month at 9:30 AM. I can be reached directly at (510) 618

School Mission Statement
 
The Washington School Community is dedicated to providing equal access to learning for all students, where race, gender or 
socioeconomic status d
oes not predict which students achieve at school. Through culturally responsive instructional practices we 
recognize the varied learning styles and intelligence of all students while maintaining high expectations. We strive to provi
de a nurturing, 
respectf
ul, and safe learning environment that will empower children with skills and knowledge that will lead to their success in a c
hanging 
world. Our commitment to the implementation of state standards through the use of board
-
adopted curricula will ensure that 
all students 
achieve high levels of proficiency as determined by grade level, school, district, and state measures.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requi
red by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs)
 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an 
LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should co
ntact the school principal or the 
district office.

Parent involvement is very important at Washington School. Our Parent Center serves as a gathering point for parents during t
he school day, before and 
after school. We host weekly Wednesday morning meetings for parent
s that include general coffee and conversation and workshops based on parent 
requests. We also have an active Parent Teacher Organization that meets in the evenings on the first Tuesday of the month at 
6 PM. In addition to PTO, 

at meets off

has a profound impact on the school budget and all are welcome to attend. Washington has an English Language Advisory Committ
ee that m
eets once a 
month in the mornings. This meeting covers various topics pertinent to the success of our English Learners. We have an Africa
n American Parent group 
that meets both during mornings and evenings. We use this time to ensure that we are meeting th
e needs of our African American students.
 
 
We have a multitude of events that take place during the year that parents, partnering with staff, provide for our students a
nd our community. Any 
parents interested in participating are welcome to call Maria Ocho

and psychological harm. The governing Boar
d is fully committed to maximizing school safety and to creating a positive learning environment that includes 
strategies for violence prevention and high expectations for student conduct, responsible behavior, and respect for others.
 
The school site council at Washington School develops a comprehensive school safety plan relevant to the needs and resources 
of that particular school. 
A current copy of the school plan is required to be kept on file. Washington staff reviewed this at the 
October staff meeting.

Our District is committed to excellent Professional Development. Several times a year our teachers receive training in the la
test technology, curriculum, 
English Language Development, National Science Standards, ultimately refining the delivery of Common C
ore State Standards. In addition to the District 
PD, each Wednesday Washington teachers participate in optional mini PDs that strengthen their practice throughout each school
 
year.  Washington 
teachers are allotted three professional days to work collabora
tively. This time is used to incorporate Project Based Learning into their daily teaching. All 
teachers also have the opportunity to work with Instructional coaches in the classroom and during collaboration time. New tea
chers participate in BTSA 
(Beginning
 
Teachers Support and Assessment). Washington teachers were all trained at the Museum of Tolerance on the incorporation of Soc
ial Justice 
standards into their every day practice.
