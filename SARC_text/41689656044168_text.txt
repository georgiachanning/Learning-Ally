School Description
 
Laurel School is one K
-
5 School that is housed on two campuses, which are about two miles apart.  
The Laurel Lower Campus serves students kindergarten, first, and second grades. A district run 
preschool and special educatio
n preschool are also on our Lower Campus. The Laurel Upper 
Campus serves students in third, fourth, and fifth grades.
 
 
Laurel School's Lower Campus is located in a residential area of Atherton, serving 350 students. It 
is a leafy campus, with the classroom
s built around central interior collaborative spaces, often used 
for small break out groups that are supported by instructional aides, para
-
educators, and parent 
volunteers.
 
 
Just two miles away, in the Willows neighborhood of Menlo Park, lies 
Laurel's Upper Campus. Our 
Upper Campus serves our 350 third through fifth grade students. Laurel's Upper Campus building 
opened in October 2016.
 
 
Across the two campuses, the certificated school staff include: 32 FTE regular education classroom 
teachers, two half
-
time EL specialist teachers, two reading specialists, one librarian, one full time 
and three part
-
time music teachers, two half
-
time art s
pecialists, one P.E. teacher, three RSP 
teachers, one school counselor, one school psychologist, and two administrators. Part
-
time 
classified staff include instructional aides (1 hour for every K
-
3 classroom), para
-
educators, science 
aides, one LVN/admin a
ssistant at each campus, and a full
-
time Office Manager at each campus.
 
 
We live by our Laurel School Vision, which was the result of an iterative process, was created in 
2016 with input from teachers, students, and community members:
 
 
"Laurel School:  The
 
Best Place to Spend Your Childhood! We are Confident Students who 
experience joyful learning, social
-
emotional wellness, and are globally minded. We are Passionate 
Teachers who are child
-
centered and practice reflective collaboration. We are an Involved 
C
ommunity that builds relationships with each other, the staff, and all our students."
 
 
As one of the four schools of the Menlo Park City School District, Laurel School also pursues the 
District's mission:
 
"We are a community working together to inspire hig
h academic achievement among all students, 
serve their needs, challenge their minds, and enrich their lives, laying a foundation for success and 
participation in our democratic society and as citizens of the world."
 
and the District's Vision:
 
"Every child 
achieves academic excellence.
 
Every child becomes emotionally and physically stronger.
 
Every child discovers and grows their talents."

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The S
ARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whic
h describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more informati
on about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Laurel School is one school across two campuses, which sit approximately 2 miles apart.
 
 
The Lower Campus, which houses K
-
2 students is located on 95 Edge Road in Atherton and has 23 
classrooms, a music room, an art room, a multipurpose 
room, a "mini multi," a library, a computer lab, and an administration building. The campus is approximately 60 years old.  O
ne of the buildings houses 
the MPCSD Early Learning Center and Heritage Oak C
hildren's Center, which are preschool programs.
 
 
A major renovation of the facility was completed in 1999, and as a result, all classrooms are wired for internet, phone and c
able TV. In 2006, the 
community approved a $91.1 million bond measure to improve d
istrict facilities. From 2008
-
2011, Laurel School completed modernization and site 
improvements that were not completed with the last Bond measure, and two new classroom pod buildings and three specialist cla
ssrooms were 
constructed to replace aging portab
les. In the summer of 2014, the District did a volunteer seismic project to ensure student safety in the classrooms 
that were built in the 1950s.
 
 
In 2014, MPCSD community passed the Measure W bond, which funded the construction of Laurel's Upper Campus on
 
275 Elliott Drive in Menlo Park. 
This campus includes 16 classrooms, 3 specialty classrooms, library, administration, gym, stage, and collaborations areas.  T
he Upper Campus opened on 
October 17, 2016, and it includes a gym, playground, hardcourt, and gra
ss field.
 
 
The District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Di
rector of Maintenance and Operations 
and the custodial crew conduct an annual walk
-
through to identify and prioritize ne
cessary maintenance projects.
 
 
The District maintenance staff keeps the school in good repair and working order by completing necessary tasks in a timely ma
nner. A work order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given 
the highest priority. Cleaning standards for all schools in the district have been 
established. The Principal, Assistant Principal, and Director of Maintenance and Operations work closely with the custodial s
taff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure cle
an and safe school campuses. The District annually sets monies aside for long
-

maintenance plan is available at the District Office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Bal
anced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible studen
ts 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

"We are an involved community!" Our vision statement rings true in the classroom, on the PTO, and in the community.
 
 
Each year, parent volunteers contribute thousands of hours to help enrich the children's
 
education at Laurel School. Every parent has competing demands 
on their time, from paid employment to younger children. But, Laurel School encourages parents to volunteer in a way that wil
l be meaningful to them 
and their child 
-
 
we can assure you that it
 
will be meaningful for the entire Laurel School community.
 
 
Parents, grandparents, friends, and neighbors volunteer in many ways: one morning each week to help in the classroom, a half 
hour a month to assist in 
art class, a couple of days in the summer to
 
set up the car line/carpool, monthly Art in Action lessons (109 parent volunteers in 2019), or one morning in 
April for the STEAM Fair (over 100 parent volunteers).
 
Within the Laurel PTO, parents can volunteer to serve on one of our dozens of committees.
 
 
The parents at Laurel School are very supportive. 85% of our families are members of the PTO, which has a voluntary executive
 
board of 18 parents.   
Additionally, hundreds of parents serve on over 35 different PTO committees which enhance and support our 
Laurel instructional program and school 
community. Many parents choose to volunteer to support the Art Specialist, who delivers weekly art instruction to each K
-
5 student. 109 parent 
volunteers deliver monthly Art in Action lessons in each classroom. The P
TO also coordinates a hot food offering every day of the week. Classroom 
teachers are supported by a large group of parent volunteers who help with small group instruction, organize field trip chape
rones, and plan seasonal 
celebrations. Spanish speaking pa
rents are encouraged and recruited to support instruction in our Spanish Immersion classrooms.  The librarian uses 
parents to help manage the circulation of books within our library.
 
 
Many of our Project Based Learning units incorporate expert speakers fro
m the community.  From a dad who presents about sound waves, to a mom 
who is a local community organizer for the broad Safe Routes to School Program, to the parent who works in virtual reality, p
arents are invited to share 
their real
-
world expertise with L
aurel students on a regular basis.

Eight parents, in partnership with as eight teachers, serve on our Laurel School Site Council, which meets on a monthly basis
 
to review and monitor the 
Laurel School Site Plan.
 
 
Finally, to engage our parents from underr
epresented households, Laurel parents attend monthly district level parent cafes and bi
-
annual school 
community meetings.  During these meetings, District and School Leadership solicit input from parents of students from low so
cioeconomic households 
to und
erstand how we can better serve their needs.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School 
Safety Plan
 
The Menlo Park City School District incorporates requirements of all legislative mandates into a single Emergency Preparednes
s Plan that is updated 
annually. The Assistant Principal manages the School Safety Plan that coordinates concerns of pa
rents, students, and staff for the safety and welfare of 
all. The Safety Plan is reviewed and revised annually and appropriate drills and training are provided to help all persons be
come familiar with their 
responsibilities. Emergency preparedness also inc
ludes close cooperation and planning with police, fire, civic emergency agencies and school/parent 
groups.
 
 
The safety and security of Laurel students and staff is our number one priority. Each month, we practice a particular safety 
drill so our students a
nd staff 
know what to do in the event of an emergency. Along with all schools in MPCSD, we follow the "Big 5" Safety Protocols outline
d by the San Mateo County 
Office of Education. We practice how to "Drop, Cover and Hold On" in the event of an earthquake 
and how we evacuate buildings in the event of a fire. 
Here at Laurel, we are all working proactively together to keep our students safe at all times.
