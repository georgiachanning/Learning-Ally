School Description
 
SCHOOL DESCRIPTION:
 
Rio Vista Elementary School is located in Cathedral City.  As one of sixteen elementary schools in 
the Palm Springs Unified School District, Rio Vista serves 
approximately 720 students in grades Pre
-
K  thr
ough five. The campus consists of 33 classrooms for general education and special education 
instruction, a multipurpose building, an administrative office and library building and a large 
playground. A Head St
art building is also located on our campus. The
 
school is located in a 
neighborhood where extensive home building continues to be part of the landscape. The majority 
of our students live within walking distance.  Our programs include a Student Success Team
 
to 
eliminate barriers to student success. The 
process may help to identify students needing special 
education resources, which include Special Day classes, Resource specialist assistance and Speech 
and Language services. A speech therapist and a certified
 
speech assistant provides services for all 
stu
dents needing services. There are four Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) cluster classes. 
Two in each third through fifth grades. The program extends beyond the grade level curriculum to 
include enrichment 
activities. English learners receive full instr
uction in English. Bilingual aides 
provide support for students in English Learner grade level designated instructional blocks with 
specific curriculum and presentation designed for all children who need assis
tance with learning 
academic English language. 
Interventions are provided daily to meet the academic needs of all 
students. The Rio Vista website is up and running.  We also have a Twitter account. A dedicated 
cadre of parents volunteer regularly in classr
ooms.
 
 
GOALS:
 
1.  Teachers will plan and instru
ct students based on the Common Core State Standards in ELA, ELD, 
Math and the NGSS standards in science.
 
Teachers will collaborate weekly for the purpose of planning, assessing and revising instruction.  
Plan
ning instruction will incorporate standards, cu
rriculum, student to student engagement 
strategies, English Language Development strategies and student to teacher engagement 
strategies.  Teachers will analyze data from assessments to gauge student learning 
and instructional 
effectiveness.  Additional su
pport staff will be provided through the site budget for the purpose of 
supporting teachers and students.
 
2.  School staff will partner with parents for the purpose of planning and implementing campus 
safety, 
positive student behavior processes, positive s
tudent attendance and parent education.  
School personnel will maintain effective communication with parents and families using notices 
home, mass phone messages, electronically posted notifications and contac
ts at the school site.  
School office staff wil
l assist parents, families and community members who have questions and 
concerns with a customer friendly attitude.  Parents will serve on school committees (School Site 
Council, Safety Committee, Positive Beh
avior and Discipline Committee, and English Lan
guage 
Advisory Committee) for the purpose of providing input and and a connection between home and 
school.
 
3.  School staff will partner with parents and community to provide a safe and secure campus and 
learn
ing environment.   Parents and school staff wil
l continually review and revise the school safety 
plan and the school positive behavior plan that will include Other Means of Correction for negative 
student behavior.  Strategies for this will include Restora

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is requir
ed by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) 
are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an L
CAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

the development of Rio Vista's parent engagement policy by sending all notices to all
 
families in English and Spanish 
of meeting dates for School Site 
Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, Back to School Nights, all parent education nights/days, PTA meetings, and all o
ther functions where 
parents have the opportunity to participate 
in.
 
 
The school partners with the
 
PSUSD Family Engagement Center for the purpose of offering training and education for parents at the school site.  School 
Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, Parent Teacher Association meeting dates and times
 
are all posted in the office and
 
on social media 
sites and communication apps.  Parents and family members are invited to participate in all posted meetings and activities.  
All households receive 
information on dates and times for parent/teacher conferen
ces, Parent Teacher Associations,
 
Back to School Nights, Theme activity nights and other 
activities/events that occur during the year.  Translators are provided for meetings, evening after school programs, and pare
nt conferences. Our entire 
facility is han
dicap accessible and our multipur
pose room has an Assistive Listening System for the hearing impaired. A bilingual secretary and clerk are 
available to maintain communication with all of our parents.  Teachers develop parent classroom participation schedul
es in accordance with the needs 
o
f the students. These volunteers tutor individual students and small groups of students, assist teachers in the classroom, gi
ve support to the office staff, 
and help out during special programs.

Each year we have 
designed professional learning based on student achievement data, research of best practices and discussions with teachers an
d 
principals. The specific ap
proaches vary by content area. For ELA, in 2017
-
18, the focus was on aligning instruction to Smarter B
alanced Assessments, 
depth of knowledge, and deeper understanding of the Reading Targets in Claim 1. In 2018
-
19 the focus was on the gradual release model
, and 2019
-
20 
was an extension of the previous two years. The professional development in these areas 
was provided by the Schoolhouse Project. In 2018
-
19 the 
teachers began working with High Impact Math consultants. This professional development centers ar

The training will take place over the course of thre
e years.  During Year 1 (2018
-
19) the focus was on developing strategies to support number sense by 
implementing mental math routines and highlight the la
ndscape of learning in mathematics. During Year 2 (2019
-
20) the focus is on strengthening mental 
math 
routines, identifying the math goal of a lesson, and planning for and implementing a three
-
part lesson (Launch, Explore, Summarize). This 
professional dev
elopment also supports teachers with the implementation of the district
-
adopted math program (Bridges 
in Mathematics and Number 
Corner).
 
The numbers in the chart above represent 4 days of ELA training in 2017
-
18. For both 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 there are 6 da
ys per year of training for ELA. 
The remaining number of days in 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 are full days of 
professional learning for math.
