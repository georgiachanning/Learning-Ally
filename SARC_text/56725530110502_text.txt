Rancho Rosal is an exemplary school made possible by a dedicated team of parents, teachers, staff, 
and students. Our school is an example of excellence in education. Teachers work together in 
Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC) to provide a quality educational program where students 
learn at high levels. Instruction is differentiated so that every student has the opportunity to reach 


at Rancho Rosal. Beyond academics, students also learn the importance of being responsible and 
caring people who lead with integrity. We focus on creating a positive school culture that addresses 
students' social
-
emotional well be
ing with a school
-
wide positive behavior plan, social
-
emotional 
curriculum, and a focus on student leadership. We build on the concepts of respect, responsibility, 
and cooperation.  Like our mascot, the stallion, our school represents pride and strength. O
ur 
students are challenged daily to master academic standards, be creative thinkers, problem solvers, 
communicators, caring individuals, and lifelong learners. Mastery is measured by ongoing and 
recurring authentic and standards
-
based assessments. Working 
as a Professional Learning 
Community, student achievement will be supported by research
-
based instructional strategies.
 
 
Rancho Rosal Mission Statement
 
At Rancho Rosal Elementary we empower our students to learn at high levels, lead with integrity,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (
SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mo
re information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE 
LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);
