Principal's Message
 
It is my pleasure to share our school mission, vision, goals, and the programs Green Valley employs 
to ensure each child thrives. Green Valley has a long
-
standing tradition of excellence. We focus on 
promoting academic achievement as well as social and emo
tional well being for every child. Our 

balanced, strength based, meaningful curriculum. Our academic curriculum is standards based, and 
our instructional strate
gies use researched best practices. These strategies provide a balance of 
skills and knowledge that prepare our children for their future. 
 
 
Green Valley takes pride in its reputation for providing a positive, caring, and stimulating setting 
where students
 
love to learn. The staff embraces parents as our partners in preparing children to 
be the future. The collaboration, and active involvement of teachers, support staff, and parents 
form the foundation of our learning environment. We hold high expectations 
and encourage 
responsible citizenship. Children, staff, and parents model positivity and collaboration because we 
work together as a learning community. 
 
 
Green Valley is committed to empowering its staff and students with current, appropriate 
technologica
l tools. The school has created multiple outdoor educational settings to promote 
learning beyond the four walls of a traditional classroom. Our Maker's Space, enhanced science lab 
time and outdoor classroom/garden are a few of the spaces dedicated learning
 
everywhere on our 
campus. I welcome your inquiries, and if you wish to visit the campus or meet a teacher, please call 
the office for an appointment.
 
 
At Green Valley, students, parents, staff and community work together to ensure our rigorous, 
comprehens
ive, balanced and integrated educational program in a safe and caring environment. 
All children have the opportunity to develop their ability to think critically, solve problems, 
communicate effectively, work both independently and collaboratively, take ri
sks, make decisions, 
be creative and help others. With children as our priority, the staff continues to reflect on teaching 
practices, share ideas and concerns honestly, communicate regularly with parents and community, 
and model a lifelong joy of learning
 
through our own personal and professional growth. The entire 
Green Valley community believes in teaching the whole child through balanced, relevant 
curriculum in a collaborative and respectful environment.
 
 
Our goals are to provide educational experiences
 
that will:
 

 
Identify and build on student strengths
 

 
Inspire a true love of learning
 

 
Sustain academic growth of high performing students and increase achievement of 
lower performing students
 

 
Be regarded as welcoming, responsive, and inclusive of all 
students, parents, and staff
 

 
Continue to improve programs for students with special needs
 

 
Promote a safe and caring environment for all students, staff and parents.
 
The entire staff is dedicated to providing a classroom environment that promotes and 
reinforces a 
safe and orderly campus so that each student can attain his or her potential. We are the COLTS (a 
Community Of Learners who Together Succeed!)

School Profile
 
Green Valley Elementary School, established in 1952
, serves approximately 507 Transitional Kindergarten through 5th grade students 
from a variety of residential areas that include single
-
family homes and a few condominiums. Attendance is determined and established 
by school district boundaries.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of eac
h year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (
LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local pri
orities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

The students of Green Valley Elementary greatly benefit from its supportive community who volunteer in all aspects of school 
life. The school's strong 
base of parent volunteers do such things as work in classrooms, provide yard duty suppor

participate in our PTA/Learning Fund/Site Council. The school benefits from several community partnerships, including partner
ships with Chevron and 
the San Ramon Valley Education Foundation grou

need, food drives, and a yearly wheelchair drive. The cooperative leadership of staff, parents, and students is reflective of
 
the high expectations and 
st

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, 
inclusive model of professional development for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and in
structional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wid
e K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valle
y Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of inst
ructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in
 
addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learnin
g, and lesson design.

In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics
 
that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Projec
t (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framewor
k 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; 
Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment
 
strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a w
hole is enhanced.
