Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Newberry 
Springs School was originally constructed In 1938 and modernized in 1994. The campus is situated on 95 acres 
and comprised of five permanent classrooms, eight portable classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, a pre
-
school 
playground, and three lower and
 
upper grade playgrounds.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The school provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district governing board has 
adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are per
formed on a daily basis 
throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps 
keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop sanitation sc
hedules 
that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair
 
A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the District's maintenance staff on a regular basis, with heavy 
maintenance functions occurring during vacation
 
periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered 
by Silver Valley Unified School District , including regular facilities inspections, to ensure that school grounds and facili
ties 
remain in excellent repair. A work order process is us
ed when issues arise that require immediate attention.
 
 
Repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received. The chart displays the results of the 
most recent school facilities inspection, provided by the district.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for Englis
h language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked wit
h the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and t

aides,
 
teachers, and the school administrator.
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, comprehensive School Site Safely Plans have been developed for each 
site by the district. The Safety Plans are reviewed annually with the staff. Key elements of th
e Safety Plan focus on the 
following: school rules and procedures, disaster procedures, current status of school, notification to teachers, child abuse 
reporting procedures, school
-
wide dress code, routine and emergency routes, sexual harassment policy, po
licies related 
to suspension and expulsion, maintaining a safe and orderly school environment and safe ingress and egress of pupils, 
parents, and school employees.
 
 
The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to haza
rdous materials and state
