School Description
 
 
Vision Statement was 
created in 2012.
 
The vision of Mount Pleasant Elementary is to be a high achieving school and to set students on the 
path to the university.
 
 
Mission Statement was created in 2012.
 
Mount Pleasant Elementary is a diverse and dedicated community of life
-
long
 
learners. We are 
committed to the success and empowerment of students by providing access to high quality 
education, tailored instruction and educational opportunities. We strive to accomplish this in a 
responsible, safe, respectful and welcoming learning
 
environment where the needs of all students 
are met and every child learns.
 
 
History
 
Mount Pleasant Elementary School is the oldest school in the Mount Pleasant School District. It first 
opened its doors as a school house in 1865 and was then relocated in
 
1915 to the current Moose 
Lodge on Marten Ave. Our current school on Candler Ave. was built in 1955.  Our school is located 
near the eastern foothills of San Jose. The school is in an ethnically integrated residential 
community and most students live in s
ingle family homes. There are very few commercial 
establishments and no industry within the district boundaries. Our school is next to Mount Pleasant 
Park and we have access to well
-
kept public tennis courts.
 
 
Our Team
 
Mount Pleasant provides classes from 
transitional kindergarten through fifth grade. The regular 
staff includes eleven classroom teachers, half time intervention teacher, a part time music teacher, 
an English Language Development Specialist, and full time Kinder instructional aide. In addition
, the 
district provides a part
-
time psychologist, health clerk, speech therapist, and library technician. We 
also have a full time counselor provided by Diva Diversity. Special education personnel at Mount 
Pleasant includes a half time resource specialist 
teacher and a half time instructional aide. Services 
provided under the School wide Program includes Local Control Accountability Plan, Gifted and 
Talented Education (G.A.T.E.), and Title I programs. School wide funding provides additional 
services to stud
ents to improve academic achievement, computer literacy, and word processing. 
We also have mobile iPad labs and Chromebooks.
 
 
Curriculum and Instruction
 
We have a Piano Lab where the 4th and 5th grade students receive piano instruction by the 
district 
music teacher. Our students get to experience technology through our mobile labs with 
Chromebooks and iPads. We provide additional academic support to our students through an 
intervention and English Language Development (ELD) teacher, after schoo
l interventions, and 
supplemental educational services through Bay Area Tutors. We have a part time counselor and a 
part time family case manager to support our students and families. All students in 1st 
-
 
2nd 
participate in art lessons provided by the pro
fessional artist from San Jose Museum of Arts and 
students in the upper grades receive music lessons once a week in our piano lab.

The school also provides after
-
school clubs and sports such as Coding, Chess, Chinese Kenpo Karate, modern dance and ballet folkloric
o.  
Through project
-
based learning, students tackle a challenging academic curriculum in ways that are engaging, meaningful, and adaptable 
to a variety of learning styles. Our curriculum is tied to the Common Core State Standards. Report Cards are provided
 
to parents three 
times a year. Standardized test results are provided to parents in the summer with a follow
-
up interpretation of results at the fall parent 
conference. Student assessment data is gathered every year using standardized test results and int
erim assessments. Surveys of parents 
and students are collected every year to determine program needs.  We are currently in our third year of Leader in Me impleme
ntation 
where we align academics with 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.
 
 
Response to Interv
ention (RtI)
 
We identify students at risk through our RtI process and hold Student Success Team (SST) meetings with the parents, classroom
 
teacher, 
intervention teacher, counselor, principal and psychologist. We determine what the student needs are with in
put from all stake
-
holders 
and create a plan to help the student succeed.
 
 
After School Program
 
We have the Mount Pleasant After School (MPAS) program that serves over one hundred students from dismissal to 6 p.m. in grad
es 
transitional kindergarten to fif
th grade. This program provides a homework club, physical activities, enrichment and a sports program.
 
 
School Discipline
 
We are proud of our school and its commitment to quality education. We have high expectations and believe that all children c
an and wi
ll 
learn. Our discipline is fair, consistent and research based. Our school adopted the PBIS/BEST Behavior framework to model po
sitive 
behavior for our students. We promote a sense of school pride in all students by recognizing student achievement, progres
s, and student 
leadership. Our curriculum supports our school goals and makes learning transferable to life situations. We will help student
s develop a 
positive self
-
image for their unique talents and respect for others. We provide a learning environment w
here students can solve problems 
in a cooperative way and build an acceptance for their own learning and behavior. We model exemplary citizenship so children 
will have 
respect for their country and the laws that govern it. We encourage independent learning
 
and a sense of inquiry.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Contact Person: Michelle Mendoza (PTA President)
 
 
Parent involvement is a high priority at Mount Pleasant Elementary School. Processes and procedures are in place that provide
 
opportunities for parents 
to 
give input and receive information about their child's education. We have a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) that organizes f
undraising activities 
which generate funds for educational field trips, special class projects, equipment for the school, and rewar
ds and incentives for students. The principal 
holds monthly parent meeting throughout the school year. The School Site Council meets each month at 3:30 PM to oversee the S
chool Plan. Parents 
are encouraged to help in the classrooms, chaperon on field trips
, and help with special class or school projects and activities. The parents of English 
Language Learners participate in the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). Our parents participate in the District Pare
nt Advisory Committee 
through representativ
e members of the School Site Council as well as LCAP.  All parent presidents of the various school organizations are invited 
to attend 
the District Advisory and Superintendents Advisory Committee. We also work closely with the District 5 Council member to 
address community and 
safety events. You can also visit our Facebook page to see pictures and videos of previous events. Visit us at: www.facebook.

The Safe School Plan was written by a representative group of stakeholders, including school staff and co
mmunity members in consultation with law 
enforcement, to address the safety concerns identified by students, staff and the community at the four elementary school sit
es in the district. This plan 
was updated during the months of January and February in 201
7 and approved by our School Site Council on June 2017. The identified safety concerns 
were student attendance and suspensions. School climate incorporates issues related to character education and student resili
ency.
 
 
Our school incorporates the Positive 
Behavior Intervention Support System (PBIS) through the BEST program, which allows students to model positive 
behavior and be recognized for it. We have received training on PBIS and have District Wide as well as site based BEST team t
o analyze student beh
avior 
data. Our school has adopted the BEST Behavior Program where three essential rules are followed: Be Safe, Be Responsible, and
 
Be Respectful. When 
students are found breaking one of these rules, he or she is given time to think about his or her action
, then asked what the best behavior should have 
been, and how to restore the broken relationships through restorative practices.
