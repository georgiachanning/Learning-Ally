School Description
 
Oasis Elementary School is situated in the heart of the Oasis Community.  The Oasis community is 
predominately made up of farm and field laborers with a significant migrant 
population.  Most of 
our families are living at the poverty level (97.5% of students receive free and reduced lunch) and 
the vast majority of our students live in trailers.  The conditions of the trailer parks that house our 
families range from extremely p
oor to moderate.  The school building serves as the unofficial 
community center, and the facilities are not only used for school events, but also non
-
school events 
such as the FIND Food distribution and ESL classes.  Many of our students rely on the school
 
to 
provide two to three nutritious meals a day. Additionally, our students need a significant amount 
of training in social skills, which we provide with school
-
wide Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Supports.
 
 
Oasis Elementary School provides instruction
 
for students in grades TK

-

-

comprised of 97.5% qualifying for free and reduced price meals, 18% are migrant students, 8.2% 
students with disabi
lities, and 76% English Learners.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Unde
r the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific acti
vities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of

recess, administrators and playground supervisors monitor 
playground activity. The principal, assistant principal, and six yard supervisors monitor lunch time activity in the cafeteri
a and on the playground. At the 
end of the day when students are dismiss
ed, teachers, the principal, and the assistant principal monitor student behavior to ensure a safe and orderly 
departure. One yard duty supervisor is stationed in the parking lot after school to supervise traffic and assist students in 
the afternoon when t
he late 
buses are preparing for departure. The principal and assistant principal are also present in the parking lot to assist with s
upervision and traffic safety.
