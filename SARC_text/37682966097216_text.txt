By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The picture that is drawn of Chaparral Elementary School seems lifted from a Norman Rockwell painting.
 
 
Our school is an 
award winning National Blue Ribbon, National School of Character, and California Distinguished School perched on a sunny 
hil
lside in Poway, California, amid a residential neighborhood overlooking the San Diego suburb of Rancho 
Bernardo.
 
 
Chaparral Elementary School is a highly industrious gathering place!
 
 
Each week, our campus is alive with 
legions of volunteers, committed pro
fessionals, hardworking support staff, and enthusiastic students.
 
 
Our school boasts 
one of PUSD's largest forces of parent and community volunteers.
 
 
Our school annually logs an average of 15,000 volunteer 
hours according to PTA data collected over the pa
st five years.
 
 
Chaparral has over 800 students from preschool, critical 
skills classrooms, and transitional kindergarten through fifth grade, walk or drive in from the neighboring areas of Rancho 
Bernardo and Poway.
 
 
During the week, our Extended Student 
Services program opens at 6:30 a.m. and closes
 
at 6:00 p.m. 
each evening and supervises the District's largest ESS program with
 
over 200
 
students enrolled.
 
 
Our preschool classes 
meet each day to instruct more than twenty
-
two children in a parent
 
participa
tion program aimed at preparing our 
children for success in kindergarten and beyond. Chaparral
 
is a nationally recognized and award winning institution 
meeting the diverse needs of a large and motivated student body.
 
 
As envisioned, these predicted accompl
ishments are 
guided annually through the shared leadership of Chaparral's dedicated teachers, staff, principal, and 
community.
 
 
Together, we work hand
-
in
-
hand to foster in each child a passion to learn using enriched curriculum, 
researched best practices, 
and technological advances.
 
 
Our school goals are to increase student responsibility for 
individual behavior and to promote academic excellence for all students. Chaparral is a district leader in integrating 
character education throughout our academic curr
iculum.
  
Our Chaparral mission
 
statement captures the essence of what 
we value.
 
"The students, parents, and staff of Chaparral Elementary School create a positive and productive environment 
that instills in each child, strength of character, a sense of com
munity, and love of learning."
 
 
Teachers teams have been 
trained in Responsive Classroom, a program highlighted on the federal list of best practices for character 
education.
 
 
Chaparral Elementary is mentioned in the nationally published Responsive Classro
om brochure as a "success 
story" in the implementation of the model.
 
 
In our classrooms, one can observe strategies such as morning meetings, 
academic choice, and cooperative structures to teach and support appropriate social development and academic 
achie
vement. A wide range of programs and support services have been developed to enhance student achievement and 
character development at Chaparral. Examples of these support service groups include the following: Art's Attack

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend clean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.7
5(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are giv
en the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A
 
night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the district offic
es.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Chaparral's professional teams and administration value the opinions, expertise, and devout volunteerism found within 
Chaparral's community and welcome involvement in decision making through Parent Teacher Association (PTA), School 
Site Council (SSC), and 
Foundation (CEF)
 
participation. Our Foundation, in concert with our PTA and SSC, allocates 
resources to support student achievement.
 
 
The Chaparral Foundation's mission statement is "to enhance the quality of 
our children's education by supporting technolo
gy and resources at Chaparral"
. 
To determine those needs and how to 
fund them, the PTA, the Chaparral Site Council, CEF, the administration, and the teachers continue to collaborate on how 
to enhance our children's educational experience.
 
 
These needs chan
ge every year based on state and district fund 
disbursements. To date the Foundation has purchased a new computer lab,eighty
-
five iPads, two hundred chromebooks, 
thirty
-
four apple tvs, twenty
-
four doc
-
u
-
cams and twenty
-
four LCD projectors. In addition, six
 
portable handheld "slates" 
have been provided to accompany document cameras.
  
They procured two new printers (located in the office and library 
for use by all staff), purchased Brain
-
pop and Brain
-
pop Jr., one
-
hundred new quizzes for the Reading Counts Pr
ogram, 
and they funded Art's Attack for the entire school year.
 
 
Foundation also funded the opening of our Innovation Lab, where 
students experience hands on lessons tied to Next Generation Science Standards.
 
 
To quote the year end report,
 
 
"The CEF 
has al
ready made a difference this year in your child's school day.
 
 
We will continue to strive for collaboration from 
teachers, administrators and parents to provide the educational enhancements needed to prepare our children for future 
challenges." The Chaparr
al PTA supports school enrichment through the funding of a PE instructional assistant, a music 
teacher, teacher supply accounts, grants, assemblies, Family Fun Nights, library books, Character Counts, Reflections 
Programs, Olympic Field Day, and Fitness Cl
ub.
 
 
A Chaparral volunteer leads Melody Makers and provides Chaparral 
students first through fifth grade with an extra outlet for singing and performing as a group and individually. The SSC 
monitors the Chaparral vision, school
-
wide goals and strategic pla
n each year.
 
 
The SSC allocates funds in support of 
student achievement and intervention for at
-
risk students.
 
 
This year the SSC voted to support our ELL students by using 
EIA funds to provide two impact teachers for our primary grades.
 
 
This impact teach
ers will provide support and 
remediation in the area of literacy, using Read
-
Well and SIPPS, both researched based curriculum.
 
 
Parents participate in 
classrooms by working with individual students and small groups and by teaching whole
-
group lessons.
 
 
Pro
grams such as 
Art Attack, where parents are trained to instruct children in the styles of the great Art Masters, and Character Counts, 
consisting of volunteers who support teachers to integrate Character Education into academic lessons, are supporting 
stud
ent success in the arts and social development.
 
 
Volunteers also assist in the library, our school garden and the 
innovation lab.
