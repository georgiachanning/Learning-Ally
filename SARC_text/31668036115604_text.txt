About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every sc
hool in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local 
educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additio
nally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://w
ww.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 19,
 
2019, and determined that each school within the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the 
State of California. All 
students, including English lear
ners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8 each student receives a textbook available to keep at home and has a class set o
f textbooks to use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eight. Instructional materials are
 
adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are
 
reviewed by all teachers 
and a recommendation is made to the Schoo
l Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district office, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The ta
ble displays information ab
out 
the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used in the school.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension 
rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Silverado Middle School. The school is always in compliance with the law
s, rules, and 
regulations 
pertaining to emergency preparedness, hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.  The school's disaster preparedness
 
plan includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, emergency drills, lockdown/barricad
e, secure school, and earthquake drills are conducted with 
staff and students throughout the school year. Information is communicated to staff through staff meetings and written commun
ication. The School Site 
Safety Plan was reviewed and was approved in Fe
bruary 2019 by the School Site Council. Annual review is scheduled for February 2020 including a 
consultation with the local police department contact for a review of the school's safety plan.
 
 
Throughout the year, a number of initiatives, assemblies and o
ngoing programs educate students about bullying and ensuring a positive campus 
environment. School goals are written to monitor and assess the school's positive environment. Staff, counselors and administ
rators provide student 
services that enable students
 
to have a connection to a caring adult on campus. Students are supervised before and after school by certificated 
staff/administration. During the school day, a caring, competent and well informed team of campus supervisors monitor student
s during lunch, 
in 
between classes and after school.  There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. Visitors must sign in at the 
front office using our 'Raptor' 
visitor identification system when visiting the school and indicate the reason for their visit. 
In addition, volunteers must complete the volunteer 
application form which is reviewed by administration and it is kept on file for the year.
