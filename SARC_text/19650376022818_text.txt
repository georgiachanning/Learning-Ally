About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
McKibben School has 17 classrooms (including o
ne portable classroom), a multipurpose room, a library/ resource room, and an administration building. 
The main campus was built in 1961. A new restroom building was constructed in 2001. The classrooms underwent modernization in
 
2004.  Following 
that, the 
multipurpose room underwent a facelift. The library media resource room was completed and opened in the 2007

2008 school year. It was 
updated in 2009. We are pleased that we have a new air conditioning unit in our Multi
-
purpose room, with new floors and wi
ndows as well. We are 
proud to have a 35 station computer lab for intervention, technology standards, and enrichment as well as 40 portable laptops
.  As you can see, 
technology is a key focus at McKibben.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repair
s necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. A district

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 20
19
-
20)
 
McKibben school site has parent representatives who participate in various district
-
level advisory committees. District
-
level parent involvement 
opportunities include participation in District Advisory Council (DAC), and the English Learner Advisory
 
Committee (ELAC.) Parents at McKibben School 
are encouraged to attend the district
-
wide Parent Education Classes offered throughout the year.
 
 
In addition, our Cub families participate in a variety of events such as Harvest Festival, Trunk or Treat, Winte
r Program, Family Dances, Title 1 Parent 
meetings, Smarter Balance test preparation meetings,  and other school and PTA sponsored family events. Parents can volunteer
 
at home or in classrooms 
to assist with the preparation of educational materials, as room
 
parents, and accompany classes on field trips. The McKibben PTA has many dedicated 
parents who volunteer many hours for the students. Our Site also offers 9 weeks of classes in which parents attend PIQE (Pare
nt Institute for Quality 
Education) and learn e
ffective collaboration techniques between home and school, build understanding on how to support instruction in the home, and
 
learn to navigate high school A
-
G requirements, how to foster an attitude for success in elementary school that will continue on i
nto high school and 
college, as well as requirements for college admission and financial aid.  We are lucky to have parents that spend time on ou
r campus daily and are very 
visible; from helping direct traffic to sight word practice during recess times. Pa
rents receive messages through AERIES communications, reminders and 
photos through our school
-
wide Class Dojo app, and vital school information through the annual Parent Handbook on our school website, our brand new 
digital marquee, monthly calendars and n
otices that are sent home regularly.
 
 
The McKibben School Site Council meets regularly to review the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, and to execute the responsibilities of the council 
for the school. All parents are invited and welcome to attend meeti
ngs. The school also has regular meetings for the English Language Learners Advisory 
Council (ELAC). Our PTA meets every month of the 4th Thursday of the month and meetings are open to all community members.  P
arents also meet 
once a month for coffee with 
the Principal in which the forum is a casual open dialogue where questions and clarifications are the norms.
 
 
Our Community Liaison extends the relationship between home and school by being available for questions and concerns; both in
 
English and Spanish.
  
She holds parent involvement activities such as Family Stories, informational meetings that address topics like understanding
 
test results and how to 
support their children at home with homework and additional practice, as well as facilitates the approva
l process for school volunteers.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
As required by law, McKibben maintains a detailed safety plan. Personnel is trained in emergency procedures and students take
 
part in regularly 
scheduled emergency drills. Food, water, 
medical and other emergency supplies are updated annually to ensure that our campus is ready to respond in 
the event of an emergency or disaster. The McKibben School
-
wide Discipline Plan, which includes emergency provisions, is reviewed annually and 
update
d as needed.  Parents and staff members contribute to revisions and updates to the plan. In classrooms and during information
al assemblies 
throughout the school year, staff reviews both the safety and emergency components with the students. Parents are inf
ormed through AERIES 
communications, our school
-
wide Class Dojo app, Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter), the annual Parent Handbook, the digital marquee, 
and monthly calendars and notices that are sent home regularly.
 
 
The school campus is car
efully monitored before, during, and after school hours by school staff and district staff. Break periods and lunch are super
vised 
by school personnel. Our school has alarm systems monitored by a security company, a camera monitoring system, and a doorbell
 
access system that is 
monitored by office staff. Digital check
-
in and check
-
out procedures are also strictly enforced at the campus. All adults are required to wear an 
identification badge that is visible to others. The district maintains positive relatio
nships with law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of all 
campuses. Furthermore, through Measure W funding (a general obligation bond passed by area voters to upgrade school facilitie
s) all schools have 
upgraded communication systems and two
-
way rad
io communication at all times. Each classroom has a telephone the school
-
wide public address system

McKibben has taken a Back to Basics approach to instruction to ensure that all teachers are utilizing best practices, work to
 
refine their teaching skills 
and extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. One 
member of each grade level participates in the McKibben Instructional Leadership Team; in 
which these teachers are able to focus on teaching strategies, best practices and improving instruction for all students. All
 
teachers participate in bi
-
monthly on
-
si
te grade level meetings in which they are able to isolate specific standards and target improving instruction in that area. T
eachers are also 
afforded the opportunity to meet each trimester with teachers in the same grade across the district in order to co
llaborate on data, implementation of 
the universal screening assessment, and progress monitoring strategies as well as to perform writing calibration exercises. M
cKibben also has a 
Leadership Team in which a member of each grade level participates in meeti
ngs that focus on analyzing school data and creating a plan to meet the 
specific needs of our Cubs.
 
 
All teachers are GLAD trained and employ those strategies in order to improve English Language instruction. Our staff partici
pates in ongoing math 
training
 
and classroom observations in which they learn and refine CGI strategies and how to improve students thinking and verbalizing
 
about math and 
how math works.
 
 
Our English Language Coordinator provides monthly in
-
service opportunities to increase ELL instru
ction, clarification of EL paperwork and district 
expectations as well working toward bi
-
literacy and possible reclassification.

In order to build a sense of community, the entire campus participates in the House System in which all st
udents, grades Tk
-
6, and all staff members are 
a part of one of 4 House groups. House groups are led by staff members, noon aides assist with supervision, and parent volunt
eers attend events in order 
to further assist with supervision.  The entire school p
articipates in weekly competitions by wearing their House color every Wednesday and accumulating 
spirit points.  Monthly rotations are also held in which students are engaged in team building activities, fun group games, a
nd opportunity to eat with 
student
