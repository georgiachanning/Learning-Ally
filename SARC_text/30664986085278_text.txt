By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Plavan is a vibrant school and home to a diverse community of 525 TK through 5th grade students. Our student body

successful academically and socially when provided with the appropriate supports. Our goals and resources are centered 
on high expectations that focus on the potential of each child.
 
 
To ensure success for ALL students, our school programs
 
are data
-

and needs. Teachers collaborate in Professional Learning Communities to analyze state and local assessment results, which 
enables them to identify student needs and plan for effective, differ
entiated instruction and interventions. From project
-
based learning to guest speakers and field trips, our students are provided with rich educational experiences that prepare 
them for success in the classroom and the greater world beyond.  Equally importa
nt, our teachers take time to know each 
individual student and learn more about personal strengths and interests in order to inspire a love of learning, confidence 
in their abilities and positive relationships with others. We focus on the development of th
e whole child through social 
emotional support based on a growth mindset.
 
 
Academic excellence at Plavan is reflected in our student results from many metrics including the Smarter Balance 
Assessment, on which 78% of all students in grades 3

Arts. We credit our success to high expectations, rigorous standards, meaningful differentiated curriculum, a nurturing 
environment, and a strong home
-
school connection.
 
 
The vision of the Plavan Community, wh
ich consists of students, teachers, support staff, and parents are committed to 
creating a learning environment that educates the mind and the heart of every child.

given opportunities to be successful to the best of their abilities,

Take ownership and responsibility for teaching and learning,
 

 
Share in critical thinking, communicati
on, collaboration, and creativity through our school
-
wide programs and 
curriculum in preparation for 21st Century learning, and
 

 
Utilize technology as a learning tool for acquiring and applying information in preparation for college and career 
readiness.
 
 
S
ocially & emotionally, the Plavan community will:
 

 
Take part in a shared responsibility as we support each other as a team,
 

 
Follow our school
-
wide R.O.A.R. standards,
 

 
Foster a love of learning that focuses on the whole child,

onship between all members of our community,
 

 
Show mutual respect towards our common goal of student achievement and well

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Plavan School was originally constructed in 1972 and was thoroughly renovated between 2003 and 2005. The school is 
currently comprised of 22 permanent classrooms, a library, and a 
spacious playground.  The facility supports teaching and 
learning through its ample classroom and recreational space.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
2018
-
19 School Accountability Report Card for Urbain H. Plavan 
Elementary School
 
Page

of

Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily 
basis throughout the school year with an emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and 
staff helps keep
 
the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 
A routine maintenance program is administe

complex maintenance functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by Fountain Valley School District's Maintenance & Opera
tions Department to ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed effic
iently and in the order in which they 
are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
Deferred maintenance includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. Fountain Valley School Distr
ict did not participate in the State School Deferred Maintenance 
Budget Program. Fountain Valley School District sets aside funds each year to specifically address deferred maintenance 
needs. The passing of Measure O provided additional funds for these typ
es of projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a
 
primary focus of Plavan School. Students are supervised before/after school, during 
lunch and recess periods, by teachers, administrators, trained aides, and classified staff. All visitors to the campus must 
sign into campus through the Raptor Visitor Man

during their stay on school grounds.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. The Safety Co
mmittee reviews and updates the Safe School Action Plan each year by March 1st. Any and all 
revisions to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff.
 
 
The Goals and Objectives in the Safe School Action Plan focus on two areas
:
 
1) A school climate characterized by caring and connectedness
 
2) The safe and orderly physical environment of the school
 
 
To supplement the Safe School Action Plan, every school also has a disaster preparedness plan that includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during an emergency. Routine earthquake. fire, disaster, and lockdown drills are 
conducted on a rotating
 
basis throughout the school year.  Plavan staff participated in professional development related 
to safety during the 2019
-
20 school year.
