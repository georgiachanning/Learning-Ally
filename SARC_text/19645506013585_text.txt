About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card
 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Pla
n (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental 
Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunit
ies for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents, guardians, and community members are an integral part of the support system for Garvey School District students and 
have a multitude of ways 
in which they can get involved to contribute to student
s' educational experience.  Maintaining constant communication with the child's teacher(s), 
attending Parent/Teacher Conferences, participating in Back To School Night and Open House, staying informed through notices,
 
memos, phone calls, 
newsletters are ot
her examples of involvement.
 
 
In accordance with Title I regulations, our school jointly develops with parents a school
-
parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, 
and students will share the responsibility for improved student acade
mic achievement and the means by which the school and parents will build and 
engage in a partnership to help children achieve the State's high standards.
 
 
There are ample opportunities for parents to participate in the governance of the school by joining a
ny of the many committees such as School Site 
Council, ELAC, School Advisory Committee, and District Level Committees as well.
 
 
The purpose of the ELAC (English Learner Advisory Committee) is to advise the principal and school staff on programs and serv
ice
s for English Learners 
and the School Site Council on the development of the School Plan for Student Achievement Representatives from this group att
end monthly DAC/DELAC 
meetings facilitated by Learning Support Services.
 
 
The SSC (School Site Council) is a
 
team of the principal, teachers, other school personnel, parents, students, and community members who are elected 
that develop the mission and goals for improvement of an individual school community.  School Site Council evaluates the effe
ctiveness of the
 
school 
plan and revises it based on data collected throughout the year.  This group meets once a month.
 
 
In addition, parents can take advantage of the numerous parent workshops that are provided by Learning Support Services, held
 
at the District Parent 
C
enter (IPO) on topics from parenting, academic achievement, children's social emotional needs, to school funding.  It is alwa
ys a pleasure to welcome 
parents/guardians to student performances, student recognition assemblies, and school functions and events
.  We appreciate your support and 
partnership.
