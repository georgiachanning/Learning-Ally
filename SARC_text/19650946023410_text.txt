By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to California Elementary School 
-
 
Home of the Cheetahs!  Our mission statement: We exist to ensure all our 
students achieve at high levels of learning.  Our dedicated teachers and support staff work togethe
r and are committed 
to developing each child, socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually.  Last school year, our school was selected a
s 
a Capturing Kids' Hearts National Showcase School. In addition to welcoming students to school each day, our 
families are 
encouraged to be involved in our school community.  The academic success of every student and providing a safe and 
productive learning experience are our top priorities.  Our comprehensive educational programs focus on the school's 
mission to 
provide all students with meaningful and rigorous instruction within a nurturing, child
-
centered learning 
environment.
 
 
Our educational programs include a standards
-
aligned core curriculum, targeted reading groups for fluency and 
comprehension, i
-
Ready Rea
ding for individualized reading instruction, Achieve3000 for targeted nonfiction 
comprehension, i
-
Ready Math for targeted math instruction, and Reflex Math for math fluency.  In addition, our school 
has support services for special education, foster youth,
 
homeless youth, and English Learners. Students in need of 
specialized instruction are mainstreamed as much as possible into the general education setting per their IEP goals. The 
Special Education Teacher works collaboratively with the general education t
eachers to plan instructional opportunities 
aligned with the core curriculum. Modifications are made to make the core curriculum accessible to students. In addition, 
as appropriate, our special education students attend an Extended School Year (ESY) progra
m in the summer to help 
maintain the knowledge learned during the regular school year. The Foster Youth Liaison has welcome meetings with 
foster youth to ensure they have all the necessary resources to be successful. Moreover, she monitors their academic 
p
rogress and recommends intervention as needed to help address any achievement gaps.  We also have a program 
targeting health and fitness with our 100 Mile Running Club.
 
 
Our School Goals for 2019
-
2020:
 
 
1.  Maintain the honor of being selected as a Nationa
l Showcase School with Capturing Kids' Hearts
 
2.  Implement focused, strategic learning rotations targeting reading fluency and reading comprehension for intervention 
and/or enrichment within the school day
 
3.  Ensure high levels of professional collaborat
ion and communication using the principles of Professional Learning 
Communities (PLCs) with dedicated release time to align standards and curriculum, develop common assessments, analyze 
data results, and determine the next steps for mastery of skills and c
oncepts
 
4.  Plan and organize focused professional development to support rigorous lesson design, targeted instructional 
strategies, and best practices with school and district initiatives
 
5.  Provide all students with 1:1 technology and learning 
opportunities to support educational programs and digital literacy 
skills
 
6.  Continue to increase the number of students meeting or exceeding standards in English Language Arts and mathematics 
as measured by multiple measures including the California Asse
ssment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP)
 
7.  Maintain high levels of parent and community involvement using a variety of activities and methods of communication 
to strengthen the home/school connection

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
California Elementary School conducts monthly facility inspections. Our school facility is in good condition. The cleanliness
 
of our campus is constantly complimented on by visitors and the grounds are maintained weekly by district staff and on a 
daily bas
is by custodial staff. The safety conditions of the campus are addressed through work orders, to fix, repair, or 
replace materials.
 
 
In August 2018 our campus received updated improvements with new asphalt on our parking lot and playground areas.  
Part of 
this improvement included a shaded area for students on the main playground.  In October 2019 our back gate 
was replaced for safety. The district conducted a wireless upgrade and network upgrade (network cabinets, switches, and 
battery backups) by December
 
2019. Network improvements and new telephone systems are anticipated to be installed 
by the summer of 2020. Our campus has ongoing maintenance and repair to ensure safe and clean campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parental 
involvement is critical to student success; therefore, our teachers and staff work extremely hard to keep parents 
informed of their child's progress.  Our site works with several parent advisory committees; School Site Council, English 
Language Advisory Co
mmittee, and Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  Our PTA is actively involved in the health, safety, 
and welfare of all our students and is very supportive of the educational programs at California Elementary School.  Our 
school's PTA provides many family e
vents, programs, and activities throughout the school year giving parents the 
opportunity to be involved.  PTA sponsors study field trips and/or assemblies for all grade levels, Red Ribbon Week, Family 
Nights, Book Fairs, and other school events.  Parent W
orkshops are offered by school and district staff at different times 

academic success.  Parents are given the opportunity to evaluate th
e workshop and provide possible topics of interest for 
future parent workshops.  Parent workshop topics this year have included: Reading Comprehension with Text Evidence, 
Math Strategies, Technology Programs and Online Safety, Capturing Kids' Hearts, and t
he CAASPP Assessment Program. 
To promote parent involvement in their children's education, we have a Special Education Parent Liaison who helps 
parents navigate the special education process. We have a Foster Youth Liaison who monitors foster students and 
facilitates meetings between all the stakeholders in the child's education. Our district's unique Family Resource Center 
provides a range of services and assistance, such as tutoring, enrichment programs, and community resources.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
California Elementary School's Comprehensive Safety Plan is located in our main office and reviewed annually.  The plan 
was last reviewed and approved on December 19, 2019, by our School Site Council.  The 
safety plan was up for review and 
available at a public safety hearing on December 10, 2019, before the plan was submitted for review and approval by our 
school site council on December 19, 2019.  The plan was discussed with a 6th
-
grade student representat
ive on December 
11, 2019.  This year the site safety plan and emergency teams were discussed with staff on August 28, 2019.  As site staffing
 
may change each year, our emergency teams are revised annually. A site safety team meeting occurred on November 13
, 
2019, to discuss safety practice drills and provide input to the plan.  Our district office also conducts safety walks annual
ly.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan includes an emergency command system staffed by site employees, an evacuation map 
of the schoo
l campus, emergency references for earthquake, fire, lockdown, and armed intruder on campus. Our plan also 
includes a crisis response plan and risk assessment.  Emergency preparedness safety drills are held regularly and the record 
of drills is kept in our
 
safety plan.  This log is submitted annually to our district office.  The key elements of our plan focus 
on earthquake awareness and preparedness, fire safety, evacuation area for student safety and supervision, lockdown 
and/or intruder responses, and com
munication during an emergency.  Every room at California Elementary is equipped 
with a lockdown kit, red emergency bag with supplies, and red clipboard with documents for quick reference during an 
emergency.  Our students and staff report feeling safe on 
our campus as measured on our annual Climate Survey and our 
school has also been selected as a National Showcase School with Capturing Kids' Hearts.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Funds from our Supplemental Concentration (SC) and Title 1 allocations support programs and services for our significant 
subgroups, special populations, and parent involvement.
 
 
English Learners:
 
Students identified as English Learners (ELs) take the 
English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC).  In 
addition to these scores, student data from multiple measures are monitored to ensure academic achievement.  English 
Learners also receive daily English Language Development (ELD) instruc
tion for 30 minutes.  Our EL Coordinator trains 
staff on strategies to support our English Learners, oversees the documentation and progress of students in our EL 
program, and communicates with parents of English Learners to ensure their involvement.
 
 
Inte
rvention:
 
California Elementary School offers additional assistance to students struggling to meet grade
-
level standards.  Small 
group support is offered during the instructional day as well as Saturday Schools for attendance recovery and after
-
school 
tuto
ring.  Classroom teachers monitor student data, and when students are not making adequate progress with classroom 
accommodations and supports, students are referred for a Student Success Team (SST) meeting to document progress, 
create goals, and develop ac
tions to help support individual students and as needed refer for psychoeducational 
assessment.
 
 
Special Education:
 
Students with special needs are accommodated with a variety of services in the least restrictive environment. The school 
psychologist and ed
ucational specialists work together with classroom teachers and parents to design supports for 
students.  Based on eligibility for special education services, the team develops an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for 
students with learning, emotional, socia
l, and/or developmental disabilities.  The IEP defines the individualized instruction 
a student will receive, which may include sessions with an Educational Specialist, services in a special education class, 
speech and language services, and/or further spe
cialized support services. Our site also has a Special Education Parent 
Liaison to support parents who have children in our special education program.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education/Enrichment:
 
The Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program is offered to
 
students in grades three through six who have met 
eligibility through district criteria.  Students in the GATE program receive in
-
class differentiated instruction and/or optional 
assignments/projects as made available through the classroom teacher.  Stude
nts may also participate in additional after
-
school enrichment activities as organized through our GATE Coordinator.
 
 
Foster/Homeless Youth:
 
Supports for foster and homeless youth may include small academic support groups depending on individual academic 
n
eeds and resources made available through our Family Resource Center.  Our Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA) is 
our site liaison for foster and homeless youth.  She is available to support the student and family and meets annually with 
our students/fami
lies to develop a plan of support and make connections for resources as available.  In addition, our site 
administrator and TOSA have a monthly check
-
in with the students who are in foster care or in a homeless situation to be 
sure the student feels safe a
nd connected at school.

All professional development at California Elementary School revolves around the California State Frameworks, the 
integration of the California State Standards, and the implementation of district and school initiatives.  Teachers, 
administration, and suppo
rt staff participate in a variety of professional development activities. Annually teachers and 
support staff are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, 
and methodologies. Every Wednesday is a
 
shortened day, allowing teachers to attend regularly scheduled staff 
professional development.
 
 
Teachers and the administrator review achievement data (state assessments, district benchmarks, classroom 
assessments, and intervention data) to determine the 
focus for site professional development.  The site principal 
completes learning walks (classroom visits) regularly and opportunities are provided for staff to reflect and share out on 
best teaching practices.  Teachers are supported with coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, and PLC release time.
 
 
The focus for staff professional development for the last three years has included:
