Vision Statement
 
Mar Vista Elementary School staff believes that a successful school experience for every child is 
both a right and a 
necessity, and is the primary goal and responsibility of all. It is our belief that 
students can and will excel in an environment that is tailored to their evolving needs, and conducive 
to all facets of the learning environment. It is due to this belief th
at we have been able to 
successfully develop a comprehensive educational system that celebrates and promotes ethnic and 
cultural diversity, individuality, and emotional, intellectual, and social success. We strive to provide 
students with not only the stim
ulation and encouragement to succeed but the means to do so as 
well.
 

 
All Mar Vista Elementary School students will be prepared to meet the social and 
academic demands that the future holds for them.
 

 
Acquiring knowledge only will not suffice 

 
they will nee
d the skills of learning how to 
acquire knowledge as a result of the exponential increase of information.
 

 
Ongoing evaluation of the educational programs is a key component at Mar Vista 
Elementary School. Data is analyzed to guide classroom instruction.
 

 
The
 
principal and Leadership Team guide a coordinated plan to facilitate articulation 
within and across grade levels.
 

 

curriculum will include horizontal, as well as vertical a
lignment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains informat
ion about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 
intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC require
ments, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 10, 2019, and confirmed that each school with
in the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standa
rds
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the te
xtbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers a
nd a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
m
aterials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standard

ials at the school.

School Facil
ity Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Mar Vista Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is situated on
 
nine acres. School facilities 
were built in 1951, with additions built 
in 1955, 1958, and 2002. They span 44,600 square feet and include 25 permanent classrooms, four portable 
classrooms, grassy playfields, and a blacktop playground.
 
The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playgrou
nd space, and a staff resource room. Recent modernizations 
to the campus include re
-
wiring of the internet to four lines per classroom. The chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspe
ction.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
Mar Vista Elementary S
chool provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district governing board has adopted cle
aning 
standards for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school yea
r with an emphasis on 
classrooms and restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The principal works daily with three 
full
-
time custodians to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and 
functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
At the time this report was published, 100% of restrooms on campus were in good working order. Graffiti is removed immediatel
y and damage to school 
property repaired prior to the arrival of students 
on campus whenever possible. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes r
oofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or e
xterior painting, and floor systems. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, the district allocated $500,000 in funds for the deferred 
maintenance program.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessmen
ts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Univers
ity of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Pupil suspension rates;

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Parents and community members are welcomed to the school. We ask that anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours noti
f
y staff ahead of 
time. Mar Vista Elementary School is a closed campus. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear identification badges 
while on school grounds. 
During lunch, breaks, and before and after school teachers, instructional aides and noon 
duty assistants monitor the campus to ensure student safety.
 
 
The state requires all schools to develop a School Safety Plan. Components of the School Safety Plan include the following: c
hild abuse reporting 
procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pu
pils procedures; disaster response procedures; procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; 
sexual harassment policy; suspensions and expulsion policies; crime assessment; dress code; and safe schools policy.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan is u
pdated annually. The plan makes provision for dealing with a wide variety of emergency situations. The plan was designed 
to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The p
lan is upd
ated and 
reviewed with school staff annually in August.
