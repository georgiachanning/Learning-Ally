Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
It is always a pleasure to report on the activities and services that help our young Lions in learning, growing, and achievin
g.  
Our school's namesake, Mr. Sing Lum, was
 
a lifelong resident of our area, former school board member, and at the age of 
70, set national senior division records in the 100 and 200
-
meter dashes.  Sing Lum Elementary endeavors to extend the 
example set by him to our students through community serv
ice and encouraging each child to do their personal best.
 
 
Sing Lum Elementary School, established in 1984, is located in the southwest section of Bakersfield in the Campus Park 
Area.  The school is bordered by District Boulevard on the south, Chaney Lane 
on the west, Carvalho Street on the north, 
and Campus Park South on the east. The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) was established by Proposition 98, an 
initiative passed by California voters in November 1988.  The SARC, to be issued annually by lo
cal school boards for each 
elementary and secondary school in the state, provides for parents and other interested people, a variety of information 
about the school, its resources, its successes, and the areas in which improvements are needed.
 
 
Our mission
 
is to intentionally inspire success in all learning environments each day for every student as we strive to meet 
the social, emotional, and academic needs of the children that we serve. A standards
-
based curriculum and sound 
assessment strategies provide 
the foundation for continuous improvement of student performance and school programs.  
Students will leave Sing Lum Elementary School with a positive attitude toward learning, a strong foundation in basic skills,
 
and the ability to meet future academic cha
llenges.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sing Lum Elementary School provides a safe and clean l
earning environment. A scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained to promote achievement and 
wellness. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed Califo
rnia Building and Safety Codes. The 

grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the facility is fenced for student protection and safety. A t
eam of custodians 
ensures classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized, and secured at 
the end of each school day. In addition to scheduled maintenance and quick responses from the District when issues 
regardi
ng facilities arise, Sing Lum Elementary was recently reconstructed. Staff, students, and families now benefit 
tremendously from the carefully planned/executed reconstruction and modernization efforts.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The physical, social, and emotional well being of the students we serve is a top priority for the staff of Sing Lum Elementar
y 
School. Our Safe School Plan is designed and reviewed consistently to address cultural diversity and sensitivity, challenging
 
lif
e experiences, health concerns, student and family needs, crime, and safe practices. Our Safe School Plan is reviewed 
by staff and parents annually.
 
 
As outlined in our Safe School Plan, concerns for the safe arrival and dismissal of students have been add
ressed. Students 
are carefully supervised on a secure campus from 7:50 AM to 3:15 PM. Staff members wear identification badges and 
guests register in the office and wear a visitor badge. Staff and students are trained to be prepared for emergency 
situation
s and emergency protocols are practiced throughout the year. A positive relationship is maintained with law 
enforcement.
 
 
Sing Lum establishes guidelines to provide students with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school experience.  
Appropriate behav
ior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives as well as assertive discipline and conflict 
resolution tools to further develop personal growth and resilience.  Suspensions and expulsions occur only when required 
by law or when all other alte
rnatives are exhausted.
