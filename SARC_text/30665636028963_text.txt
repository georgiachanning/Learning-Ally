School Description
 
At 
Ladera Palma, we are extremely proud of our spectacular Dual Immersion Program. It was 
established in 2014 and has grown yearly!  We now are able to offer Dual Immersion TK to 5th 
grades on one campus. Our Dual Immersion (DI) offers native Spanish speakers
 
and native English 
speakers an opportunity to maintain and develop their first language while acquiring native
-
like 
communication and literacy skills in a second language. The Dual Immersion Program follows a 
90:10 model that focuses on Spanish Immersion 
first with sequential bilingual/bi
-
literate skills 
acquired in English. English is added to the curriculum incrementally so that by fifth grade, students 
are receiving instruction for 50% of the day in both English and Spanish until Eighth grade.  Dual 
Imm
ersion staff is committed to continue to incorporate Visual and Performing Arts, Project Based 

we have also opened the first TK Dual Immersion program in ou
r surrounding area!
 
 
Our program's vision is "To inspire and model multi
-
lingual, multi
-
literacy, and multicultural values 
so that we contribute to a positive and more accepting global community". We will accomplish this 
through: Explore, Commit, Take 
Action and Celebrate/Empower.  We aligned our program's 
foundation with the Three Pillars of Dual Language Education. As well, our school goals are aligned 
to these tenets. The first goal is that our students achieve bilingualism and bi
-
literacy. Our goal 
is 
for all of our students to be able to speak, understand, read and write in both languages. Our second 
goal is that all of our students reach high academic achievement levels in both languages. We 
measure and monitor our students' skills continuously, us
ing assessments in both languages.  Our 
third and final goal is that all of our students are able to develop cross
-
cultural competence skills 
and understanding. Through culturally responsive instruction and curriculum, we explore various 
cultural celebrati
ons and education, focusing specifically on the culture of Latin America.
 
 
To reach these goals, it is very important that the entire school work as a team. The Ladera Palma 
staff demonstrates a deep commitment to working as a united Professional Learning 
Community 
(PLC).  To this end, our teachers meet regularly to discuss student achievement; plan 
collaboratively; follow professional lines of inquiry to further their professional learning; and work 
collaboratively to review and revise instructional plans 
and goals. Additionally, our teachers 
exemplify being life
-
long learners as they continuously search for effective instructional pedagogy 
and support research to further our goals as a Dual Immersion school.
 
 
Our school is also committed to empowering and 
engaging our students' families and community. 
Our students can succeed in a community that supports and nurtures their quest for a multi
-
lingual, 
multi
-
literate and multicultural education.  To this end, our staff works diligently in collaboration 
with ou
r parents to create an academically and culturally
-
rich learning environment. Parents are 
offered a variety of opportunities to become involved in their school through volunteering, 
community events, parent education classes, clubs and through our PTA. We 
realize the power of 
working collaboratively with our families to augment our students' education. Additionally, we 
work closely with our community institutions to provide support or extension opportunities for our 
students and their families.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of
 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formu
la (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local
 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, par
ents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

to provide support in Spanish and 
English for all students. Title I funds also pay for part of our library tech 
salary, shared with the District.  Conferences and professional 
development opportunities for Dual Immersion professional learning are 
funded t
hrough Supplemental and Concentrated Funds (S&C).
 
 
The remainder of our Title I funding is spent throughout the school year to 
support staff
-
development related issues, supplemental materials to 
support our curriculum and instruction, and parent involvemen
t activities. 
Our PTA provides fundraising activities that support field trips and other 
educational opportunities for our students through the annual jog
-
a
-
thon 
and other fund
-
raising activities.
 
 
The majority of our general school budget goes toward teac
her salaries 
and benefits.

2019 which certifies as required by Education Code §60119 
(1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provid
ed to all students in the district, including English learners, to the extent that each pupil has a 
textbook or instructional materials or both to use in class and to take home; and (2) that sufficient textbooks and instructi
onal materials were provided

Each year the District looks at student achievement data along with 
teacher requests for specific trainings to determine the plan for the four 
Districtwide professional development days.  In 2017
-

on new English Language Arts adoptions,
 
Wonders and Amplify and for 
Ladera Palma, in Maravillas in Spanish.  In 2018
-
2019 training focused on 
new Mathematics adoptions, Bridges and Math Links.  In 2019
-
2020, 
training focused on developing Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS).
 
 
In addition to 
the Districtwide trainings, each site works with a consultant 
from InnovateEd to develop Cycles of Inquiry around their strategic focus.  
Teacher leaders attend seven days of training to analyze student data, 
develop a strategic focus for the year, impleme
nt evidence based lessons, 
and analyze student work.  Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) 
assigned to each site work with all teachers throughout the year during the 
school day and during PLC time to support implementation of the strategic 
focus.

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Ladera Palma offers a variety of opportunities for parents to be involved in the life of our school. Many family and communit
y members volunteer through 
the PTA, as classroom helpers, fu
ndraising, bi
-
monthly coffee with the principal, Community Read Aloud Days, Read Across America Activities, Field Day, 
and by participating as decision makers in School Site Council and English Learners Advisory Committee. These governing bodie
s work with 
the 
administration to help make financial decisions. We use a schoolwide reading incentive program (Ladera Palma Reads) to involv
e parents in reading with 
their children every night throughout the school year.
 
 
In addition, we invite parents to attend our 
Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall and Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences in October 
and February. Additionally, our community liaison organizes a variety of parent education classes such as Nutrition Classes, 
Positive Discipline classe
s, 
and other areas identified by parents as a need through our parent surveys.  We also offer parent clubs. Currently, we offer 
a Garden Club, Art Club,

School Safety Plan
 
In compliance with state law, Ladera Palma has a Safe Schools Plan that is revised annually in the fall. The goals of the pla
n include providing all students 
and staff members with a safe 
teaching and learning environment, safe and secure travel to and from school, and making available district programs and 
approved community resources to students and parents. The plan includes procedures for emergencies and exit routes. This plan
 
is review
ed by the staff 
and School Site Council annually. The staff has a copy of the plan in their staff handbook. We practice fire drills monthly, 
earthquake drills quarterly, and 
lockdown drills several times a year. In addition, we conduct a full disaster dril
l that includes mock scenarios.  Emergency supplies are kept on site. Our 
district personnel make inspections of our playground equipment regularly. Parents also send in emergency care kits for our s
tudents.
 
 
The school provides an educational environment 
and we implement a Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system on campus. We also 
support a school culture where students, parents, staff, and community members effectively communicate in a manner that is re
spectful to all cultural, 
racial, 
and religious backgrounds. Visitors are required to check in and wear a badge while on campus.
