EWelcome to the 2019-2020 school year! I 
am Farnoosh Aguilar and it is an honor to be 
leading Buford as your school principal. I look 
forward to working alongside the parents, 
teachers, staff and community members to 
ensure that our students are provided with an 
exceptional educational experience at Buford 
Elementary. My goal is that all students leave 
Buford prepared for middle school and beyond 
but also prepared to be well-rounded citizens 
of this world. It is important that students not 
only master the academics but also develop 
socially and emotionally so that they can take 
on all their future endeavors with responsibility 
and confidence.Our amazing Buford staff puts a great deal of 
effort and emphasis into assuring that all of our 
students are prepared for college and career 
by using the California State Standards to plan 
for a rigorous curriculum. We also make sure 
that students at all levels are able to access the 
instruction. We are continually bringing in new 
programs and technology at Buford to provide 
our students with the necessary skills for the 
21st century. This year we are expanding our 
Spanish/English Dual Language Program in 
kindergarten through fourth grade to prepare our 
students to become world citizens by instilling 
in them the value of biliteracy. We are also 
proud of our innovative fourth and fifth grade 
School of Engineering in which teacher and 
engineer will work side by side to develop 
students™ skills in problem solving, designing 
and creating through the use of science, math 
and technology. This is a unique experience 
for our Buford students!As a principal, I understand the importance of 
a parents™ role in ensuring student success. 
By working together as parents, teachers, 
administrators, staff and community members, 
we can provide a great educational experience 
for our Buford students. I encourage you to 
become involved by  attending school meetings 
and events, participating in our parent education 
classes, becoming a member of School Site 
Council (SSC) and the English Learner 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), or becoming 
a parent volunteer in the classroom or at our 
Parent Center.
I am looking forward to a wonderful school 
year and I am excited to be a part of all the amazing things that our Buford Bengals will accomplish in 2019-2020!Sincerely,
Farnoosh Lashkari Aguilar

discipline policies are founded upon the 
district™s assertive discipline model which 
clearly defines unacceptable behavior and 
consequences for poor conduct. Teachers 
integrate Character Counts and Dr. Olweus™ 
Bullying Prevention program strategies to 
promote respect and responsibility through 
daily instruction and activities. Teachers have 
established individual, grade appropriate 
classroom management plans in accordance 
with assertive discipline policies; these plans 
are submitted for approval by administrators 
each year. Concentrations are placed in 
redirecting behavior, allowing students to take 
responsibility for their actions and demonstrate 
self-control through good decision-making 
practices.At the beginning of the school year, a 
disciplinary assembly is held and each 
family is provided with a parent handbook 
which outlines school policies, safety rules 
and behavior expectations. Teachers
