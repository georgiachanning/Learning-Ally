By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students qualify for the free and reduced lunch program. Although student mobility hovers around 10%, th
e staff, 
students, and community are close and cohesive, accentuating high academic and behavioral expectations. The school 
building has more than ample size for the number of students and is situated on seven scenic acres. Students share a 
homeroom and br
eak into small group sizes, with an average of 2 students per group. The student to instructional adult 
ratio is 2 to 1. Current standard based texts, material, and supplies are sufficient for promoting a quality education for th
e 
students. 
 
 
The goal of S
eiad Elementary is to meet the individual needs of each child every day. Due to the multi
-
graded classroom, 
students are easily integrated into the appropriate academic situation. Small group settings further facilitate individualize
d 
instruction. Attendan
ce is good. Discipline and behavioral problems are negligible. Staff and students look forward to 
school each day. 
 
 
The instructional staff consists of one highly qualified teacher and two part
-
time instructional aides. Additional staff 
include Chief Busi
ness Officer, part
-
time cook, custodian and maintenance person. The staff is positive, hard working and 
has a close relationship with parents and all students.

respo
nsible citizenship

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Parents/guardians are always encouraged to participate in their 
children's learning, whether as volunteers in the 
classroom or as field trip volunteers. Parents/guardians are a valued part of our learning community, and all 
parents/guardians are invited to actively participant in our Parent Site Council which meets dur

discuss topics pertaining to their children.
 
 
Seiad Elementary maintains a Site Council committee which includes staff, parent/guardians and community 
representatives. Staff, parents/guardians and the community members collaborate tog
ether on activities, volunteer 
opportunities, holiday celebrations, safety plans and other needs or goals. The administrators present reports on student 
assessment results in reading and math. Seiad Elementary also sends individual student assessment resul
ts to their

parent/guardian is invited to attend two parent conferences each year where their child's teacher discusses student 
progress along w

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our School Safety Plan was reviewed and 
discussed with the school faculty on August 16, 2019 by Valerie Conley McIntyre 
and Marsha Jackson.
 
 
The district oversees that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained. We believe it is of supreme importance to have 
a safe and clean 
environment for all students, staff and volunteers. We have a part
-
time building custodian as well as a 
part
-
time grounds keeper to ensure classrooms, restrooms and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and in good working 
order.
 
 
The school is in complianc
e with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake
