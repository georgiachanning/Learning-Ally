Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

sufficient and go
od quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California.  The Board voted to purchase the California Core State Standards approved ELA/ELD 
in 2015

2018. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, 
in core subjects for use in the classroom and t
o take home.  Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according 
to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current 
available.  Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed b
y all teachers and a recommendation is made to the 
School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators.  All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.  The table displays 
information about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Eagle 
Mountain Elementary benefits greatly from its supportive parents who are invited to visit the classrooms at any 
time.  Eagle Mountain School Site Council offers opportunities for parent input and participation. The School Site Council 
allows increased invo
lvement with the LCFF and other school activities. Parents are encouraged to serve on  the school's 
committee and actively participate in the growth and improvement process of their student and the school. Because of 
our small size our SSC and ELAC are com
bined into a single group with staff and volunteers available to assist with 
translation when needed to help students and parents learning English feel welcome at all school functions.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Eagle Mountain 
Elementary.  The school is always in compliance with 
all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.  The School Site Safety 
plan was last reviewed and updated on January 14, 2020 by the School Safety Comm
ittee.  All revisions were 
communicated to both the classified and certificated staff.  The school's disaster preparedness plan includes steps for 
ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly bas
is throughout 
the school year.  Earthquake drills are held two times a year.  Students are supervised before, during, and after school by 
certificated staff, and classified staff supervise students during lunch and recess.  Certificated staff help with sup
ervision 
during lunch periods.  There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up.  Visitors signs are posted at all entranc
es 
to the school requiring all visitors to check in at the office to state their business and receive a visitor's pass if 
appropriate. 
Parents or community members who volunteer on a regular basis are required to have TB tests, be fingerprinted and have 
a background check.
