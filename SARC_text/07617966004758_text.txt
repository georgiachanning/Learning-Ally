By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Fairmont School, our goal is to provide high quality academic and social development in a safe, 
nurturing and familial 
environment. We want Fairmont students to be successful now and throughout their entire lives. Fairmont serves 540 
students from preschool to grade 6. In addition to the general education program, Fairmont has a variety of special 
ed
ucation programs to serve severely handicapped students including two self
-
contained special education classes, a full 
inclusion program, and the Integrating Technology and Hands
-
on Communication program (ICHAT). Fairmont students 
represent a variety of cu
ltures and ethnic groups: 34% Latino, 22% White, 12% African American, 13% Asian, and 14 % 
Tibetan. Over 39% are English Learners representing over 20 languages and 61% are eligible for free and reduced lunch.
 
 
The Fairmont School community is dedicated to
 
providing quality instruction to teach the whole child. For this reason, we 

PlayWorks program provides a full time coach to improve the health a
nd well
-
being of students by increasing 
opportunities for physical activity and safe, meaningful play. The Fairmont Afterschool Enrichment Program is coordinated 
by the city of El Cerrito. The program offers courses such as yoga, chess, music, art and danc
e. Fairmont also provides an 
Extended Day program funded by the state as well as an aftercare program through the City of El Cerrito. Through the 
district, students in grades 4
-
6 may enroll in band. The PTA provides a music program for most k
-
6 classes. Fi
fth graders 
participate in a 2
-
night outdoor education program at Pt. Bonita in the Marin Headlands. Many teachers access community 
resources to enhance their curriculum. The Watershed Project teaches students to recycle and compost. Kids for the Bay 
staff
 
collaborate with teachers to inspire environmental consciousness.
 
 
Our Learning Center strives to address student needs, specifically for our lower
-
performing students. This model allows 
us to provide targeted instruction to students as soon as they start
 
to fall behind, rather than wait until they are at least 
two years behind to qualify for special ed services. Student achievement is addressed on many different levels. Teachers 
are the first level of intervention for students who are falling behind, whil
e at the same time continuing to provide an 
interesting and rigorous curriculum for all students. English Language Development (ELD) instruction is provided daily for 
EL students to support their English learning in the core subject areas.
 
 
Our goals are:
 

 
To provide high quality academic and social development in a safe, nurturing, and community
-
based 
environment;
 

 
To provide comprehensive, student
-
centered learning and teaching experiences;
 

 
To develop and maintain productive community partnerships;
 

 
To 
emphasize collective and individual accountability.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of C
alifornia OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the hig
hest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Fairmont School has many 
opportunities for parent involvement. Parents are needed in the classroom, in the library, and 
in the schoolyard. Parents accompany classes on study trips. For these activities, parents need a volunteer badge which 
can be secured at beamentor.org. Parents 
who are not available during the day frequently help with fundraising and 
evening activities.

The School Site Safety Plan
 
guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may 
develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (
DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated 
District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school safety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A
