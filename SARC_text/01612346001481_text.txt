By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Graham was constructed in 1960 with major additions in 1961, 1964, 1991 and 2000.  Modernization in 2001 through 
2004 included restrooms, HVAC and electrical and
 
data upgrades. With the passing of the bond and Prop 39, the District 
have begun assessing all site to address concerns.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that minor maintenance, repairs or upgrades necessary to keep the school in good 
repair and 
working order are completed in a timely manner. Monthly inspections are performed which includes general, 
electrical, mechanical and playground safety. A work order system is used to ensure efficient service and emergency 
repairs are given the highest prio
rity.
 
 
The school has two full time custodians, including a senior day custodian as well as a night custodian. Custodial staff work 
year round to maintain a clean and safe school.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Graham school provides 
many opportunities for parent involvement.  The most common form of parent involvement is 
direct volunteering in classrooms.  Parents and community members read with students, help with classroom projects, 
share special talents, and attend field trips.  We
 
hold a "Morning Minute Assembly" each morning at 8:10 a.m. Parents are 
invited to attend this brief assembly for announcements about school programs and upcoming events, and the pledge of 
allegiance.  The principal holds periodic meetings with parents. Th
ese bilingual meetings provide parents with 
opportunities to learn more about school programs and supporting students at home.  In addition, teachers host annual 
parent involvement events, including Family Reading Night, Science Night, Math Night.
 
 
Our Par
ent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO) organizes a number of special events, including movie nights and one community 
potluck celebration, the Multi
-
Cultural Winter Feast.  Parents work at our Book Fairs in the fall and spring.  Parents also 
lead fundraising to be
nefit school programs and teachers' needs.  Money raised goes to support field trips, classroom 
needs, school improvements, and Sixth Grade Science Camp.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Graham
 
Elementary School reviews our safety plan annually and practices our safety procedures on a monthly basis.  
Updates to our comprehensive safety plan is completed yearly in October of the school year. Staff members review the 
updated safety plan, confirmin
g and practicing their roles. Staff at the site take emergency preparedness very seriously. 
The principal, along with the School Site Council strive to conduct safety audits yearly. In addition, Graham Elementary 
enforces arrival and dismissal procedures, 
and requires all visitors to check into the main office. Monthly fire drills, lock
-
down drills, and earthquake drills are conducted to ensure the school's preparedness for emergencies. Graham also a 
participant in the national Great Shakeout yearly earthqu
ake drill on 10/19 at 10:19 a.m.
 
 
Last school year the Site Safety Meeting was held in collaboration with the Newark Police Department on October 29th. 
We will be holding a new collaboration meeting in early Spring of 2020.
 
 
Our positive behavior focus inc
ludes the implementation of Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS). Graham 
has three school rules or expectations: Be Respectful; Be Responsible; Be Safe!  Collaborative problem
-
solving methods 
are encouraged and practiced.  Trimester certific
ates for positive behavior are given at recognition assemblies. Pawsitive 
Praise drawings are also held weekly for scholars who follow the three school rules, and winners receive a prize publicly 
at the school
-
wide Monday Morning Minute. In addition, posit
ive behavior is rewarded triennially at Lunch with the 
Principal for the Scholars of the Trimester, representing an excellent student chosen from each class school
-
wide.
 
 
An array of Graham stakeholders are trained in PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention &
 
Supports) a program which 
enhances our common focus and routines.  We are continuing to implement positive interventions as alternatives to 
traditional suspensions, whenever possible. In addition, Graham Elementary's Climate Committee focuses their effort
s 
towards building a positive and healthy social environment.  Monthly themes are established that include character traits 
that promote a safe academic environment.  Graham Elementary School also continues to implement its system of buddy 
classes.  These 
cross
-
grade
-
level connections provide the opportunity for teachers and students to work together in 
learning that helps meet the needs of a variety of age groups.  This collaboration also builds self
-
esteem and a sense of 
empowerment to students who value 
and practice mentoring and cooperation with others.

Staff Development 
days, collaboration time, release days, formal training, and observations were dedicated to the on
-
going implementation 
of Reader's & Writer's Workshop structures and Big Ideas Mathematics. Our current site goal is to increase proficien
cy for 
our targeted significant groups in English Language Arts by 10 points and in Math by 17 points, as measured by CAASPP 
(CA Assessment of Student Performance & Progress) and the California School Dashboard. Our student achievement data 
reflects the ph
enomenon of the student achievement gap, however, we have made great strides towards the benchmark 
and met many of our SPSA goals.
 
 
To counteract this, teachers attended professional training on Direct Grammar instruction and worked with an onsite 
coach th
ree years ago. During the prior two school years teachers continued to receive additional coaching support in 
Writer's & Reader's Workshop provided by West Coast Literacy. Last year we piloted a new ELD program in order to 
increase the reclassification rat
e of our English Language Learners and continue to use Leveled
-
Literacy Intervention (LLI) 
this year. As a site priority, lead teachers attended the Professional Learning Communities at Work Institute to help us 
build practices in being data
-
driven & respo
nding to the intervention needs of students. We plan for more teachers to 
attend this year. In addition, some teachers also attended a One
-
Day Workshop titled "Strategies and Structures for 
Teaching Reading and Writing" in order to learn practical ways to 
differentiate instruction through conferences and small 
groups, and how to decide which teaching structure to use for which purpose.
