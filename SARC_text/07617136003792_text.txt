Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

kn

attribute this success to a highly committed staff and community of families. Students, staff members, and parents 
perceive the school as a positive place to learn and have established high expectations for student achievement and 
beha

development program under the umbrella of CHARACTER COUNTS!Â® The dedication and expertise of staff and a 
supportive parent community provide a

Partners in Education (LPIE), provides generous financial support to all our schools.
 
 
Springhill School is an elementary school of approximately 450 students in a kindergarten through fifth grade s

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud
y.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The objective of the 
Springhill Parent
-
Faculty Club (PFC) is to make its members available to contribute to the ongoing 
school program in a variety of ways. There are countless opportunities for parents to get involved. All time spent 
volunteering enhances the education our ch
ildren are receiving. In addition to numerous PFC activities, there are 
classroom representatives that liaison with each teacher and volunteers that work directly with the students in each class.
 
 
Springhill has a very active Parent Faculty Club (PFC), whi
ch support vital programs, materials, and services. Community 
and school events abound, with parent volunteers at the center of each. Parent and community volunteers are essential 
partners in education at Springhill. A visitor at Springhill might see volun
teers working in classrooms, helping with special 
programs, tutoring individuals or groups, doing clerical work, checking books out of the library, working on fundraising 
committees, or any other needed support work around campus. The PFC at Springhill has
 
a passion for building community 
with our families. They host events throughout the year to bring families closer together: Welcome Back and Grade Level 
Coffees, Fall Family Picnic, Walkathon and Parent Education evenings.
 
 
In addition to volunteer work a
t our school, parents fund several vital school programs at Springhill in collaboration with 
LPIE. Through the efforts of an enormous volunteer cohort, the PFC and LPIE fund physical education instruction, 
supplemental instructional materials, facility imp
rovements, staff professional development, classoom aides and many 
other programs and supports. These funds are raised through school site fund raising events and the Annual LPIE ONE ASK 
Campaign.

Our School Safety and Emergency Plans are on file in the office.
 
We hold monthly drills and review safety procedures with students and 
staff on a regular basis. The plan is updated 
annually. The plan includes emergency school

School Instruction and Leadership:
 
 
District curriculum work is based on a comprehensive Three

Year Plan that was presented to the Governing Board in 
September of 2019. The plan includes 
implementation of key initiatives within the Strategic Plan and District Goals. The 
Three

Year Plan sets forth goals and priorities which serve to focus and guide the District in its instructional planning and 
align with the LCAP.
 
 
Instruction at all grade
 
levels is currently based on adopted content standards. Research
-
based instructional strategies, 
including critical thinking, the workshop model, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and differentiated 
instruction are all used in all classrooms wi
th a clear focus on meeting the academic needs of each student. Teachers meet 
regularly in grade level teams or in departments to plan and engage in professional dialogue around student learning and 
to monitor student progress. 
 
 

Council meets monthly to discuss and review all areas of the curriculum. They are also a guiding 
force in determining systemic, relevant professional development for the District. Curriculum Council grade level leaders 
organize and facilitate District
-
wide
 
grade level opportunities for articulation and planning. Administrators and teachers 
at all grade levels participate in professional development days, after school workshops and Professional Learning 
Communities to deepen and expand strategy instruction. 
Site administrators at all schools are committed to providing 
focused, aligned instructional leadership. Principals meet together monthly to discuss and plan for the implementation of 
instructional strategies based on data analysis. Professional Learning C
ommunities and department meetings engage in 
professional dialogue around student data and content areas to plan and share strategies and promote deeper 
understanding of content. We have recently adopted materials aligned to Next Generation Science Standar
ds with a focus 
on instructional practices providing understanding through rich tasks, discourse, and thinking.

Our plan recognizes that high quality professional development that impr
oves the learning of all students is: 
 

 
driven by the results of a regular and systematic analysis of a variety of data and information on student learning
 

 
focused on the effective implementation of research
-
based educational practices
 

 
responsive to the uni
que learning needs and styles of each individual educator
 

 
best accomplished through the development of collaborative learning communities whose goals are aligned 
with the priorities of the district.
 
Focus areas for professional development are based on 
assessment data, District initiatives and content standards and 
are focused on improving student achievement and deepening and strengthening teacher practice. Professional 
development also occurs at all sites in a variety of ways. Professional Learning Com
munities, book groups, peer coaching, 
demonstration lessons, after
-
school workshops, weekly K
-
5 designated meeting times and 6
-
8 grade level/department 
level meetings all provide opportunities for collaboration and professional development. Three District
-
wide professional 
development days are scheduled throughout the year providing the opportunity for collaboration and expanding and 
deepening district curriculum work.
