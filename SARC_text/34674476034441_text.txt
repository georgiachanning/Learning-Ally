By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
Guided by the Montessori philosophy and in alignment with Common Core State Standards, the mission of Cottage is to 
guide and empower each child to think critically while 
becoming an intrinsically motivated 21st century learner who 
understands their responsibility within the diverse planet through the delivery of personalized instruction in a child
-
centered environment supported by a nurturing community.
 
 
School Profile:
 
Co
ttage Elementary is one of 41 elementary/K
-
8 schools in the San Juan Unified School District and the only Montessori 
campus. Cottage Elementary School promotes the success of all students by advocating, nurturing, and sustaining an 
environment of personali
zed instruction, respect, and peace. First identified as a Title I school in the 2008
-
09 school year, 
federal resources are targeted at providing additional supports for all learners. We value the rich cultural tapestry of our 
student population and believ
e it strengthens our collaborative community. Moreover, as a Positive Behavior Intervention 
and Support (PBIS) school, Cottage students are recognized daily for their positive behavior choices. Olweus, our anti
-
bullying program, also helps guide our peacef
ul community, along with our three school rules: Show Grace, Act 
Responsibly, and Build Peace.
 
 
In the fall of 2011, Cottage School opened its first Montessori kindergarten classroom. Since then, teachers have been 
trained in the philosophy, earned their M
ontessori teaching certificates, and have built Montessori classrooms each year. 
Montessori Education at Cottage School is fully established throughout the grade levels served on campus and all of our 
teachers are accredited by either the American or Inter
national Montessori Society.  We serve students from 4 to 6 years 
old in Early Childhood (Transitional Kindergarten and Kindergarten), Lower Elementary (1st, 2nd, 3rd grade) and Upper 
Elementary (4th, 5th grade) classes.  In 2019, we have 15 Montessori cer
tified teachers, and 14 instructional assistants 
exploring, guiding, and learning in Montessori classroom environments.
 
 
The staff of Cottage School is committed to the vision of providing an environment of learning that honors each individual 
child's goal
s and dreams in a diverse community that nurtures growth, respects students, and supports families.  We 
welcome parent and community participation in building an environment where all of our children succeed and there are 
opportunities to support our child
ren through our Parent Teacher Association, parent committees such as our English 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and our School Site Council, as well as through various volunteer opportunities 
throughout the year.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2019
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing in September 2019 and determined that each school within th
e district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
a
ligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textboo
ks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materi
als are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials
 
used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/E
LD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cottage School, constructed in 1953, was modernized during the 1997 school year. Currently, there is sufficient space to 
house the student population. Site custodial staff clean the buildings along with district support fo
r major/minor repairs. 
The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emergency drills are held, and 
badges are required for all visitors and personnel. Painting of the school exterior occurred in fall 2010. Duri
ng the summer 
of 2011 the school landscaping and parking lot were renovated.  A second phase of landscaping and an upgrade to outdoor 
learning spaces occurred in the summer of 2012.  In addition, a site
-
wide low voltage upgrade was completed Fall 2013 
usin
g Measure J funds.  This included intercoms, fire and intrusion alarms.   A new monument sign was recently installed 
and stands as a warm welcome to all.  All restrooms site
-
wide have been reconfigured and renovated using Measure J 
funds.  This project inc
luded all plumbing, fixtures, partitions, floors, walls, path of travel and upgrades to meet ADA 
requirements.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning envi
ronment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. 
An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards 
and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness.
 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management 
techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of exist
ing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activitie
s.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact stud
ent 
achievement.  Annually, teachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The Distr
ict also provides a cycle of continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
i
mplementation of Common Core State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading
, Supporting Independence and Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

tion sponsor additional training opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacati
on breaks. Many teachers and administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educationa
l institutes.
 
 
What grounds the professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement da
ta, (b) staff survey data, and (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training
 
accompanies professional development in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consultin
g teachers from the Center for Teacher Support.
 
 
Paraprofessionals are encouraged to participate in professional development at the district and site level.  Specifically 
designed training is also offered to non
-
instructional support staff such as clerical
 
and custodial staff that includes both 
operational and instructional topics.
