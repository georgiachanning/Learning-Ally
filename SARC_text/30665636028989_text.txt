School Description
 
Welcome to Las Positas Elementary School, a California Distinguished School. Las Positas provides a safe, 
caring, relevant and rigorous learning environment for every child, every day. We challenge all students 
to achieve to their highest potential and bec
ome proficient in each area of the Common Core State 

the curriculum by utilizing the 4
-
C's of 21st century learning:  communication, collaboration, critic
al 
thinking and creativity through project based learning. Our  Mission Statement is: To develop inquiring, 
knowledgeable, and caring students who become active, compassionate, life
-
long learners and globally 
responsible citizens. Las Positas is a TK
-
5th g
rade school infusing the International Baccalaureate Learner 
Profile attributes and the IB Primary Years Programme of Inquiry, as we are an IB PYP Candidate School. 
Las Positas now focuses on the six transdisciplinary IB PYP themes, weaving them throughout
 
our 
curriculum, following the IB framework and philosophy. All students participate weekly in IB Spanish, IB 
Personal Social Physical Education and IB Art. Our school is focusing on the IB Learner Profile attributes, 
taught worldwide to all IB students. O
ur students are becoming caring, balanced, communicative, open
-
minded, inquiring, knowledgeable, principled, courageous learners. Our students are taking action, 
becoming global learners, and becoming global minded citizens.
 
 
As well as our IB PYP implementation as a candidate school, we are focusing on reading comprehension 
and writing schoolwide. To motivate all of our students to read, including English Learners, core learners, 
and gifted students, we use our Wonders reading
 
series as well as several reading incentive programs. 
Our Bridges math curriculum is  implemented schoolwide with success. Our school theme this year is 
"Passport to the World". Students are recognized monthly for their leadership and IB Learner Profile 
a
ttributes during our "Lion of the Month" assemblies. Our school Student Ambassadors are involved in 
planning spirit days/weeks, Dot Day, Veterans Day Assembly, Red Ribbon Week, school beautification 
days, and running the student store, along with many addi
tional opportunities to learn, design, and show 
leadership. Our goal is to offer many opportunities for all students to be leaders and display leadership 
qualities.
 
 
We utilize Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) to guide our students in th
e IB PYP Learner 
Profile attributes, celebrating success along the way. The ASES after school program, run by the Boys 
and Girls Club of La Habra, assists students with homework, exercise, and artistic endeavors. Kidzone is 
now offered at Las Positas for b
efore and after school care, partnering with our school for the success 
of all children enrolled in the program. Las Positas Academy offers several opportunities for student 
learning after school including: Spanish, Robotics, Dance, Drama, Enrichment, Reco
rders, and tutoring.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year we were able to celebrate many student accomplishments. Students 
who met their Accelerated Reader goals were invited to participate in a variety of special events. 
Students attended a movie presentatio
n, a dance assembly where they learned many different types of 
dances, outdoor game day, and a picnic in the park. We also had students in each class demonstrate 
leadership skills by implementing environmental projects, such as recycling paper, plastic and
 
cans. 
Student Ambassadors have planted and maintained a butterfly garden, began a tutoring club, written a 
monthly newspaper, and implemented many other student driven projects.
 
 
Our Las Positas PTA  assists our students and staff with funding for field t
rips, classroom expenditures, 
running our annual Scholastic Book Fair, Red Ribbon Week, Color Run, Trunks and Treats, just to name 
a few. We have a great team and community supporting our students in their learning and for their 
future.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Types of Services Funded
 
Las Positas is a Title I school and receives money from the federal 
government to help us improve our low
-

funds pay for three classroom aides who support students in our Wonders 
reading program, pur
chases books and materials needed to make our 
various programs effective, and translations for school to home 
communication. Las Positas also receives Local Control Supplemental and 
Concentration funds which support our after school Las Positas Academy 
pro
gram and summer academy for students who are not meeting grade 
level standards.
 
 
The PTA works very hard on our behalf to provide funds to offset the cost 
of field trips, field trip transportation, and school assemblies through their 
annual sales fundraise
r(s). Our Student Ambassadors also raise funds 
through Student Store sales, Box Tops for Education collection, and other 
student
-
led activities.
 
 
We also receive funds from numerous grants; The Nutrition Network and 
CEEP. These grants provide Las Positas
 
students with enrichment activities, 
such as field trips, assemblies as a supplement to their educational 
requirements.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enr
ollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Lib
rary). Access to the Internet 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on 
availabili
ty), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

School Safety
 
Plan
 
One of our most important goals at Las Positas is to establish and maintain a safe, healthy, and positive school environment.
 
To ensure student safety, 
our staff constantly monitors the school grounds 20 minutes before and 20 minutes after school, as
 
well as at all recesses and lunch time. Students and 
staff regularly review good safety practices and rules for responsible behavior in classes and on the playground. Our campus 
is closed and we require all 
visitors to report to the school office to obtai

 
 
Our School Safety Plan is revised and shared with staff annually. This plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes,
 
parent pick
-
up during 
emergencies, and location of emergency supplies. A copy of this plan is kept in the off
ice for parent review. The 2019
-
2020 School Safety Plan was 
approved by our School Site Council on October 23, 2019.
 
 
Fire, earthquake, and/or intruder
-
on
-
campus drills are practiced monthly. We pride ourselves on the fact that on our yearly parent questio
nnaire, 
students and parents overwhelmingly respond that they feel Las Positas is a safe place for children.

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received scores.

Las Positas
 
teachers attend staff development throughout the year to review student data, test results and to explore new ideas for impro
ving classroom 
instruction. Students are released one hour early each Wednesday to provide teachers time to meet in Professional L
earning Communities (PLC) to 
collaborate on student achievement data, review student work, and discuss and share instructional strategies. Our designated 
full time MTSS (Multi
-
Tiered System of Support) TOSA (Teacher on Special Assignment) and our IB PYP (I
nternational Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme) Coordinator 
support teachers throughout the year as they implement new instructional strategies, review data, create/refine/reflect on IB
 
units of study, and program 
of inquiry. Most teachers have attende
d an IB PYP training and all certificated staff will attend training by January 2020. Our district technology coach 
supports teachers implementing technology as an instructional tool, educational tool and communication tool.
 
 
Due to our district PE teacher
s, our classroom teachers have an additional 40
-
60 minutes per week to collaborate with each other and discuss lesson 
design, student work and/or student needs.
 
 
Staff development is devoted to aligning our curriculum to the Common Core Standards, IB Stand
ards and Practices, analysis of assessment results, and 
training in improved instructional strategies. Through our partnership with InnovateEd, our Site Leadership Team has embraced
 
developing a schoolwide 
instructional focus and has modeled strategies for
 
staff during professional development and utilized the coplan/coteach method. During our Leadership 
Institutes, teachers and the principal look at data and review the most pressing issues of the previous year to choose specif
ic topics for staff developmen
t 
during the upcoming year. We then develop a professional development cycle in which teachers learn, research, practice, and r
eflect on the specific 
strategies that they have found to be most effective. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, professional devel
opment is focused on the implementation and 
success of i
-
Ready and on MTSS protocols/strategies, developing our MTSS plan, writing across the curriculum and our IB PYP framework.
 
 
Teachers use specific ELD (English Language Development) strategies to help 
bridge the gap between native English speakers and English learners. The 
efficacy of this teaching is tested on the yearly ELPAC exam. The ELD standards, test data analysis, differentiated instructi
on, Wonders EL curriculum, 
Step Up to Writing, Thinking Ma
ps, and GLAD strategies, as well as scaffold instruction for all students are implemented to support learning. Teachers 
participate in Targeted Leadership Institutes to review research
-
based practices, and we hold classroom walkthroughs to observe practice
s in action.
