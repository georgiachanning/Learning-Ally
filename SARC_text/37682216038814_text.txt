School Description
 
Welcome to another fantastic school year! We have so much to celebrate at Palmer Way School, 
and it is because of the support from 
our families, our highly qualified teachers, and the committed 
and engaged students that we are so successful. We are all partners in the educational journey of 
children. As a team, we strive for excellence in academics and in the social 

 
emotional 
develo
pment of children.  We have all known what a great school we have in our community and 
it is even better to know that the Educational Results Partnership (ERP) and the Campaign for 
Business and Education Excellence (CBEE), has recognized Palmer Way School 
as an Honor Roll 
school for the 2018 
-
 
2019 California Honor Roll.
 
 

school maintains high academic standards by providing a rigorous academic program that 
add

success of our students and works collaboratively to provide the most effective instructional 
learning experiences.  Palmer Way is a great place to learn and gro
w, offering a relevant and 
rigorous curriculum based on the Common Core Standards and project
-
based learning. Technology 
is also used extensively by staff and students. The skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, 
and critical thinking are a foc
us in each classroom preparing the students for the challenges of the 
21st century.
 
 
I firmly believe that parent and community involvement, as well as communication and 
collaboration, are essential to the overall success of our school.  Palmer Way has a n
ew and growing 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA). The PTA is the heart of the school and a vital link between 
parents, teachers and community members. Through our programs and activities, the Palmer Way 
Elementary PTA helps to meet the needs of children in 
our school.  Volunteers are greatly 
appreciated and we would love for you to join our efforts. Please visit the school and inquire how 
you can GET INVOLVED.
 
 
Palmer Way is in our third year of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) 
implementation. PBIS is a framework or approach for assisting school personnel in adopting and 
organizing evidence
-
based behavioral interventions into an integrated continuum that enhances 
academic and social behavior outcomes for all students.  Our PBIS t
eam meets monthly to identify 
challenge areas and come up with strategies to improve student behavior.  We are very excited to 
continue enhancing this approach at Palmer Way School.  In addition Palmer Way has been 
investing many hours of professional deve
lopment on writing.   At Palmer Way we believe that 
focusing on writing, with writing skills in such high demand, increased writing instruction and 
student feedback can benefit students for the rest of their lives. Heightened focus on these skills at 
the e
lementary level is essential in ensuring the future success of America's future leaders.  
Teachers are encouraged to exchange ideas with other teachers while also communicating with 
parents, in order to bring real
-
life context and innovation and technology
 
to the curriculum.  Writing 
is not just a way of learning; it's a way of working together. If students learn to take responsibility 
for their own learning, they will form the basis for the way they will work with others in their adult 
lives.
 
 
I feel so fo
rtunate to be a part of the Palmer Way Family! Working together as a team, Palmer Way 
teachers, staff, and parents do whatever it takes to ensure the academic and personal success of 
all our students. High student achievement, outstanding character, along 
with school 
connectedness and safety continue to be our top priorities.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Maintenance and Repair
 
 
Distri
ct maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in 
a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority
.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
 
We have made a conscientious effort to provide a clean and attractive campus. Students are encouraged to have pride in their 
school and keep the 
campus clean. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for
 
all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office or at the district maintenance office. The principal works daily with the custodial staff and the custodial
 
supervisor to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a cl
ean and safe school.
 
 
The Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT)
 
 
The FIT is used on a yearly basis to identify facility needs and repairs. All items found in need of repair on the FIT are ad
dressed. Items that involve asphalt, 
roofing, flooring or painting are 
addressed through the District's deferred maintenance program. All other items are expedited into the National School 
District work order system and repaired by our maintenance department.

The selection of 
focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful analysis of achievement data. The district calendar earmarks 
full days and early release time for providing site
-
based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opp
ortunities to attend conferences 
and district
-
wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2019
-
20 school year all teachers at Palmer Way will receive approximately 
30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University
 
of California Irvine subject matter project. This professional development 
will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands
-
on, research
-
based professional 
development, standards
-
based c
urriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath 
adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education rese
archers. A fo
cus on 
professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAAS
PP data. In the area of 
language arts, all of our teachers will receive in
-
depth professional development in the California 
ELA/ELD framework. The ELA/ELD framework 
professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the n
eed for teachers to be 
excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver 
robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have been delivered through 
teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and during individual teache
r 
planning days. We hav
e four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and English Language 
Development. We also have credentialed teachers that provide Engineering is Elementary lessons for students. This provides op
portunity for
 
the 
Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all teachers will receive staff development in 
the implementation of 
our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous reading, our district offic
e has adopted the American Reading Company 
100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff development on the implementation and best practices used for these readi
ng baskets for students. Our 
counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony so
cial
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver 
this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers ha
ve received professional 
development o
n how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports 
to all students. 
of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for implementation of Common Core Standar
ds, best practices for Data Teams 
collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific t
raining to support the needs 
of English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs and tea
chers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting 
the unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group
, grade
-
level teams, and 
through individual 
mentoring by the school administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one a
nd two 
teachers. Teachers who are experiencing difficulty or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Progr
am.
 
 
In addition to district level professional development focused around English language arts and math, Palmer Way also has a s
trong focus on Writing.  
Many hours of professional development are spent on identifying, studying and implementing Writing St
rategies  At Palmer Way we believe that the 
skills most important to develop in young children, is a love of reading and writing. A child with a book or pencil in her ha
nds is a child with a bright future 
in front of her.  Reading and writing may be looked
 

education comes to an end. Living in the digital age has made literacy even more important, as communicating professionally v
ia writing is an important 
skill in most workplaces.  At a time when professionals spend one third of their time reading and writing emails, written com
munication is more important 
than ever before for success in academics and beyond. The earlier in life writing skills are developed
, the stronger these skills will be in the long run, 
highlighting the importance of writing in elementary school.
