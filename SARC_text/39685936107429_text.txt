By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Dis
trict 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.
 
The results of this survey are available at the District Office. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of S
chool Buildings
 
George McParland School was completed in 1989 including the administration building, a multi
-
purpose room, library, 
and several classrooms. A few portable classrooms have been added for a total of 42. In 2002, the annex was completed 
adding
 
20 classrooms, a multi
-
purpose room, library, and administration building.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order process is us
ed to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

is available at
 
the school office and at the District Office. Staff works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The District allocates funding for deferred maintenance. The Deferred M
aintenance Program includes funding for 
replacement of existing school building components so that the educational process may safely continue. Typically, this 
includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, wall systems, floor s

2019

2020 budget allocated $640,000 to address deferred maintenance needs throughout the district.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 

Facility Master 
plan. As part of that activity there are projects planned at the campus which will be completed through the use of local 
funds. State funding will also be sought for those projects which may be eligible for modernization. The modernization 
project at George McParland is scheduled to start construction in the spring of 2020. This project includes a new 
multipurpose room, modernization of the existing campus including fire alarm, paging, accessibility and asphalt 
replacement.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

All school sites in the Manteca Unified School District annually update the Disaster Plan and School Safety Plan. The plan 
was revised by Safe Schools Consultants and Site Administration according to the required adoption process with 
appropriate School Si
te Council public hearings and School Safety Planning Committee input. Teachers and staff annually 
receive training on disaster procedures. Teachers and staff received ongoing training throughout the 2019

uidelines established by the state. The safety plans are confirmed and approved 
by March 1, 2020.
