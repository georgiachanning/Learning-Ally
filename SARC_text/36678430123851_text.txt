By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Mission Statement
 
The total Mission Elementary Community will provide a curriculum aligned to Common Core State Standards through 
challenging and meaningful learning opportunities to our di
verse student population so they achieve grade level academic 
standards, are college and career ready, and become lifelong learners.
 
 
Mission is one of 16 elementary schools in the Redlands Unified School District and serves just under 600 students on a 
tr
aditional school schedule and went school
-
wide Title 1 in the 2016
-
2017 school year. A description of this process may 
be referenced in the 2016
-
2017 SPSA.
 
 
Mission Elementary School was "revitalized" in 2011 after nearly two decades of being closed as an 
elementary school.  
The school initially opened around 1851 as a one
-
room schoolhouse to serve the local students whose parents provided 
the labor force for constructing the Zanja, or watering canal, that irrigated the local orange groves.  A second school
 
was 
built in 1881, with a third being constructed in 1904.  The current campus has three buildings containing 20 classrooms, a 
library, and large multipurpose room.  The larger of the two structures was built in the 1937 as a "WPA" project and was 
the Mis
sion School to replace the 1904 facility.  Our current second building was constructed in the early 1970s as an 
orthopedically handicapped facility, known as the Heisner Center. A third building contains two classrooms and sit parallel 
to the outdoor joggi
ng track.  Eventually the two facilities were merged to become Mission Elementary School. More 
recently, two  modular classrooms have been added.
 
 
Mission elementary has recently been awarded California Distinguished School with the belief that all 
students deserve 
the opportunity to be educated in a way that prepares them for college and we believe this preparation begins in 
kindergarten. It is this belief that has fueled our college preparation focus here on campus where we are committed to 
creatin
g a school that knows no limits to the academic success and future readiness of each student. We teach every child 
with equitable practices to ensure they all have a chance to reach higher education if they select to do so. We recognize 
the challenges our 
students may have, however, we never make excuses for their success.

Building Better Futures...No Excuses is not only our motto, but how we live each day at Mission. You will find that this is a
 
vibrant, engaging community of teachers and learners, a plac
e high expectations are set for all students where every 
student without exception and without excuse will be proficient in reading, language arts and math. Our energies have 
been spent on building this belief by nurturing a culture of universal achievemen
t of students by collaborating regularly 
as a school community to strengthen our alignment of standards, assessment of the standards being taught, and managing 
the data from the assessments. This systematic approach allows us the necessary information need
ed to offer meaningful 
interventions to our students, both remediation and acceleration interventions.
 
 
Approximately  84% of the students qualify for and are receiving  Free and Reduced Lunch.
 
 
Instruction is provided by highly qualified teachers.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mission Elementary School underwent a total revitalization, which was completed in Au
gust, 2012.  This includes a facility 
with 20 classrooms, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a library, and complete athletic field and playground structure.  Being 
that the building is virtually "new", there are no needed major maintenance to ensure good repa
ir.  The buildings remain 
in good condition although interior/exterior paint will need some refreshing in the future. Summer, 2018 two new modular 
classrooms were added due to our increased student enrollment. Play structures are starting to experience wea
r and tear 
and are beginning to require repairs/replacements. This includes the rubber mat. Paint on outer buildings, curbs, and 
ground is wearing and needs freshened. Asphalt in parking lot and on basketball courts needs re
-
surfacing due to large 
cracks a
nd pot holes.The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these 
standards is available at the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily 
with the custodial staf
f to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant 
to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education 
population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a
re aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

The Mission Elementary School Safety Plan is currently being reviewed and amended by our School Safety Committee and 
the staff.  Mission Elementary School utilizes data from its California Safe Schoo
l Assessment and suspension/expulsion 
reports to evaluate the current status of school crime. A Safe School Plan is adopted each school year and is
 
reflective of the school's safety needs.Some of the key components of Mission's Safe School Plan which are b
eing 
evaluated and amended currently include a description of school discipline policies and procedures, dress code guidelines, 
suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, dangerous pupil 
notification, a
nd
 
disaster response procedures.

School Safety 
-
 
To ensure student safety before school, teachers, campus monitors and administrators supervise the 
school grounds including the bus drop
-
off area, Parent drop off area, cafeteria, and playground. During the
 
school day all 
entrance areas to the school are locked with the exception of the front entrance, which is near the administration office 
and multipurpose room. Signs are posted to indicate all visitors must report to the administration office and may not 
be 
on school grounds unless they have a visitor's pass. After school, staff is present at the main parking pick
-
up area and bus 
leading zone. Staff and administration supervise the areas until all students have left the campus for home. New this year 
is th
e Raptor system where visitors must always scan their ID before being given permission to remain on campus. Our 
campus is a secured campus where only one gate is open for students to enter and exit before and after school. This gate 
is supervised by an adu
lt to ensure that non
-
students and non
-
school employees  are not able to penetrate the entrance. 
In addition to the monthly fire drills, Mission is now holding monthly Lock Down Drills to include Safe and Secure, Lock 
Down, and High Alert Lock Downs. Safet
y and disaster supplies have been purchased and updated with the help of our 
PTA and community donations.

Mission teachers regularly engage in professional development sessions at the school 
site and district level. These include 
English Language, Writing Academies, Google Workshops, Classroom Management Workshops, co
-
planning and lesson 
study sessions, and more. Occasionally, teachers will attend other professional development workshops provi
ded by 
outside entities. For example, staff members continue to participate in the No Excuses University, PBIS and Daily 5 
conferences. Additional in

-
wide "Benchmarks" and 
grade

student writing samples and provide instruction in using the Internet and implement technology into curricular areas. Our 
calendar includes monthly 1

hour monthly staff collaboration days where teachers 
participate in professional development, and eight minimum days through out the school that are dedicated to 
professional development. In addition, one full day a year i
s a non
-
student day where teachers participate in professional 
development. Newly hired teachers also participate in a week long teacher orientation at the district and receive support 
through the District Induction program.
 
 
The Redlands Unified School Di
strict administration evaluates permanent teachers every other year or every 5 years, 
depending on the evaluation process administered. Probationary teachers are evaluated two consecutive years and, if 
made permanent, every other year subsequent to their p
robationary period. The evaluation process provides the 
opportunity for administrators to assist teachers to improve or enhance their instructional skills and methods. During the 
evaluation process, teachers are formally observed twice, informally observed
 
as needed, and receive a summary 
evaluation report every year they are evaluated. Orientation to the evaluation process is covered in meetings with each 
teacher to be evaluated prior to November 1 of each school year. The formal observations follow and a 
written summary 
is presented to and reviewed with the teacher after each formal observation during the specified time period between 
September and March. In the formal observation summary meetings, the principal offers suggestions for improvement or 
recogn
izes appropriate teaching strategies being utilized. Following both observations, a formal meeting to discuss the 
final evaluation document is held prior to the March 1 deadline for probationary teachers and the May 15 deadline for 
permanent teachers. The 
teachers have the option of an Alternative Evaluation which begins with an orientation, goal 
setting and meeting to discuss the plan for the alternative evaluation. A minimum of two meetings are held with 
administration to review the progress toward goals 
and to address needs the teachers may have. Informal observations 
occur throughout the year and the teacher(s) submit a written report/student work to show the results and learning of 
their alternative evaluation. The system of certificated evaluation comp
lies with the requirements of the Education Code. 
Areas required to be addressed by the evaluation system include, but are not limited to the following: suitable learning
 
environment; instructional techniques and strategies, achievement of curricular objec
tives; and pupil progress 
-
 
CSTPs.
 
 
Recently added was the Progress Adviser tool where administrators can log observations in order to better support 
student and teacher needs in the classroom.
