School Description
 
 
Sheridan Elementary School serves  
kindergarten through fifth
-
grade students and is located in the 
Western Placer Unified School District (WPUSD) between Lincoln and Wheatland in the western 
region of Placer County. The students are housed on the campus in multi
-
grade classrooms with a 
popu
lation of 66 students.  The ethnic makeup is as follows: Caucasian 57%, Hispanic/Latino 36%, 
American Indian or Alaska Native 3%, Black or African American 2% and two or more races 2%.  
Efforts are made to ensure that the transition from preschool to kinde
rgarten is a smooth and 
enjoyable experience.  The principal is Emily Ortiz. Scott Leaman is the Western Placer Unified 
School District Superintendent.
 
 
Sheridan Elementary School is committed to providing a safe, healthy learning environment.  
Specific pr
ograms which emphasize this include: healthy lifestyles education, evacuation drills; 
monthly fire drills and emergency lock
-
down drills. All non
-
students coming on to campus must 
check in through the office to sign
-
in and obtain a badge.  Students are sup
ervised before and after 
school by district staff.  There are 44 students who attend the after
-
school program.  This program 
provides students with enrichment opportunities in the area of homework, art, crafts, gardening 
and physical education.  Our school
 
safety plan is in place as well as our district crisis plan.  Both 
plans are updated annually and work together to encompass the safety of all of our students, staff, 
parents, and community.
 
 
Combination classes are in place.  We have a transitional kinde
rgarten/kindergarten/first; 
second/third; and a fourth/fifth configuration. As per the California Education Code, there are a 
required number of minutes per year for each grade level. The number of instructional minutes at 
Sheridan School is over 56,000, w
ell over the required EdCode minutes. The percentage of students 
in the free and reduced lunch program is 68%.
 
 
Incorporated into the regular program are: peer tutoring, cross
-
age buddies, math and reading 
interventions (first within the classroom using En
Vision Math, Ready Mathematics, Benchmark 
Advance, Ready Common Core, iReady, Sonday System, SIPPS and Read Naturally) parent 
volunteers, an emphasis on building good peer relationships and transitioning to middle school, 
hands
-
on science classes, AVID Ele
mentary, music and visual and performing arts which include 
performances for the school community.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information
 
about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they int
end to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requiremen
ts, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smar
ter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

statistical accuracy or to protect student 
privacy.
 
 
Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3
