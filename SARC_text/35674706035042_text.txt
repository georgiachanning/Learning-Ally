School Description
 
Sunnyslope School is a family oriented
 
community in which students, families, staff and community 
members work together to provide the best education possible for all students.  Sunnyslope's 
commitment to students succeeding is strongly aligned with the school district's expectations and 
visio
n of an extraordinary learning community where each of our students are prepared for future 
success.  This is evidenced in the alignment of planning, use of time, designation of human and 
fiscal resources, and on
-
going monitoring of student progress.
 
 
Ever
yone within the Sunnyslope community shares the vision of academic success for all students.  
Response to Intervention strategies and ongoing assessment data are used by all staff to continually 
adjust their instruction and to help all students meet and ex
ceed grade level standards.  Teachers 
meet regularly in grade level teams at he school site as well as the district level to review standards 
and data, and align instructional lessons with the Common Core Standards.  Parents are kept up to 
date of school e
vents via monthly newsletters, messages on school messenger, and the marquee 
at the front of the school site.  Many parents monitor their student's progress online by accessing 
the electronic gradebook.  State, district, and school assessment results are p
rovided to parents to 
assist them in understanding their child's progress, areas of strength, and areas for growth.  The 
Sunnyslope webpage includes students links to electronic learning games and activities that 
students can use at school or at home.
 
 
At 
the core of Sunnyslope's success is a caring and dedicated professional staff.  Teachers across 
grade levels support each other professionally and personally.  Teachers continue to build 
relationships with their students, parents, and staff with the Captur
ing Kids Hearts Program.  
Parents are a very important and involved pert of each classroom and an integral part of our school 
community.  Education is highly valued by our families and there is a high degree of parent 
satisfaction, involvement, and pride i
n our school.  The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) is 
invaluable to our school success.  Their monetary contributions provide a wide range of extra 
curricular activities and classroom materials.  This along with many volunteer hours are major 
contributor
's to Sunnyslope's success.
 
 
There is a strong commitment to excellence on the part of the Sunnyslope Staff.  Sunnyslope boasts 
an outstanding teaching staff with many teacher leaders that continually make adjustments in their 
instruction and their desire 
to help all students succeed.  Improvement in student schievement is 
directly related to all teachers working in Professional Learning Communities, focusing on the use 
of assessment data, Common Core Standards, standards
-
based materials, and research based
 
strategies.
 
 
Sunnyslope's Mission and Vision  is to be a learning environment: Where every student is achieving 
at his or her maximum potential in an engaging, inspiring, and challenging learning environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Sunnyslope School, constructed in 1961, provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, visitors, and volunteers. The
 
site has 45 classrooms (not 
all currently in use), multiple
 
sets of bathrooms (some are gender specific while others are all gender), a library, a multipurpose room, a staff room, 3 
playgrounds and a large playing field.
 
 
Safety: Students are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. Supervision is 
provided for students throughout the school day; the 
responsibility is shared between teachers, administration, classified staff, and yard supervisors. Gates at the perimeter of 
the school are locked during 
the student day. All visitors must go through the
 
school office, sign in and out, and wear an identification badge while on campus. The school is in 
compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.
 
 
Cleaning: A team of three custodians ens
ures classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe daily.
 
 
Maintenance and repair: A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the Hollister School District. A work order proces
s is utilized to ensure 
efficient service and comple
tion of tasks in a timely manner.
 
 
Modernization:  On November 4, 2014, the voters of the Hollister School District passed Measure M, a $28.5 million Facilities
 
Bond that will address the 
most critical renovation and modernization needs at the District's e
lementary and middle schools. In the Summer/Fall of 2017, Sunnyslope was 
modernized under Measure M. For a complete list of projects go to http://hesd.org/departments/facilities/measure_m_progress.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Fire drills are conducted every month. Earthquake drills are conducted every trim
ester. Code Blue drills are conducted twice a year, once in the fall and 
again in the spring. All visitors to the campus are required to sign in at the office and display a visitors badge at all tim
es. Gates at the perimeter of the 
school are locked during
 
the student day. Supervision is provided for students throughout the school day; the responsibility is shared between teacher
s, 
administration, classified staff, and yard supervisors.
 
 
Our school wide discipline policy focuses on encouraging students to b
e respectful and make positive choices.  Students are held accountable for their 
actions.  Teachers communicate with parents as issues may arise in the classroom.  This is often done before a student is sen
t to the office with a discipline 
referral.

Types of Services Funded
 
In addition to state funding, Hollister School District receives federal categorical funding. In 2018
-
2019 the district received funding from the following 
programs: Title I 
-
 
Education for the Disadvantaged, Title II 

 
Teacher and Principal Training and R
ecruiting, and Title III 
-
 
English Language Acquisition and 
Academic Achievement. Using general fund money in combination with categorical funding, the district provided every K 

 
5 elementary site (also the K 
-
 
6 and K 
-
 
8 sites) with an Intervention Teac
her and a Physical Education Teacher.  The Intervention Teacher plans with teachers and provides small group 
intervention instruction. The P.E. Teacher provides the required minutes of instruction to grade level groups of students, al
lowing the teachers mo
re 
time to collaborate about instruction and/or provide intervention instruction. Students who qualify also participate in befor
e or after school intervention 
classes, provided through the Supplemental Education Services, Title I. Students who qualify thro
ugh Migrant Education receive additional intervention 
services. Site
-
based Title I funds are used to support the Accelerated Reader program, field trips, and assemblies. Decisions about the expe
nditure of 
these funds are made with the School Site Council, 
based on achievement data for the school.

of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print
