About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents and community members are highly encouraged to get involved and play an active role in the development and betterment
 
of the school by 
being active participants and advocates for
 

curriculum development can assist both school and community in on
-
going program improvement. We have made a commitment to provide the best 
educational progr
am possible for students. The quality of our program is a reflection of our highly committed and dedicated staff. We are comm
itted to 
ensuring that Elm Street School is a welcoming, stimulating and safe environment where students are actively involved in l
earning academics as well as 
positive values. Through our arduous work, our students will be challenged to reach their maximum potential.
 
Parent involvement and engagement is a crucial component to the academic and social emotional success of students at E
lm St. Elementary School. 
Regular communication in the form of written notes, phone calls, parent meetings, Blackboard calling system messages, school 
website, social media, 
school marquee, and daily face to face contact and interactions, are methods used 
to keep a constant and consistent line of two
-
way open 
communication. Elm Street School benefits from an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA), which consists of every PTA Board 
member being a parent. 
The PTA works with the school community throughout va
rious school fundraisers, school activities, school events, and educational excursions. School 
Site Council (SSC), the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and monthly Coffee with the Principal meetings are three 
additional stakeholder 
site
-
based pl
atforms through which parents are involved in the input and decision
-
making of school programs and resources allocation. Parents and 
guardians play an active role in parent engagement opportunities provided by the school of which include parent education w
orkshops, parent classes 
on a variety of topics, family reading nights, and volunteering in their children's classrooms. Teachers use common core stan
dards based progress reports 
and assessment data to communicate student progress to parents in a language 
they can understand. In order to serve our parents and the community, 
Elm Street School has an established a relationship with Ventura County Behavioral Health which provides a cost free series o
f workshops and classes on 
nutrition, health and exercise, me
ntal health services, positive parenting, dental hygiene, human growth and development, managing difficult behaviors, 
and mother
-
daughter relationships. We realize that the school belongs to the community, and our charge is to educate and serve the schoo
l 
community 
at large to the best of our ability in meeting and supporting their needs.
 
Elm is steadfast in creating a school that knows no limits to the academic and social emotional successes of each student thr
ough constant reevaluation 
of the mission, vis
ion, and critical analysis of our best practices and changing needs. At Elm Street School, we dedicate ourselves to providing
 
the best 
start in a journey of lifelong learning for all of our students, families, and community which includes college, career, 
and civic life for 21st century 
readiness.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Elm Street Elementary School. Elm is a closed campus, thus all visit
ors to the school must sign in 

 
Supervision is a responsibility shared among campus supervisors, teachers, custodial staff, office staff, 
and the Principal. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during recesses, at lunch, and
 
after school. To mainta
in 
constant communication, campus supervisors, custodial staff, office staff, and the Principal carry two
-
way radios while on duty.
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) has been developed by the Safe
ty Committee, comprised 
of classified staff, teachers, and the Principal. The Safety Plan is updated annually by the Safety Team.  All revisions and 
updates are reviewed immediately 
with the staff as well as key groups on campus.   The plan has been review
ed by ELAC and SSC.  Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on visitor policy, 
volunteer policy, student and staff safety and wellness, dress code, discipline, playground supervision, emergency disaster k
its, and emergency 
procedures.
 
 
The school is always 
in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Safety 
drills 
are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held monthly, and earthquake and lockdown drills are held twice a year with sup
port from our school resource 
officer and the Oxnard Police Department.
