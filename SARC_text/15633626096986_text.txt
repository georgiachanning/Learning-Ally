School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Stockdale Elementary is located at 7801 Kroll Way, south of Stockdale Highway and just east of Gosford Road.  Stockdale 
Elementary opened in the fall of 1977 and is name
d after the area originally known as the Tevis
-
Stockdale Estate.  
Recognized as A NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL OF EXCELLENCE, four times as a CALIFORNIA DISTINGUISHED SCHOOL, 
and recognized as AN INTERNATIONAL READING ASSOCIATION EXEMPLARY READING PROGRAM S
CHOOL, the mission of 
Stockdale Elementary is to efficiently and equitably prepare all students for productive and successful citizenship in our 
society by creating a positive learning environment where all students are valued and encouraged to realize the
ir optimum 
potential. Stockdale Elementary's purpose statement is, "Inspiring hope while ensuring high levels of learning for all 
students." The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California 
voters 
in November 1988.  The Report Card, to be issued annually by local school boards for each elementary and 
secondary school in the state, provides for parents and other interested people a variety of information about the school, 
its resources, its successes
, and the areas in which improvements are needed.
 
 
Stockdale Elementary received School Improvement Program (SIP) and Economic Impact Aid
-
Limited English Proficient 
(EIA
-
LEP) funds from the state. Our EIA
-
LEP funds were used to assist identified English La
nguage Learners.  SIP monies 
fund all students with core instruction and extra curricular activities.  A standards
-
based curriculum and sound assessment 
strategies provide the foundation for continuous improvement of student performance and school programs
.  Students 
will leave Stockdale Elementary with a positive attitude toward learning, a strong foundation in basic skills, and the abilit
y 
to meet future academic challenges.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Stockdale Elementary School provides a safe and clean
 
environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that 
provides for good learning. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physica
l plant exceed California Building and Safety 

exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for studen
t protection and safety. A team of 
custodians ensures classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and 
secured at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our 
Safe Schools Plan, 
the safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our students. Staff receive inservice in 
emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to substitute teachers, volunteers, and other visitors as they 
register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground are locked during school hours and staff 
members are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local 
law enforcement is e
vident in their quick response time when concerns arise. Designated staff members carefully 
supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly 
for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire 
and/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and 
available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervisi
on of students begins officially at 7:20 a.m. when the school 
opens and supervision ends at 2:45 p.m.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

students with opportunities to learn self
-
discipline through a system of consistent rewards and consequences for their 
behavior.  Stockdale 
Elementary believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature both 
academically and emotionally.  We expect students to be respectful, rsponsible and safe. Parents and students are 
informed of discipline policies at the beginning 
of each school year through classroom orientation as well as individual 
parent
-
student handbooks.
 
 
Stockdale Elementary discussed, updated and reviewed its comprehensive safety plan on October 3rd during a committee 
meeting comprised of school stakeholders
 
and again during a school site council meeting on October 10th. Following are 
a few of the key elements of our plan: ensuring consistency with safety practices, PBIS implementation, quick response to 
crisis situations, promotion of incentives for exemplar
y academic performance, success of student valet program and the 
importance of visibility of staff.
 
 
Students with excessive tardies, truancies or unexcused absences are subject to corrective actions including loss of 
privileges and mandatory parent confer
ences. We truly believe that missing school is missing out. The District has 
established an Independent Study Program for students who must be absent from school due to illness for an extended 
period of time.

Stockdale establishes guidelines to provide st
udents with a meaningful, productive, and enjoyable school experience.  
Appropriate behavior is encouraged through praise and motivational incentives as well as assertive discipline and conflict 
resolution tools to further develop personal growth.  Expulsi
ons occur only when required by law or when all other 
alternatives are exhausted.
