Description
 
Sowers Middle School 
-
 
Setting the Course for 21st Century Leaders
 
 
Isaac L. Sowers students will experience an academically challenging and supportive learning 

potential.
 
 
Beliefs
 

 
Developmental Awareness: Our dedicated and knowledgeable staff recognizes the 
developmental uniqueness of the middle school child and demonstrates a commitment 
to foster the conditions necessary for student achievement. School personnel
 
models 
the qualities and characteristics they expect to instill in students.
 

 
Nurturing Learning Environment: We offer an inviting, safe, and purposeful 
environment which is conducive to learning. Parents and staff will work together to 
provide students wi
th the time, support, and encouragement they need to achieve.
 

 
Supportive Structure and Schedule: We are organized to promote meaningful 
professional collaboration with a focus on learning and providing access for all 
students. Teams are viewed as the build
ing blocks for a strong Professional Learning 
Community. We place a high priority on protecting instructional and collaborative 
planning time, maintaining a reasonable class size, and providing supportive student 
services during the regular school day.
 

 
Sta
ndards
-
based Curriculum: We will provide a core curriculum that can be enriched, 
extended, or differentiated to meet the individual learning needs of students. 
Education in the fine and practical arts, physical education, and language are valued as 
integra
l parts of the instructional program. We will provide a standards
-
based learning 
environment which clearly establishes criterion for subject mastery and identifies what 
students will know and be able to accomplish as a result of completing the instructiona
l 
program. The scope and sequence of the curriculum will reflect a continuum of 
offerings that challenge all students.
 

 
Focus on Best Practices of Instruction: We will develop and implement a wide array of 
strategies to optimize student learning. Technology
 
will be integrated into the 
instructional process as a means to achieve specific curricular outcomes. We value an 
on
-
going process of vertical articulation with elementary and high school colleagues to 
ensure a continuum of instruction.
 

 
Clarity of Assessm
ent Goals and Practices (Progress Indicators): We will employ a 
variety of methods to measure the learning progress of every student. Teachers, in 
collaboration with their departments, will develop consistent grading practices in 
support of the instruction
al program. Assessment information will be used to guide the 

progress.
 

 
Emphasis on Active Participation: We will promote active student participation in co
-
curricula
r programs. The middle school years offer students their first real opportunity 
to enjoy a range of extracurricular activities, engage in exploratory study, and 
participate in the performing arts. We recognize the potential of these programs to 
enhance the
 
health and fitness of young adolescents, improve academic performance, 
and build positive links between school, families, and the local community.

Sowers Middle School opened in 1971, as a 6th through 8th grade middle school. Sowers is located in a city c
haracterized by miles of 
beautiful Pacific shoreline, bicycle paths, parks, and an ecological preserve. The school is one of two middle schools and se
ven elementary 
schools serving approximately 6,800 students in Huntington Beach. The school facility is at
tractive, well
-
maintained, and situated in a 
residential area adjacent to a park. There are 43 classrooms which are allocated for general, elective, and special education
 
classes and 
support services. The school also offers a Multipurpose Room (room 402), 
and separate boys and girls Physical Education locker rooms. 
Assemblies, student programs, and large activities are conducted in a spacious interior school mall complete with stage and s
ound system. 
Technologically, Sowers is fully networked in all classro
oms with both hardwired and wireless networking capabilities. 
 
 
Sowers Middle School faces many of the same challenges and opportunities confronting schools throughout Southern California. 
Sowers 
offers a rich elective program along with school clubs, comm
ittees, and activity groups for students to join. In addition, pyramids of 
intervention classes have been designed to help students experiencing difficulty achieving school success. Sowers Middle Scho
ol also 
offers CORE areas of English Language Arts and S
ocial Studies in block periods with GATE/Honors classes at all grade levels. Along with 
our regular math curriculum, an accelerated math program is offered in grades 7th and 8th for eligible students to participat
e based on 
district criteria. Services are 
provided in designated special education programs with a continuum of support which includes co
-
teaching 
with one special education and one general education teacher in CORE classes, two special day classes, and guided support in 
math. We 
also provide soci
al thinking classes for students with needs in socialization. A school
-
wide positive behavior system is in place in which all 
students, staff, and community follow the ISMS Way demonstrating Integrity 
-
 
Safety 
-
 
Making Responsible Choices 
-
 
Showing Respect
. 
 
 
A talented and enthusiastic staff makes Sowers a school where students take pride in learning and growing socially. Parents f
eel supported 
and teachers have the tools to help students learn. Our instructional team, work collaboratively under the constr
uct of Professional 
Learning Communities(PLC) developing and implementing programs that motivate and engage all students. Our teachers care deepl
y 
about all aspects of the school programs, participate in shared decision
-
making, and engage in professional d
evelopment activities to 
build skills to meet students' needs, understand the uniqueness of the middle school child, and perform with distinction. Our
 
support staff 
works together to nurture the intellectual, physical, and emotional capacities of each chil
d. Sowers staff members are well trained, 
experienced, and are enthusiastic about meeting student needs. Our Student Body of approximately 1,056 regular and special ed
ucation 
students represent a cross section of cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds, a
s well as an array of ability levels from the learning 
handicapped to the intellectually gifted. The virtues of mutual respect and recognition of personal dignity are fostered and 
nurtured by 
students and staff. The contributions, achievements, and progres
s of ALL students are valued and respected. The parents and community 
are an integral part of the Sowers School community and are welcomed to participate as volunteers in school, speakers, commit
tee 
members, PTSA, and School Site Council. The local communi
ty and family involvement is vital to the success of our educational program 
at Sowers.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School categorical funding, which  includes Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and Special Education, are resources which a
re allocated to support 
under
-
performing students. Our Parent
 
Teacher Student Association (PTSA) provides monetary support of individual classroom and school
-
wide 
instructional materials and programs. For example, PTSA has generously supported the purchase of Chromebook carts and laptops
 
for all teachers 
(technology
), funding for entire grade level field trips (programs), and support of school climate building.  Teachers, as well as stude
nts from the local 
high school and universities, are available to provide additional support to at
-
risk students. Community organiz
ations and resources provide additional 
support to our school and families. These resources include: the Regional Center of Orange County, parent education offerings
, and the Huntington Beach 
Libraries, Phoenix House/Behavioral Health Intervention Systems,
 
as well as the Outreach Counseling program.
 
 
All opportunities are offered to parents in PTSA, School Site Council, District Advisory Committee (DAC), School Committees, 
Community Forums, and 
Coffee with the Principal, or by informal invitations through S
chool Loop or school
-
wide phone calls. Sowers Middle School also publishes a parent 
information newsletter (The Viking Voice) which compiles information received from staff, administration, and the school comm
unity regarding recent 
or upcoming events, prog
rams, and celebrations. Annually,  the district completed a comprehensive survey for all schools. The survey included questio
ns 
on program, environment, and academics.  It also allowed for parents to provide additional feedback.  In reviewing data with 
sta
ff and parents, there is 
a strong commitment to on
-
going and continued improvement of our students' performance. Parents are proud of the growth Sowers has made in the 
past, and it is a priority that we focus on improvement to remain a high
-
performing scho
ol.  The data from this survey was disseminated to school 
leadership teams to use for program changes and shared with the School Site Council, PTSA, and at Coffee with the Principal m
eetings.  Feedback for 
Sowers Middle School was positive but on
-
going fee
dback is implemented to engage parents in the education of their child through more frequent 
surveys.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsio
n rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of 
ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe
 
school plans: 
current status and assessment of school crime; identification of strategies and programs that provide and maintain a
 
high level of school safety; child 
abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notific
ation to teachers; sexual 
harassment and discrimination policy; policies and procedures for the
 
prevention of bullying; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and 
egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and makes any mo
difications as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, were 
reviewed with school and district staff at the beginning of the 2019
-
20 school year. The plan was reviewed and updated with staff and School Site Council 
in early 20
20.
 
 
The district progressively addresses structural needs at each school to ensure facilities are safe and comply with education 
codes as well as building and 
safety regulations. An automated external defibrillator (AED) was installed in the administratio
n building and Mall (cafeteria/ student eating area). A 
$169 million bond (Measure Q) approved in November 2016 provides the necessary funding for District
-
 
wide modernization efforts. Proposed 
improvements to Sowers included modernization of all learning 
spaces, a new gymnasium, a new STEM lab, and perimeter campus fencing to increase 
student safety.

Sowers Middle School is committed to providing best first instruction for all students through the implementation of standard
s
-
based programs, lessons, 
and 
activities that engage students in their learning. Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students are afford
ed an opportunity to meet 
or exceed local and state proficiency levels. In alignment with the district's long
-
range curriculum plan
, staff development opportunities are available for 
teachers, support personnel, administrators, and classified staff. Additionally, staff members are also encouraged to request
 
release time to attend 
conferences, seminars, or training opportunities that w
ill directly impact their instruction to create the most relevant and engaging learning experiences 
for our students. All training and curriculum development at Sowers Middle School revolves around the Common Core State Stand
ards and best practices. 
Teache
rs align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed local and state proficiency levels. Examples 
of professional 
development include Kelly Gallagher (ELA), ELA Textbook Adoption, NGSS training and collaboration, PLC collaboratio
n, and relationship building learning 
experiences with staff.
 
 
Huntington Beach City School District regularly collaborates with all levels of district and school site staff when developin
g professional development 
activities. Instructional program improve
ment is driven by student needs and guided by state standards and frameworks. District and school 
administrators use site trend analyses, state testing, district
-
level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to identify more 
effective
 
methods and strategies to achieve positive results for teachers and students. The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Ser
vices and principals 
meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, instructional materials, implementation timelines, an
d student achievement. Feedback is 
gathered at the site level through direct input and staff observation. The Sowers Middle School staff is continually involved
 
in a process of curriculum 
development and staff training. District goals and objectives, const
ructed in keeping with state frameworks, are used to set achievable benchmarks. Each 
content area, PLC, meets monthly to assess and refine its educational goals. Individual departments, the Viking Leadership Te
am (shared leadership 
group), the principal, a
nd the School Site Council continually monitor the school plan. A major component of the school plan is staff development and
 
collaboration. As needs are identified, training sessions are developed, in keeping with the district's direction, state fram
ework
s, and recommended 
curricula.
 
 
Teachers new to the profession are supported by peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in
-
services offered by the Orange County Department of 
Education. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject
-
specific seminars and majo
r conferences and share what they learn with other staff members. 
These programs offer additional support and opportunities to new teachers. The program is designed to expand and deepen their
 
teaching skills, help 
the school district retain more new teache
rs, and improve learning opportunities for students. Classified staff and instructional assistants are provided 
training and development opportunities at the school, district, and county levels. In
-
services for classified staff are geared to their specialt
y areas.
