About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the B
oard of Trustees has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facili
ties bond to repair, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. Several lunch shade 
structures and age
-
appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student 
classroom furniture was replaced, exterior painting was completed 
and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a g
ym at A
bbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds
 
on a percentage basis
 
to 
assist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are c
ompleted in a timely manner, 
while the Operati
ons staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box" is used to ensur
e efficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely m
anner, the maintenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment
. Some of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodians. The Principal
, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and
 

which are available at the District Office. In addition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Stat
e of California's Office of Public 
School Constructio
n to evaluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site. The following sch

the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Family engagement is a core strategy that Lead has developed and supported in order to ach
ieve its school goals. We encourage parent and guardian 
involvement throughout the school, both formally and informally. Lead families are actively involved in our Lead Parent Teach
er Association (PTA), Parent 
Involvement Project (PIP), English Learner Adv
isory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council (SSC). Families participate in our school climate and culture 
by attending monthly Principal Chats, Student Honor Assemblies, Parent Cafes, PIP parent education workshops, our annual fall
 
and spring Festivals 
and 
an abundance of PTA and Family Engagement events occurring throughout the school year. Families stay engaged by regularly ser
ving as classroom 
volunteers, field trip chaperones, Art in Action docents and recess volunteers. Families receive constant com
munication through our school website, 
outdoor marquee, monthly Principal Newsletter, weekly Thursday packets, School Messenger emails and phone calls, and by using
 
such apps as Class 
Dojo and Konstella. Families team up to raise school funds through the a
nnual San Mateo
-
Foster City Education Foundation Readathon as well as teacher
-
led Lead fundraisers. Lastly, families are active participants in Student Success Teams and the creation of interventions and
 
supports for their children.

creating a safe and caring school community where all students and families feel welcomed, valued and respected. These Guidin
g Principles (respe
ct, 
responsibility, appreciation of differences, honesty, safety and life
-
long learning) communicate the expectations for behavior to students, parents, 
teachers and administrators and are updated and reviewed yearly. The rules were developed to be consist
ent with State Education Code, policies of the 
San Mateo
-
Foster City School District Board of Trustees and the School District's Strategic Plan.
 
 
Comprehensive School Safety Plans, developed individually for each school in conjunction with the San Mateo County Office of 
Education and City 
Services, include disaster preparedness and emergency procedures. The School Safety Plans provide role responsib
ility guidelines and processes required 
to address major emergencies. Annually, the District utilizes the services of School Innovations & Achievement to review each
 

determine if all required components are included and to offer fee
dback and suggestions.
 
 
California Education Code Section 32280 requires school fire evacuation drills, as well as one law enforcement lockdown drill
, and the District organizes 
two District
-
wide drills each year, using different scenarios that test the Bi
g Five Safety Protocols (Shelter in Place, Secure Campus, Drop, Cover and Hold 
On, Lockdown/Barricade and Evacuation). These drills involve a District Command Center for communication with each school/pro

Professional

The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is committed to providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training 
is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during
 
the school year, on early release days and during the 
summer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the
 
implementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Languag
e Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economica
lly Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research from the
 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
angua
ge and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards
 
and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of
 
Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learning communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training 
with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed profession
al learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immedi
ate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and feedback surveys) from teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strate
gies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional 
growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for
 
student successes and
 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then informs the distr

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more spec
ific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District lea
ders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union representatives to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the dist
rict LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this y
ear, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teache
rs also receive additional professional development provided by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
