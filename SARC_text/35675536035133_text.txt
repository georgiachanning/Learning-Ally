About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability 
of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Southside School held a public hearing on October 2, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had sufficient
 
and good quality textbooks 
and instructional materials pursuant to 
the settlement of Williams VS. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are provided their 
own individual standards
-
aligned  textbooks or Instructional materials, or both, in core subjects and in visual and performing arts, for us
e in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use 
by the state are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adop
tion. The table displays information collected in October 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Parents and the community are very supportive 
of the educational program at Southside Elementary School. The school has a very active Parent Club 
and many parents volunteer in various classrooms. Parents are welcome to attend school
-
wide events held throughout the school year. Numerous local 
businesse
s also offer generous support of all the school's programs and activities.
 
 
The Southside School District has made efforts to engage a variety of stakeholders throughout the school year to seek input i
n the planing and analysis 
of the Southside School LCAP
. Public meetings were held with the public hearing date was with board of trustees on 5/29/19 and on 6/5/19.  Meetings 
with the staff to review portions of the document were held on 5/9/19.  A public meeting was held with the Migrant parent org
anization o
n 5/9/19 and 
then with the Migrant Parent board members on 5/30/18. Final board of trustee approval occurred on 6/5/19. The tools and acti
vities listed below were 
used for data collection and stakeholder input to develop the plan. Currently Parents can par
ticipate in the Parent club, the Migrant parent action 
committee, and volunteer opportunities. Parents are contacted each week with school activity updates and with real
-
time messaging.

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Southside School. The school strives to be com
pliant with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining 
to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan is reviewed and updated each year in the f
all. All revisions were 
communicated to both the classified and certificate
d staff. The comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the School to comply with Senate Bill 
187 (SS 187) of 1991. The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Every
 
faculty member is aware 
of thei
r role in case of disaster or potential Run Hide Defend/Active shooter situations. Evacuation routes are posted in every clas
sroom and safety drills 
are held 3
-
4 times per school year.  One administrator and the entire Southside staff monitor the campus fr
om 7:30 a.m. 
-
 
4:00 p.m. daily.  Southside is 
a closed campus and all visitors must register with the office before entering the school.  Southside has a complete and comp

Number of classes indicates how many classrooms fall into each size category (a range of total students per 
classroom). At the secondary school level, this information 
is reported by subject area rather than grade level.
 
 
Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
 
The school offers four staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional growth opportunities in 
curriculum, teaching strategies, and 
methodologies. For the last four years, the school offered four days of staff development. Staff development has 
moved beyond Common Core training and is now focused on interim formative assessments to inform instruction and a new student
 
management 
system
. New teachers are provided support and professional feed back through the New teacher induction program as well as the Peer 
Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program. The current focus of professional development has concentrated on the implementation of the iR
eady diagnostic and intervention 
curriculum.
