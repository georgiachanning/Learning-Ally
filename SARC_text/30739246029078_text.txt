By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School F
acility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Los Alamitos Unified School District has always emphasized the importance of a clean, safe environment for learning. 
The environment of each campus is a matter of pride for students, staff and parents. Several schools have planted 
individual gardens, o
rganized workrooms, and planned workdays for students and parents to enhance the facility. To 
insure that our facilities are in good repair condition, custodians at each site perform monthly inspections and the District
 
maintenance crew places safety as th
e number one priority. Lee Elementary School was built in 
1961
.
 
Overall the school 
is in good condition. It is clean and well maintained. Voters within the District boundaries approved a local bond in 2008. 
Due to the passage of the Measure K Bond in 2008,
 
all school sites within the District were modernized. The modernization 
work included the installation of new roofs, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, fire alarm and data systems. The doors, windows 
and flooring were replaced along with all new restroom fixture
s. The modernization of
 
 
Lee Elementary School was 
completed in 
September 
2013.
 
Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by 
speaking with the school principal.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

as coordinating PTA and Project LEAP activities. The Lee School staff is fortunate to be able to rely on its parent and 
larger communi
ty to help deliver the high quality education planned for students. There are multiple ways that parents 
can and do get involved. Over 200 parent and community volunteers regularly assist the staff in supporting learning 
experiences for students. They part
icipate in activities such as working in the classroom, volunteering on field trips, 
grading papers, tutoring individual students, and working in the media center. Our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is 
extraordinarily active and involved while providing 
significant service and financial support for the overall student 
curricular and social program. 
 
 
 
Social events are built into our calendar to bring our families together, building a sense of community: our Kinder Play 
Date, Popsicle Posting Party, Ice C

School Night and Camp Lee welcome families back to school. 
Multiple evening musical performances highlight the various grade levels, chorus and after

school instrumental music 

 
us at the end of the year. Family nights are held throughout 
the year at various grade levels to promote parent involvement both socially and often in curricular areas of science, 
math, technology
 
 
and language arts. Project LEAP solicits donations throug
h a silent auction event, e
-
scrip donations, 
and family dinner nights. Project
 
LEAP continues to raise significant funds which are used to supplement the core 
instructional program. Both PTA and Project
 
LEAP are always looking for additional parental invol
vement.
 
 
Both 
organizations work together for the benefit of Lee students. Parents can and do continually work with us to identify new 
businesses and other sources of support for Lee. For more information about opportunities for parent involvement at 
Lee,

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each site has a Comprehensive Safe School Plan (CSSP), an Emergency Preparedness Plan, and a Crisis Intervention Plan. 
These three documents cover all aspects of campus safety. The plans are 
on file and available to all parents as well as the 
general public. The CSSP is reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the School Site Council and subsequently Board 
Approved.
 
 
The CSSP is also on file at the Orange County Department of Education. The 
goal is to ensure a healthy, safe 
and drug
-
free environment on all Los Alamitos Unified School District campuses.

(CGI), Readers & Writers Workshop, Reading Foundations for the Common Core (RFCC), Thinking Maps and Depth and 
Complexity.
 
 
Student data is collected via District benchmarks and various formal assessments, such as CAASPP an
d 
Fountas & Pinnel Leveled Reading Assessments, to determine instructional needs for teachers. The District provides annual 
training to ensure accurate calibration in the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in order to assess 
site vs. dis
trict
-
wide areas of concerns. 
 
 
Professional development is delivered by way of release time for teachers in the all of the Signature Practices.
 
 
Teachers 
new to the Los Alamitos Unified School District are placed on a five
-
year professional development plan.
 
 
Teachers are 
placed into co
horts according to the number of years with the District and attend professional development 
sessions.
 
 
Teachers are also released to attend pre
-
approved workshops and conferences with the expectation of 
disseminating their findings by way of instructional
 
networking.
 
 
The District also provides content specific training when 
needed by departments or grade level teams. 
 
 
Teachers are supported through on
-
going, in
-
class coaching by District TOSAs.
 
 
Site administrators provide regular, 
ongoing feedback by con
ducting classroom observations, setting individual goals for teachers, and by providing time for 
teachers to collaborate and review data within grade level teams, subject teams and departments.
 
 
Teachers are provided 
opportunities to participate in instruc
tional networking where teachers observe other teachers and debrief on the 
instructional strategies employed within the lesson.
 
 
The practice of instructional networking is cross
-
curricular and non
-
evaluative.
