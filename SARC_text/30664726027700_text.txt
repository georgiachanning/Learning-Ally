By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Resolution Date: 08/11/15
 
In 2011, the Governor and State Legislature extended the suspension of State Board of Education (SBE) adoptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Arts/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implementation 
of  California'
s Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigor of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developing curricula units, and v
arious resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in November 2015  which directed our pilot and adoption of new 
instructional materials.

Glen H. Dysinger 
Elementary School  welcomes and values parental involvement in District and school site programs and 
committees. Parent involvement promotes stellar educational opportunities for all students within an inspirational 

t program enhances both instruction and special events. Parents participate 
in our strategic planning process in many ways, through their involvement in SSC, ELAC and DELAC advisory groups. These 
groups meet on a regular basis to share information, discuss
 
school programs, evaluate performance data and provide 
input toward school
-
based decision making.  The SSC/ELAC combined committee oversees the development and 
implementation of the school's School Plan for Student Achievement and provides input for the S
afe School Action Plan. 
Many parents regularly volunteer on PTA, School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), and in 
classrooms. The Dysinger PTA supports student learning by funding assemblies, study trips, art and music programs
, and 
book sales. PTA supports community events such as Fall Harvest Carnival, Astronomy Night, and Family Nights. 
Opportunities for parent education and family involvement occur throughout the school year. Parents are encouraged to 
become active participa

Site Council, the English Language Advisory Committee, and various district committees.  Parent information meetings are 
conducted by the principal at SSC, EL
AC, Back to School Night, and Open House and the Principal makes every effort to 
attend all PTA meetings. All parents are encouraged to attend annual and monthly meetings to provide input. School Site 
Council (SSC) and English Language Advisory Committee (
ELAC) schedules meetings to discuss, monitor, and evaluate the 
instructional programs in the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) including GATE, English Learners, Technology, 
Interventions, and Special Education. The PTA Board also meets once a mont
h to discuss and plan many school activities 
like fundraisers, Book Fairs, study trips, Brainpower Mania activities, T
-
Shirt sales, Family Nights, and instructional 
assemblies. GATE parents are invited to a site meeting to inform them of our Gifted and Tal
ented program and assist 

Individualized Gate Plan (IGP.) Award Assemblies are held every trimester to recognize student academic and beh
avior 
achievement, and parents are invited to attend.  The use of our district and school websites, Facebook, Twitter, school 
marquee, weekly principal "School Messenger" phone calls, emails, and text messages, help keep parents informed of 
events at the s

student safety and adherence to rules.
 
1.
 
Dysinger is a Closed Campus. All visitors must report to the office for identification. 100% of non
-
s
taff persons on

To ensure that the playground is a physically safe place for all students.
 
3.
 
Maintain clean and safe bathrooms.
 
4.
 
Provide safe parking lot procedures for efficient student drop off a
nd pick up.
 
 
Goal #2: Glen H. Dysinger School provides for the safety of all students and staff through a well planned and implemented 
crisis response plan.
 
1.
 
To train staff, students, and inform parents of crises response procedures with 100% of the staff c
lear on all 
emergency response procedures, practices, and responsibilities in their designated roles. .
 
2.
 
Ensure that the school has all necessary supplies in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Centralia School District has developed a Disaster Plan for 
emergencies.  Staff members are in
-
serviced and assigned 
responsibilities for plan implementation.  The school and District participate in the annual California Shake Out earthquake 
drill each October.   Fire evacuation drills are held monthly, along with 
bi
-
monthly lockdown and earthquake drills. The 
school maintains a Staff Safety Committee and it meets minimally four times a year to review safety issues, plan staff 
development and makes recommendations for improvement.
 
 
The plan provides students and sta
ff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, 
routine and emergency; policies related to susp
ension and expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; 
provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees; safe and orderly 
school environment; and school rules and procedures.  Annual
ly, the school evaluates and updates the plan. Safety 
procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school and District staff in the fall, at the start
 
of each school year.
 
 
Dysinger School believes that to ensure a positive lea
rning experience requires a safe and orderly environment. Toward 
this end, we have established an Award winning school
-
wide Positive Behavior and Intervention Support (PBIS) Program 
which communicates high expectations for student behavior. Each student re
ceives training on behavior expectations in 
the classroom, at Flag Ceremony, during a schoolwide Implementation Day, and in school assemblies lead by the principal.  
Dysinger students are expected to embrace the F.I.R.E. attributes (Focused on safety, acti
ng with Integrity, being 
Respectful and Responsible, and being Engaged learners) Teachers teach, monitor, enforce and exhibit positive attributes 
throughout the year. The school follows all District Board Policies including those pertaining to Safety, Susp
ension, 
Expulsion and Mandatory Expulsion and Sexual Harassment.
 
 
The Centralia School District's Board of Trustees reviews the Safe School Action Plan annually by March 1st.
