By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improveme
nts (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Elbow Creek Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and
 
learning. This 
includes space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The res
ults of 
this survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may b
e 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repai
rs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In additi
on to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and 
safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replace
ment of existing school building 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all classrooms and faci
lities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
This year, there were several improvements made to school facilities. The cafeteria walls were redone and last year, a new 
building that inc
luded upper grade bathrooms and workroom was demolished and rebuilt.  Several old trees where 
removed and many trees were pruned.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

20)
 
 
Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Elbow Creek Elementary School continually 
strives to involve parents in their child's educational experience by sharing information that helps them understand and 
support school programs and by providing o
pportunities for parent participation in school activities. We do this in a 
number of ways.  We invite them to participate in parent
-
teacher conferences twice a year or as needed by each teacher 
and parent, providing fun nights such as Literacy Night, Pare
nts and Pastries Breakfast, Fun Run Day, supporting us during 
our school's track events, our book fairs, our Open House, and other school events.
 
 
There are other varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to volunteering in cla
ssrooms, PTO, 
and chaperoning field trips. Parents may also serve on advisory committees, including, the English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), School Safety Committee, School Site Council (SSC), and SMART Schools.   Additional opportunities for 
parent
al involvement also exist at the district level such as Parent University classes.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Elbow Creek Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school
 
grounds before, during, and after school. Entrances to school grounds are secured or 
monitored during the school day. All gates are locked during the school day.  All visitors must sign in at the office and wea
r 
appropriate identification while on campus.
  
Parent volunteers must participate in special orientation providing them with 
important information in order to volunteer at our school or participate in fieldtrips.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school
 
environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed
 
annually, updated 
as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office.

The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by school 
data.  Our district provides professional 
development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroom level dependent on teacher 
goals.   The district 
provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified 
offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Insti
tute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement a
nd cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings
 
with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tou
rs, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mento
rs and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction C
lear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.

eded in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
 
 
At Elbow Creek, Staff participates in professional dev
elopment on minimum days and focus on identified areas of need 
such as Reading, Math and specifically working with struggling learners.  We identify best teaching practices and 
collaborate in grade levels and grade level spans on developing effective lesso
ns to target student demographic groups 
who are struggling meeting and exceeding standards.  In addition, teachers have a choice of participating in staff 
development offered by our district during the summer and winter break.
