About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year,
 
every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
a
ll local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities
. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and 
Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 

ualified, professional trade specialists. Emergency situations are immediately resolved either by the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and 
with the pri
ncipal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian, principal, a
nd assistant principal inspect facilities for safety hazards, 
vandalism, and other conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and c
leanliness are the 


cleaning procedures, use of chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established 
set of cleaning standards 
and p
rioritization procedures for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measur
e in keeping 
facilities well stocked, safe, and sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classroom
s, office areas, and restrooms. 
Groundskeepers are dispatched by the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields,
 
and irrigation systems.

State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

All curriculum and instructional improvement activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are aligned to Common Core State
 
Standards. Staff 
development concentrations are selected and identified based 
upon student assessment results, teacher input, state content standards, and professional 
development surveys.  Staff development activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are focused on increasing student lea
rning and proficiency. During 
the 2019
-
20
 
school year, our school/district sponsored three days of staff development focusing on social emotional learning, school safe
ty, and 
curriculum.  Throughout the school year, certificated staff members have engaged in multiple professional development oppo
rtunities offered by Santa 
Ana Unified School District, OCDE and AVID. Training activities have taken place throughout the school year, after school, an
d during the summer and 
have generally focused on best practices in teaching and learning, methodologies
, and MTSS (Multi Tiered Systems and Supports) practices.
 
 
New teachers are supported by experienced teachers, resource staff, and extensive staff development. The TIPS Induction Progr
am (Teacher Induction 
and Professional Support) is a state
-
approved prog
ram that offers additional support and assistance to newly credentialed teachers. All new teachers are 
assigned to a Support Provider (mentor teacher) and provided individualized support over a two
-
year period. More information about the TIPS Induction 
Pro
gram is available on www.sausdtips.org.  To support veteran teachers as well as new teachers to the district, Santa Ana Unifi
ed School District offers 
Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) which is easily defined as teachers helping teachers. Experienced and kn
owledgeable veteran teachers, referred to a s 
Consulting Teachers, provide ongoing assistance to teachers who need to improve their instructional skills, classroom managem
ent strategies, subject 
knowledge, and/or related aspects of their teaching performan
ce.
