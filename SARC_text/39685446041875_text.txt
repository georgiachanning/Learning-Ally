By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
 
The purpose of the School Accountability Report Card (SARC) is to provide parents and the community with information 
about our school, its resources, successes and the areas of improvement. Our
 
purpose is to foster understanding and 
support for Jefferson School through awareness of accountability programs for student achievement and the processes 
used to meet those standards and goals. This SARC is published annually. The statistics reported are
 
from the 2018
-
19 
school year unless otherwise noted. In some cases, comparison data covering three consecutive years is provided.
 
 
As the Jefferson School District has grown, Jefferson School has always held on to three characteristics that have made it 
o
ne of the best schools in Tracy: high
-
quality teaching, strong community involvement and high academic standards for 
all students. Teachers at Jefferson work long hours and go the extra mile to help children learn the content standards, and 
something about
 
life. Jefferson has stayed true to its tradition of the community by remaining a close
-
knit campus. This is 

families. Jefferson students go
 
on to be successful in high school, college and the professional world.
 
 
Our goals for the 2018
-
19 school year involved teachers being lifelong learners and collaborating to research best 
practices. A team of Jefferson School teacher leaders attended a th
ree
-
day Professional Learning Community (PLC) 
conference over the summer of 2016 and again in the summer of 2017 to learn what PLCs are and how they successfully 
function in schools. The Site Leadership Team met throughout the year to make school
-
based dec
isions that are in the 
best interest of the students and based on proven research. Specifically, we are focusing on a Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Supports (MTSS) that encompasses intervening and en
-
riching both academics and behaviors. These team members are 
le
ading small content area teams through a journey of researching best practices, creating SMART goals for student 
learning, creating common formative assessments, comparing data and working together to plan. This was an exciting 
year for us as we moved thro
ugh the initial stages of the PLC process.
 
 
The Jefferson School staff is working even harder this year on implementing the PLC process. We have finalized our school 
mission and vision. Furthermore, we are focusing on individualized intervention and an ove
rall tiered intervention 
program. Through research, we are questioning grading strategies, implementing more common formative assessments, 
reviewing data for reteaching opportunities and working together to reach our mission. Our goal is to meet student ne
eds 
on a by student, by standard basis; meaning we will intervene for each child and for each essential standard they need to 
master. Interventions for English learners (ELs), special population and Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) students will 
be dif
ferentiated in the classroom as well as with outside support. Our efforts are not only to intervene academically; we 
strive to meet behavioral needs as well. Discipline is based on restorative practices and students have multiple 
opportunities and paths to
 
learn from behaviors. Our on
-
site therapist provides students and families support for mental
-
health needs, trauma, etc. All students receive weekly instruction from our adopted character education program, Project 
Wisdom. In return, we recognize students
 
for their appropriate behavior in an effort to create a nurturing and positive 
school climate.

Project. Together they promote 
anti
-
bullying campaigns, encourage students to stand up for what is right, spread 


ASB meetings, which are held weekly on Wednesdays.
 
 
Overall, Jefferson School focuses on the whole child. We know that a balance of academic, mental and social success is 
key for sustained student success. The support for students is endless. Staff 
does what it takes to help all students. I am 
privileged to serve as the principal of Jefferson School and look forward to a successful year.

2. We then form a 
committee of administrators, teachers (representatives from all grade levels) and parents.
 
 
3. The committee reviews, researches and identifies essential K
-
8 curriculum and assesses needs.
 
 
4. The committee establishes consensus on the most important crite
ria to evaluate during initial screening.
 
 
5. Depending on how many textbook programs have been approved, we make arrangements to preview samples. An initial 
preview may be necessary to determine whether the committee needs to preview all samples. All text
books are from the 
state
-
approved list.
 
 
6. The committee conducts evaluations, pilots, reviews, and shares the conclusions with administrators and staff.
 
 
7. Community members are invited to review curriculum and provide feedback.
 
 
8. The 
committee submits its recommendation to the school board for approval and, finally, implements the new program, 
monitors, and modifies or supplements when necessary.
 
 
9. The district has affirmed that each pupil, including English learners, has his or her 
own textbook to use in class and to 
take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Jefferson School District is firmly committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. In order 
to achieve this goal, Jefferson School D
istrict has developed an Injury and Illness Prevention Program for all employees to 
follow. It is designed to minimize workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses. By making employee safety a high priority for
 
every employee, we can reduce injuries and ill
nesses, increase productivity, and promote a safer and healthier 
environment for all individuals in the Jefferson School District. Hazard and safety awareness helps to provide a secure, 
peaceful and clean environment for the school community.
 
 
The 

Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis.
 
 
At Jefferson School District, every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on c
ampus throughout the school 
day.
 
Yard supervisors, teachers, site administrators and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school. 
All visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on campus and must d
isplay their passes at all 
times. We recently added an Ident
-
A
-
Kid visitor management system on campus. This system makes it easier to track 
visitors and volunteers. Furthermore, it requires parents to digitally check their child in and out for a more accu
rate 
account of children on campus.

A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. Two full
-
time custodians and one 
part
-
time custodian take great pride in maintaining organized, clean and safe facilities at Jeffers
on. Jefferson School 

ensures the school facilities are in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. A schedul
ed 
maintenance program is administered by Jefferson School District to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms and facilities 
are well maintained and in good repair.
 
 
The district was formed in June 1870 with a small schoolhouse. The current school site was 
first built in 1929 and 
remodeled in 1954 and 1966. Jefferson School originally had 20 classrooms, a gymnasium, library, computer lab, science 
lab, cafeteria, band room, maintenance shop, bus barn and three baseball diamonds.
 
 
In 2010, a school facilities 
bond was passed. This bond provided Jefferson School with a new main office building and 
classrooms, gymnasium, kitchen, playground and track area with space for multiple courts and activities, music and 
theater area attached to the gym stage, state of the
 
art library, and modernized science labs. Furthermore, all classrooms 
are set up with smart projectors and students have Chromebooks in each classroom. This construction included a new fire 
and intrusion alarm system. To support the new fire and irrigatio
n systems, a new well was drilled and a 125,000
-
gallon 
tank sits on the back of the property. The design of the school offers room for expansion in the future if needed.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the
 
total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

We are grateful to have a wonderful Parent Faculty Association (PFA) that is dedicated to serving the Jefferson and 
Monticello Elementary School communities. Our PFA has been actively devoting their time to organi
zing and developing 
special projects and events that benefit all students. The main fundraiser for the PFA is the School Carnival. Parents who 
are not yet members are always encouraged to join this amazing group. Meetings are held regularly, alternating be
tween 
Jefferson and Monticello Elementary School.
 
 
Parents can also get involved with the following: English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), School Site Council, GATE 
activities, Safety Team, graduation committees, and classroom and school function volu
nteering. We welcome parents to 
be on our campus and to help throughout the year.
 
 
Recently Jefferson School installed a digital marquee. This will be used to celebrate school successes and as another 
platform to inform students and families of 
upcoming events. Furthermore, families receive a weekly newsletter 
highlighting our campus and how to be involved.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Jefferson School maintains a school safety plan, which is updated annually by the Safety Committee, whose members 
include administrators, employees, parents and local law enforcement. A high priority is placed on disaster preparedness.
 
 
The district requir
es monthly fire drills and other emergency drills (earthquake, lockdown) be held to prepare students in 
the event of a genuine emergency. Staff also debriefs after every drill to troubleshoot for future emergency situations. A 
complete emergency procedures
 
guide is posted in each classroom, the office and the staff room, describing procedures 
for emergency situations. All school buildings are equipped with back
-
packs containing emergency and first
-
aid supplies. 
We reviewed, updated and discussed the school 
safety plan with the school faculty in August 2019 and again in November 
of 2019. We use our safety plan, along with fire and earthquake drills, at each site. The school safety committee walks the 
campus with a local officer, and discusses areas for improv
ement and makes those improvements. Furthermore, the fire 
inspector attends at least one drill each year to ensure we are keeping students safe, are as prepared as possible for 
emergencies, and that the responders (alarm company and officials) respond appr
opriately.

We encourage teachers to attend outside conferences and workshops to further their education and stay current in recent 
educational research. Minimum days are scheduled throughout the year for teachers to par
-
ticipate in ongoing staff 
development at both t
he site and district levels. Teachers participate in ongoing staff development at the site as well as 
the county level. Professional
-
development methods include: after
-
school workshops, conferences, and individual 
mentoring and coaching. Teachers have part
icipated in Common Core English language arts, math, writing, Guided 
Language Acquisition Design (GLAD), meeting the needs of special populations, technology training and district 
instructional norms. Grade
-
level collaboration teams also worked together to
 
develop Common Core
-
aligned instructional 
guides, assessments and professional learning community collaboration.
