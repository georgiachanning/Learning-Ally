Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Poway Unified School District ensures that students attend cl
ean and safe facilities.  In accordance with Education 
Code Section 17070.75(e), the District uses a School Facilities Inspection System developed by the State of California to 
ensure that each of its schools is maintained in good repair.  A work order pro
cess is used to ensure efficient service and 
that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.  Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices and 
bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Playgrounds and fields are ample and well maintained
.  A full time custodian 
is on every campus throughout every school day.  A night custodial crew cleans classrooms, restrooms and offices daily.  
The district has adopted cleaning standards for all schools.  A summary of these standards is available at the
 
district offices.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Painted Rock Elementary school places a strong emphasis on safety for students and staff in order to provide a safe, 
respectful, accepting and emotionally nurturing educational climate and provide each student resiliency skills. At Painted 
Rock, staff, stu
dents and parents work collaboratively to ensure a safe and secure environment. The principal provides 
ongoing training to staff, including noon supervisors, on teaching and monitoring children to be "fair and safe". We are 
fortunate to have a school couns
elor two days a week and a Student Services Assistant 15 hours a week. The counselor 
teaches character lessons and
 
 
works with referred students who need assistance in social skills. She works 1:1 or in small 
groups. The Student Service Assistant provides 
character lessons and helps students problem solve on the playground.
  
 
Our 
caring front office staff provides support for students on a daily basis. Emergency plans are reviewed frequently. Annual 
training procedures and drills for earthquakes, lock downs
, and fire and bus evacuation are held. We debrief after each 
drill, lessons learned.
 
 
The district maintains a collaborative relationship with local law enforcement and the Office of Emergency Services to 
ensure optimal preparedness. In collaboration with
 
our law enforcement we adjusted the parking lot traffic flow and added 
appropriate supervision to a safe parking lot at the start and end of the school day. 
 
 
Maintenance staff
 
 
work with a scheduled preventive program to offset costly repairs at our olde
r sites, whenever possible. 
The school has an up to date Asbestos Plan. Extended Student Services is available to students for before and after school 
childcare.
