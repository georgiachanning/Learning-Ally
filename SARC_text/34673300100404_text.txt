By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School & Community Profile:
 
Sandra J. Gallardo is an elementary school in Folsom, California, serving Kindergarten through 5th grade. Our student

Teachers regularly participate in professional development and collaborative opportunities through our Professional

that serve the individual academic 
needs including Speech, Occupational Therapy,and Intervention Programs. Opportunities for differentiated learning help 
to provide challenges for all students, including those identified for GATE. Additionally, we support
 
English learners with

improve learner outcomes. As we develop our Sci
ence, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) Program , teachers and 
parents bring science exploration to the classroom. Additionally, students participate in Student Council, STEM Night, 
Science Fair, Math Bowl, Cross Country and other social events during t
he school year.

counseling and/or inter
ventions participate in the Primary Intervention Program (PIP) also known as Special Friends.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sandra J. Gallardo Elementary was originally constructed in 2003 and is comprised of 28 classrooms
, a multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, a library, a staff lounge, a  computer lab, two learning centers and two playgrounds. Recent remodeling 
included the addition of a second student care facility.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The Principal works daily with the custodia
l staff of three employees (two full time and one half time) 
to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The District governing board 
has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summ
ary of these standards are available at the District 
office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority are given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are 
reported in the inspection process. The items noted in the table have been corrected
 
or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget: The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for ma
jor repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
This school has been greatly enriched with tremendous parental involvement.  Our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) has 
organized fundraisers from the beginning of the year to be sure our students would have the advantages of an established 
campus. Frequent 
events at no cost are available during the evening for families to participate in at school.  Some examples 
include a school
-
wide family picnic (Gators on the Green), Math Night, STEM Night, and Movie Night.  Volunteering 
regularly in classrooms has meant 
that our students have been able to have additional assistance in their learning 
activities. Family activities have been a delight for all and have been an arena to make new friends and become familiar 
with the school staff.
 
 
Our Fine Arts Mini Experience 
(FAME) Program encourages all parents to become regular volunteers as trained docents 
leading students in music and art experiences. Parental involvement is very high as we work as a team to create a positive 
learning environment for our students.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

Restrooms, eating facilities and kindergarten classrooms are cleaned daily. All other classrooms are cleaned every third 
day. Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and resolved. Safety plans are reviewed each Fall and 
Spring. Emergency
 
plans have been developed in case a threatening situation should arise.
 
 
Our school has worked with the District and Folsom Fire Department to develop an evacuation plan. Our staff has been 
trained and continues to be trained, to respond to a variety of e
mergency situations. Students regularly practice how to 
evacuate the school, as well as practice additional drills in the case of a variety of emergencies. Classrooms have 
evacuation routes posted at the exits. It is required that all visitors check in to 
the office before entering the campus. 
Safety is one of our highest priorities at Sandra J. Gallardo Elementary. In 2018
-
2019, there were 18 student accidents, 
and our 2019
