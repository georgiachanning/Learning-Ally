Teachers, staff, and administrators continue to act on the principle that students come first. 
Katherine Smith Elementary School opened in 1962 and over the last
 
fifty years has had a rich and 
diverse history with the Evergreen School District. The second school established in the District, it 
has been recognized as both a California Distinguished School (1987 and 2002) and a National Blue 
Ribbon School of Excelle
nce (1988). Looking to the future, our children need to be prepared for an 
ever changing world. Katherine Smith School has been redesigned with that mission in mind

to 
create the most engaging and excellent education for our children

an education to serve 
them in 
the twenty
-
first century where we need to communicate, think critically, collaborate, and be 
innovative.
 
 
At Katherine Smith, we want to preserve the great tradition of this school while creating an 
innovative and fresh environment that looks to th
e future for inspiration. Staff at Katherine Smith 
dedicate themselves to a consistently improving the curriculum to engage students through 
purposeful, project
-
based approaches, integrating instructional technology to enact new 
knowledge, and creating a s
trong school culture to empower children to be great citizens of the 
world.  We are creating thinkers, learners, workers, communicators, collaborators, and 
contributors who will be ready to take on any challenge in this ever changing world.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearin
g on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, 
are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the Californ
ia State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in Sept
ember 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The Calif
ornia State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review materials
 
in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017
 
public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Katherine Smith Elementary School was 
originally constructed in 1962. School facilities are currently comprised of 20 permanent classrooms, 15 portable 
classrooms, a S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) lab, a library, two staff parking lots, drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas, and a 
recently 
constructed office and library.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Katherine Smith Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has
 
adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic clea
ning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

l 
staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

th h
eavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to
 
ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues ar
ise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given 
the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provi
des state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
sy
stems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided schoo
l districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining sta
te revenues, the Evergreen School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good repair.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligi
ble students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Katherine Smith Elementary School. Students are supervised before sc
hool and after school by 
teachers and administrators. Lunch and recess supervision is provided by noon
-
duty aides. All visitors to 
the campus must sign in at the main office and 
wear a visitor

s pass at all times during their stay on school grounds. There is also a designated area for student drop
-
off and pick
-
up at the front of the 
school.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was last review
ed and updated in February 2019 by the Emergency Response Team (ERT) and school safety committee. It will 
be reviewed again this winter with a revision submission date of February 7, 2020. Any and all revisions to the plan are imme
diately communicated to 
c
lassified and certificated staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following:
 

 
School rules, expectation, and procedures
 

 
Sexual harassment policy
 

 
Current status of school crime
 

 
Notification to teachers
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures

are conducted monthly on a 
rotating basis throughout the school year

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences, workshops, and staff development meeti
ngs throughout the year. 
For the past three years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers 
are offered a broad
-
based variety of 
professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies which include innovative STEM (Scienc
e, Technology, 
Engineering, and Math) and PBL (Project
-
Based Learning) to increase critical th
inking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.
 
 
We have a commitment to continuous improvement. Every faculty member participates in five to ten hours monthly in professiona
l development focused 
in one of four areas: deeper learning, personalized le
arning, social emotional learning, and family and community resources and supports. Three full days 
without students are used to deliver trainings as well as meeting every Wednesday as an entire faculty. Every Thursday aftern
oon is used for grade
-
level 
spe
cific learning and planning. Teachers also periodically use substitute release to design projects, conduct instructional roun
ds (peer classroom visits), 
use recent data to assess student needs to plan small group instruction, and extend learning through co
aching opportunities.
