About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, a
nd functional. To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at 
the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 
Sunn

ion, we have a cafeteria, 
library, staff lounge, and computer lab. There are a total of 24 classrooms

20 are permanent and 4 are re
-
locatable.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emerge
ncy repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is 
available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Oper
ations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still 
dedicated to maintaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrica
l, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940
,000 for deferred maintenance projects.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Projects
 
Design work has begun to repair the walkway covers throughout the campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority
: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sma
rter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
