Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

driven instruction cycles, and aren

to struggle, so long as we learn from it.
 

 
Exemplary Citizenship: In order to thrive, Nystrom students must develop character and academic skills. We 
explicitly teach our core values of kindness, hope, perseverance, self
-

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT
) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emerge
ncy repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Nystrom provides a variety of 
ways for parents to be involved:
 

 
We host citizenship classes and ESL classes in partnership with the Adult Education Dept.
 

 
Parent University is a series of workshops where parents can learn about how to support their child's education 
and be involved in sc
hool decision making.
 

 
Monthly Coffee Chats: These are opportunities for parents and families to learn about available community 
resources.
 

 
School Site Council (SSC): The role of the SSC is to give parents, faculty, and staff the opportunity to collaborate,
 
give input and make crucial decisions that promote and benefit student learning and achievement school
-
wide. 
Every School Site Council must be composed of five parents or community members, the principal, three 
classroom teachers, and one other staff memb
er (Education Code Section 52852). The SSC's primary 
responsibility is to develop, implement, revise, and monitor the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.
 

 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC): The ELAC discusses issues relevant to English Language Le
arners. 
This committee is an advisory board to the principal and School Site Council.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is 
to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, di
saster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.

During 2019/20 Nystrom's professional development focus is teacher collaboration focused on data
-
driven instruction. 
Data
-
Driven Instruction is a 
philosophy predicated on one question: are students learning? Using data, we are able to 
analyze what our students have learned by looking at ongoing (formative) data sources and use that to decide our next 
steps.
 
 
Instructionally, our focus is on justific
ation, meaning students explain their thinking both when they are correct and 
incorrect. The answer isn't the end goal 
-
 

what you're thinking 
-
 
can expand on it, adjust misconce
ptions.
 
 
These focus areas were developed with our Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) reviewing student data and progress on 
both interim and summative assessments.
 

 
The site
-
based math coach provides ongoing and regular coaching and feedback for targeted 
grade levels.
 

 
Regular professional development for the entire staff on CCSS
-
best practices, including multiple methods, data 
analysis training, etc.
 

 
Increased number of professional developments through optional PDs for staff.
 

 
Regular data
-
analysis meeting
s with grade
-
level teams to review common assessment data and create action 
plans.
 

 
Grade level planning days each trimester for grade levels to review data and develop an action plan.
 
Additionally, teachers have access to a wide range of Professional Devel
opments through the district.
