About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pu
blish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepa
re a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consiste
nt with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information 
about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

e extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have
 
been provided to students. The Board of Education adopted Resolution 2019/2020
-
18 which certifies as required by 
Education Code 60119 that (1) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials have been provided to each student, including 
English learners,
 
that are 
aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with the cycles and context of the curriculum frameworks in the foll
owing subjects: 
history/social science, mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, (2) sufficient textbooks or inst
ructional materials were provided to each pupil 
enrolled in foreign language and/or health classes, (3) laboratory equipment was available for science laboratory classes off
ered in grades 9
-
12, inclusive.
 
 
Textbooks and instructional materials are provided
 
for each student for use in class and to take home. It was determined that each pupil in each school 
has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials that are aligned to the academic content standards in the core subject a
reas for the 2019/2020 school
 
year. Additionally, sufficient textbooks and/or instructional materials were provided to each pupil for visual and performing
 
arts.*Please note: In 
reference to materials not from a most recent State Board Adoption (SBE): In November 2017, the California 
State Board of Education approved a list of 
History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE lis
t to consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of paramount importa
nce to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact safely. At the 
e
nd of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a reg
ular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and carried out durin
g breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A recently completed s
chool improvement for this 
site was the schoolwide keyless access system comp
leted in the 2018/2019 school year and a schoolwide security camera system planned in the 
2019/2020 school year.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the school
 
sites on a conti
nual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete all work orders in
 
a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to record inspection results.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environment that fosters health and safety, in both for
m and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Prepare

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect a
ll students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff
 
members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency management, and public health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in
 
accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to critical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School Distri
ct Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles and responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. The Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimu
m requirements for 
school and site plans
 
throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Regulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Governmen
t Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
