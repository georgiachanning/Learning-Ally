About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Rep
ort Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountabi
lity Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC
.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the C
DE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district 
office.

Southern Kern Unified School District held a public hearing on October 3, 2018, and determined that each school within the di
strict had sufficient and 
good quality textbooks, instructiona
l materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subj
ects for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approv
ed for use by the state are reviewed by all teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende
d materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office pr
ior to adoption. The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the 
standards

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
