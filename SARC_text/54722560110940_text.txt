By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cottonwood Creek Elementary School 
takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This 
includes space provided by classrooms, playgrou
nds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are available at the district office. Addit
ional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working orde
r are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
In 2018
-
19, there were no major maintenance or repair projects at Cottonwood Creek Elementary School. N
o other 
emergency facilities needs exist at this school.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleaning. District and school maintenance 
staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a
 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
pa
inting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to ensure the success of students in our school. Cottonwood Creek 
Elementary School continually strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support 
school programs and by providing opportu
nities for parent participation in school activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to: attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, an
d chaperoning field trips. Parents 
may also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learners Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), PTA Board, and School Site Council (SSC). Our School Smarts Academy, Kindergarten 
Workshops, and 
Koffee Klatches also provide opportunities for parent involvement. Additional opportunities for parental involvement also 
exist at the district level.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Ensuring the safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Cottonwood Creek Elementary School. The 
Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and ensuring 
preparedness for unforeseen emergencies. 
This plan identifies and addresses any security needs, prevention and 
intervention strategies, evaluation of physical facilities, and plans for communicating with staff and students. The safety 
plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and fully compli
ant with state and federal regulations. This plan is updated 
and reviewed by faculty and School Site Council during the month of November each school year.  An updated copy is 
available to the public at the school office.
 
 

s plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Emergency 
preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and literacy instruction and other 
areas as indicated by school data.  Our district provides professional 
development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroo
m level dependent on teacher goals.  The district 
provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qu


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Cre
dentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Cer
tificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day work
shop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout 
the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novi
ce teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their ins
tructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in 
the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one
 
mentor support as may be needed in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
