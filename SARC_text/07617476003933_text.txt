By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent 
Year)
 
 
Los Perales Elementary School is currently comprised of eight buildings, including a gymnasium, library, one computer lab, 
a music room, and an after school daycare facility. Through funding provided by Measure V, modernization efforts will 
commenc
e at the beginning of the Summer of 2020 and are anticipated to be completed at the end of the summer. The 
district
-
wide project intends to vastly improve the student experience through such initiatives as renovated classrooms 
and a redesigned main office.
 
Furthermore, outdoor walking paths with worn
-
out concrete and elevated sections are to 
be fixed completely.
 
 
Camino Pablo Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and community members. 
Site custodians ensure a 
sanitary learning space through daily work that is supervised and inspected by site principals on 
a routine basis. All classrooms, restrooms, and athletic centers are prioritized on the regular cleaning schedule. Outside 
trash is collected daily to reduce 
an unwanted animal presence on the school campus. The district recently added modern 
cleaning
-
chemical dispensers in the custodian closets to further guarantee the optimal cleaning agent is utilized for the 
right job. The site principal and custodians work
 
in conjunction with the district Director of Buildings and Grounds to seek 
ways to increase the cleanliness of the LP campus regularly. The school is inspected annually by the Fire Marshal and 
periodically by school site administrators.

poses a threat to student safety. Priorities fo

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are an integral part of the learning community at Los Perales School. Our parent community is well
-
informed and 
articulate, and we make much effort to include parents in all aspects of the functioning of the school. Parents volunteer 
in classrooms,
 
school projects, the cafeteria, and also assist with field trips, class parties, and activities,  and helping at 
home with many projects and assignments. Our PTA offers many opportunities for parents to be involved in school and 
community
-
related events s
uch as serving as committee chairs and members, fundraising activities, legislative action, 
communication to other parents, and school
-
wide clean
-
up days.  The School Site Council, comprised of staff and parents, 
meets regularly to monitor curriculum and i
nstruction, makes suggestions for improvement, and annually approves the 
Single Site Plan for Student Achievement. The Moraga Education Foundation (MEF) raises funds from the community in 
support of selected instructional programs. Our parent community fin
ancially supports school personnel, activities, and 
events through many significant, generous donations.

wide staff development days were scheduled in each of the school years 2015
-
16, 2016
-
17 and 2017
-
18. These 
days were scheduled and held outside the 180
-
day student calendar.  The focus of these professional development days 
in 2018
-
19 was to 
educate teachers, administrators and staff about the new common core state standards, specifically in 
the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), mathematics, and English Language Arts (ELA).  The focus was selected in 
conjunction with the District's LCA
P goals.  In addition, teachers were provided opportunities to attend workshop events 
that focused on learning about common core standards and how their instructional strategies will improve student 
learning.  Release time is provided for teachers to visit
 
other schools, observe other classrooms and collaborate about 
instruction.  The Beginning Teacher Induction Program assigns new teachers with a mentor teacher.  This program is a 
two
-
year mandatory program for all new beginning teachers in the Moraga Scho
ol District. Teachers receive support from 
one another, site administrators, consultants and the MSD teacher on special assignment.
