By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Gorman Joint School District is situated at th
e southern tip of the beautiful Tehachapi Mountains, 60 miles northwest 
of downtown Los Angeles.  The rural setting encompasses 150 square miles of scenic rolling hills bordered on the north 
by the historic Tejon Ranch and on the south by thousands of acre
s of State Recreational Area.
 
 
The District serves the communities of Gorman, Frazier Park, Neenach, Lebec, and Lake of the Woods.  Neighborhoods 
offer a wide range of residential opportunities including many ranch
-
style homes on acreages.  Gorman experien
ces four 
distinct seasons with several light snowfalls each winter.  Residents enjoy a slower and less hectic environment while being 
able to take advantage of the cultural opportunities in Los Angeles.
 
 
Gorman Joint School District has one K
-
8 school with
 
65 students and four teachers.  The small size of Gorman Elementary 
School makes it possible to have an individualized nurturing environment in each classroom where the average class size 
is 24 students.  Gorman Joint School District is designated by the 
State Department of Education as a District of Choice.  
As such many families from surrounding districts enroll their children at Gorman to take advantage of the small school 
environment.
 
 
Gorman Elementary School is committed to improved levels of academi
c performance.  Our teachers are building on this 
success and to plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate a meaningful standards
-
based curriculum for all students. The 
goals, objectives, and activities have been identified and written based on needs expresse
d by students, parents, and staff 
input and are included in our Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP).  These goals, objectives, and activities are 

grade level, 
district, and state standards.  Our dedicated teachers are committed to high levels of teaching and learning and are 
involved in professional development training designed to strengthen their teaching skills.
 
 
The demographics of the District 
are as follows:  38% Hispanic, 48% White, 3% American Indian, 2% African American, 3% 
Asian, and 6% unknown.  20% of the student population is English Language Learners and 72% receive free or reduced
-
price meals.
 
 
The Gorman Joint School District is known
 


 
 
The mission of Gorman Elementary School is to provide a safe and 
caring climate in which all students will accept 
responsibility for their own actions, show respect for themselves and others, and become intentional learners in order to 
cooperate with the learning process.  Staff, parents, and students will have high exp
ectations and standards for teaching 
and learning.
 
 
Gorman's School Plan offers the on
-
going opportunity to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate a meaningful common 
core curriculum for all students.  The goals, objectives, and activities have been identif
ied and written based on needs 
expressed by students, parent, and staff input.  These goals, objectives, and activities are established to improve and focus
 
instruction at Gorman Elementary School enabling students to meet grade level, district and state s
tandards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Gorman Elementary School places a strong 
emphasis on ensuring the safety of all students and staff members.  Adult aides 
are employed to supervise students before school, at recess and lunch. Fire and earthquake drills are conducted monthly.  
Our campus is completely fenced, with one secure main 
entrance and two secondary entrances that are only open at 
specific times in the morning and afternoon.  Staff is assigned supervision of the grounds and gates when our students 
arrive and leave school.
 
 

es are in compliance with all federal and state and safety regulations.  
Each year a deep cleaning process occurs during the close of school, either during the summer or other extended breaks.  
In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principal noti
fies appropriate site and district personnel to resolve the 
emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon the site emergency preparedness plan.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school 
day.  Campus supervisors, 
teachers, site administrator, and school staff provide supervision for students before and during school.  The playground 
is safe for all students.  All visitors must sign in at the office and receive proper authorization to be on
 
campus, and must 
display their passes at all times.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may
 
participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
