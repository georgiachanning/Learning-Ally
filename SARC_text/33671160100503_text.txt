By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

on with our 
parents and educational partners, we are committed to academic excellence built upon a foundation of equality and 
personal responsibility.
 
 
FCE opened its doors to students in July of 2003 and is now serving approximately 720 students in kinder
garten through 
fifth grade. Our commitment to high levels of learning requires a balance of academic rigor and sensitivity to nurturing 

-
emotional growth.
 
 
Our teachers take pride in their use of current state and school district developed curriculum standards, as well as the 
latest researched

Learning Community
 
(PLC) model, where interdependent grade
-
level teams collaboratively work as a team to plans that 
address the needs of all students. Our focus is to improve student achievement. Common assessments provide 
information on what and how our students learn. Thr
ough results
-
oriented efforts, achievement data is used to determine 
the instructional impact. Freedom Crest Elementary School provides standards
-
based education that nurtures each 

ositive contributors to society. Students 
benefit from our focus on a standards
-
based curriculum, which promotes critical thinking and academic success for all 
students.
 
 
Freedom Crest Elementary School provides a safe and welcoming environment for student
s through the Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support (PBIS) model. We believe that if we explicitly and systematically teach, acknowledge, and expect 
appropriate behaviors, we will be proactive in building a positive, safe, and orderly environment for 
students.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
 
At Freedom Crest Elementary School, we are committed to providing a standards
-
driven curriculum in a safe and orderly 
environment that promotes excellence and values. We believe every child is an individual of great worth, and
 
we will 
equip them with skills and strategies to be lifelong learners in an ever
-
changing world. Our focus on the four essential 
questions of learning:
 
 
1.
 
What do we want students to learn?
 
 
2.
 
How do we know if they have learned it?
 
 
3.
 
What do we do with the 

 
 
4.
 
What do we do for the children that already knew it?

comprehensive scheduled preventative and deferred maintenance program to offset costly repairs 
and minimize 
disruptions to the instructional program.  The district maintenance staff ensures that the maintenance necessary to keep 
the school in good repair is completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure services and emergency 
r
epairs are given high priority. A complete and thorough facility inspection is done annually to identify future areas to 
address and prioritize facility needs.
 
 
In accordance with Ed. Code Section 17070.75 (e), the district uses a facility inspection syste
m to ensure each of its schools 
are maintained and in good repair. A work order process is used to coordinate service and to address emergency repairs 
immediately. A full
-
time custodian is on campus throughout every school day. A night custodial crew clean
s classrooms 
and office areas daily.  The custodial staff has developed a cleaning schedule to ensure a neat and orderly campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the FCE Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emerg
ency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, follo
wing each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
FCE staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocol
s, which include a leveled/colored 

-
in using our Raptor 
system. FCE Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly 
emergency drills and 
provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappro
priate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All FCE staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is 
geared to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determina
tions 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have
 
been on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are
 
provided before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and 
administrators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
