School Description
 
Welcome to Patterson Elementary School, where we are committed to providing an excellent 
educational program to allow all students the opportunity to reach their fullest potential.  At 
Patterson we tak
e this charge seriously and work collaboratively to support all children achieving 
success through an innovative curriculum and instructional strategies. The school was first built in 
1964 with three main buildings. A few years ago, a shelter was added to 
provide additional space 
for students to eat lunch. In 2017, Patterson opened the first new building in 43 years. The building 
is beautiful and has eight gorgeous classrooms. It's a two story building with the most advanced 
technology on campus. It is equi
pped to house up to 240 students of 4th through 6th graders with 
a ratio of 30 to 1. However, it is housing 4 second grade classes with 24 to 1 and 4 third grade 
classes of 28 to 1 for a total of 208 students. The 2018
-
19 school year has seen an increase i
n 
student population. At capacity we can house approximately 900 students but are currently around 
775. We have the following classes 2 TK, 5 Kinder, 4 first grade, 4 second, 3.5third, 3.5 fourth, 3.5 
fifth, 3.5 sixth, and 2 SDC. Our staffing includes a sp
eech therapist, resource teacher, psychologist, 
counselor, school nurse, a library media specialist, one computer specialist, one science specialist, 
1 full time P.E teacher, 1 .6 P.E.teacher. We are supported by an office secretary, an office assistant, 
1
 
a.m. custodian and 2 p.m. custodians. There are a host of parent volunteers and 9 noon 
supervisors to provide supervision during our student lunches. Together, we are working to ensure 
that every child has the opportunity to succeed and reach their fulles
t potential. We have 
implemented The Eight Great Traits Program and we hold weekly morning assemblies in which we 
reinforce the trait of the month. We believe that recognizing our students' efforts will motivate 
them and encourage them to continue to reach
 
success. We have monthly school
-
wide character 
assemblies and quarterly recognition assemblies. Our students can also participate in basketball 
and soccer during the year as we take part of the districts' sport leagues. We strive each and every 
day to pro
vide our students with a quality education which will prepare them to be global citizen.
 
 
We have an active PTA that works with the teaching staff in a collaborative forum to bring high 
interest and motivating assemblies to our school.  The PTA 
sponsors hands
-
on, curriculum
-
based 
field trips for each grade level.  They provide additional support to each teacher, who is a member 
of our PTA, through a monetary donation.  Students are afforded the opportunity to participate in 
array of different act
ivities during the school day. PTA also sponsors our fall and winter festivals, 
Panther Prowl fundraiser, Make A Difference Day, and teacher and staff recognitions. They are 
working to ensure that in two years every Patterson student will have a technology
 
device. Our 
partnership helps move our school forward and provides diverse learning opportunities.
 
 
Mission Statement: Patterson Elementary provides a challenging and innovative learning 
environment where students have the opportunity to develop their pot
ential as: (1) creative 
problem solvers, and (2) compassionate leaders and change makers. Based on students' needs, 
researched best practices and results from assessments and surveys, differentiated instruction, 
students will improve their academic achieve
ment in an innovative and collaborative environment. 
Students will be empowered to advocate for their own education and be active participants in their 
academic, emotional and social growth in preparation to meet challenges of living in a fast ever 
changin
g world. Mutual respect for our culturally diverse community is established and ongoing 
through effective communication between families, students and staff.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about th
e LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or t
he 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year
 
2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Conte
nt Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Patterson Elementary was opened in 1964 with two buildings, consisting of a five
-
classroom and a three classroom building.  Today, school has the 
capacity to house approximately 900 students.  Patterso
n has allocated one room for resources and another for multiple
-
student support such as art, 
reading lab,a leveled reading library, and that same room houses our psychologist two days per week and our counselor two day
s per week.  The facility 
is in good r
epair.  The site was retrofitted in the spring of 2008, with several restroom improvements.  The library was expanded, and th
e multipurpose 
room and library are now air
-
conditioned spaces.  A new roof was installed, with fire alarms upgraded throughout the
 
facility. We currently have all but 
three classrooms in use. Different organizations use our facilities after school to provide our students with different enric
hment opportunities.
 
 
Our landscaping was upgraded with the irrigation system replaced in the 
front area of the school.  The replacement of tattered wooden benches with 
vinyl
-
coated benches, installation of a new clock and new bell system were also completed during the academic year. During our Make
 
A Difference Day 
2018, we had planters installed 
with different plants for our students and staff to enjoy. The front of the school was also improved by adding new plants 
and drought friendly plants in order to improve the beauty of our school.To improve our access to the Internet, the site is n
ow wirele
ss which allows staff 
and students more opportunity to enhance our endeavors for life long learning. Our wireless service was updated during the su
mmer to the new district 
infrastructure system. In the fall of 2016 Patterson Elementary was enhanced with th
e addition of an outside shelter to serve as an additional eating area 
for our growing student population. We opened the new two story eight classroom building for the 2017
-
18 school year. It currently houses 4 second 
grade classes and 3.5 third grade clas
ses. In November 2018, we opened a brand new play structure for our TK and K students which will provide them 
with the opportunity to play and learn. There are plans for future improvements for our campus in the near future.
 
 
To determine the condition of 
our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilit
ies 

io
ns you see on this report.  
Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions may have changed.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the 
Smarter Bal

Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who partici

Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
3)
 
The number of studen
ts tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of stu
dents tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are 
calculated using only students who received scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our parents meet regularly as partners in the education of students and support major project
s at the school, as well as volunteering in classrooms and 
participate in various school activities such as field trips through the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  The staff collabo
rates with PTA to provide parent 
education through various events such a
s Pumpkin Patch, Halloween Carnival and PTA Movie Night. The PTA supports the school and students through 
active and promotion of strong school programs and effective school/home partnerships. Parents can also volunteer to serve as
 
noon supervisors, 
classr
oom parents, and in other capacities based on school needs. Parents are active participants in our School Site Council (SSC) 
and are involved in 
helping make decisions for ur school community. The principal holds quarterly parent meetings to discuss studen
t achievement and address parent 
concerns. We believe that communication with the home is essential in supporting students. Patterson sends a weekly voice mes
sage with information 
about the week, monthly newsletter, information on the marquee, and website.

School Safety Plan
 
Teachers and supervisors mo
nitor the playground from 8:15 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. in the morning.  Noon supervisors supervise students during the lunch 
hour for primary and intermediate students.  Primary teachers monitor students during the second recess in the afternoon.  Te
achers are a
ssigned 
afternoon duty supervision at school dismissal for fifteen minutes.
 
 
Teachers review rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground on a daily basis.  Visitors must sign in
 
at the office where they 
receive a brightly colored n
ame tag to wear throughout their stay. In September we held a school
-
wide expectations assembly in which we shared with 
all students the rules and expectations for our school. Teachers have classroom rules and expectations that were sent home at
 
the beginn
ing of the year. 
We have implemented the Eight Great Traits and teachers actively include the trait of the month in their lessons. At this tim
e, Patterson is in the beginning 
stages of implementation of PBIS.
 
 
We last revised our School Safety Plan in Febr
uary 26, 2019. The plan includes procedures for emergencies and exit routes.  The plan is available on our 
school website and a copy is in the office for review.  Our Safety Plan is shared with all staff during a schoolwide staff me
eting.  Safety drills ar
e routinely 
conducted per district requirements.  We offer training for staff on emergency preparedness.
 
 
The district and PTA continues to upgrade supplies for the school in the event of a natural disaster.  Their assistance equip
ped us to sustain 
students and 
staff for a minimum of three days.  Items purchased include water; food, first aid supplies, restroom buckets with sanitary p
acks, and tents, and these 
supplies meet the district guideline for needed emergency supplies.  They are properly stor
ed with key personnel having keys for immediate access.  
Training of upper grade students on how they will assist is ongoing. The district has enhanced our emergency supplies so that
 
we can sustain a minimum 
of 3
-
5 days of necessities.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some 
time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the amoun
t of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
201
7
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
