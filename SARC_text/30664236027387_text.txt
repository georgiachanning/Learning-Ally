By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Patrick Henry School is a pre
-
K through 6th grade walking community school located in the city of Anaheim. Patrick 
Henry was built in 1958. It originally contained twelv
e classrooms and a library, and began with 360 students. Currently, 

 
 

 
The Patrick Henry School community believes that all children can learn and 
is committed to ensuring that each student 

them to become confident and successful critical thinkers. The school community supports s
tudents to become 
responsible risk
-
takers and contributing members of society.
 
At Patrick Henry School, we:
 
 

 
create a climate of positive expectations for all
 
 

 
regularly communicate with students and parents
 
 

 
let students know we care
 
 

 
clearly state expectations for appropriate behavior, while providing praise and rewards students exhibiting 
appropriate behaviors and meeting expectations
 
 

 
keep students actively engaged in learning
 
 
Students at Patrick Henry School were productive and suc
cessful throughout the school year in many varied ways. 
Student growth and achievement was evident through the variety of awards students received from their teachers 
throughout the entire year, based on academic gains and good citizenship. Students were p
rovided opportunities for 
involvement in school leadership, such as Peer Assisted Leadership (PAL). During the school day, students at Henry 
benefited from enrichment opportunities, intervention programs, and differentiated instructional settings. Students
 
were provided enrichment opportunities via field trips and assemblies. Patrick Henry School has two part
-
time music 
teachers on staff. Our students in grades TK
-
4th receive music instruction two times per week in general music, while, 
our students in grad
es 5th and 6th grade participate in instrumental music twice a week. Patrick Henry School also 
participates in the Class Act Program through a partnership with the Pacific Symphony of Orange County.
 
 
This 
partnership provides students with music lessons fr
om Symphony musicians as they study the composer of the year. 
Also through Class Act, students participate in interactive musical experiences and attend a youth concert, while our 
families are invited to a family music night with Symphony musicians perform
ing.

District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all sites.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order proce
ss is used to ensure timely and efficient

once every week. No emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Most recent review date: 12/04/2018
 
Annually, Patrick Henry School reviews and updates its comprehensive School Safety Plan, and, after our School Site 

Plan to the Board of 
Education for their approval. Each month, Patrick Henry School holds a fire drill and quarterly, we 
practice earthquake drills. We also practice lockdown drills.
 
 
The School Safety Plan addresses two critical components: (1) People and Programs which inclu
des the school climate 
and (2) Physical Environment. The students, staff, and community work together to create a sense of safety within the 
school. To support this endeavor, we have a schoolwide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system t
o 

comprehensive disaster plan, annual district
-
wide evacuation drill, and regular practice of fire and earthquake drills 
ensure the physical safety of
 
students on campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
 
The school safety plan is a public document and will be readily available for inspection at the school site and at the 
district office.

coaching framework and maximize individual
ized professional learning for teachers through lesson studies, co
-
