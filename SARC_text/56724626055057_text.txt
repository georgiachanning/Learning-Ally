By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Profile:  Fred L. Williams Elementary School is a neighborhood school that ha
s been a part of the Hueneme 
Elementary School District since September 11,1967.  We recently celebrated our 50th Anniversary.  As of December 2019, 
our diverse student population is composed of approximately 640 students. We qualify for Title I funding th
rough the 
Consolidated Application with a socio
-
economically disadvantaged (SED) percentage of 87.3% (based on 2018
-
19 CDE Data 
Quest information). Based on the number of students who qualified to participate in our free and reduced lunch program, 
we quali
fy under Provision 2 which allows for 100% free and reduced lunch eligibility.   Our student demographics include 
the following for the 2018
-
19 school year: 84% Hispanic or Latino, 8% Filipino, 1% African American, 2% White and 5% 
Mixed Race.  We have appr
oximately 53% English Learners, and 14% who were Reclassified as Fluent English Proficient.  
We are less than 1% Migrant & Title III Eligible Immigrants, about 9% Special Ed and approximately 4% Gifted and Talented. 
Our teachers are all highly qualified an
d we are fortunate to have two additional support teachers. Our English Language 
Learner Support Teacher serves our English learner students and teachers. Our Academic Intervention Teacher supports 
struggling readers in the primary grades (her main focus i
s 1st grade). We also have a full
-
time counselor to support 
students with their social
-
emotional and academic needs.  Our school nurse is shared with other schools but we have a 
Health Clerk who supports students daily for 3.5 hours during our peak hours a
round mid
-
day. Our administrators include 
the school principal and assistant principal, who takes on a lot of the disciplinary and behavior management which allows 
the school principal to spend 50% of the time in classrooms.
 
 
All of our Hueneme School Dist
rict schools embrace the vision of  "Inspiring and empowering all students to thrive every 
day."  The mission statement for our Williams wildcats is "We Intend to be Lifelong Learners Inspiring Achieving and 
Modeling Success." (WILLIAMS)  Our motto for suc
cess is  "Expect the Best!  Achieve Success!"  Prior to the launch of the 
school year, our collaborative leadership team met to discuss our focus on school connectedness, parent engagement and 
school culture.  Based on the results of the California Health 
Kids Survey, improving school connectedness was a high area 
of need for our school.  In order to improve in the area of school connectedness and as part of our focus to further support 
students with their social
-
emotional well being, we divided our efforts
 
into student school connectedness, parent 
engagement and school culture. Student school connectedness is being addressed through Student Council, our Second 
Step social
-
emotional curriculum across the grade levels, Circle of Friends social skills group, s
chool assemblies focused 
on connecting with school and each other, and additional opportunities such as our student video bulletin which allows 
for students to have their voices heard. We have created more opportunities for our parents to become involved t
hrough 
our Cafecito con las Directoras meetings, parent surveys, successful PTA membership campaign, an increase in the 
opportunities for parents to become involved in school events and improved public relations with our school community. 
Finally, we've cr
eated opportunities to work on improving our school culture as we collaborate with our staff groups, 
parent groups and student groups.

We have reflected, discussed and planned program goals to address our academic needs as well. Reading continues to be 
an
 
area of need for our students. Our CAASPP results and updated CA Dashboard data have been shared with our 
stakeholders.  In order to improve in the area of reading, an AR committee was formed to overhaul our Accelerated Reader 
(AR) program. The Transition
al Kindergarten (TK) program has offered an extended day schedule which has benefited 
students greatly. All of our extended day kindergarten classes are offering after school reading intervention classes to 
their struggling students. First graders are rece
iving support from our Academic Intervention Teacher who is working with 
small reading groups during the instructional day. Grade levels are being trained every year on Daily 5/CAFE reading 
management systems and strategies. Our after school Fountas & Pinn
ell reading intervention groups are supporting 
struggling second grade readers. During the 2019
-
20 school year, a half
-
time Reading intervention teacher was added to 
support struggling third grade readers during the instructional day.  We are motivated to 
work with all of our Williams 
partners and look forward to new ways to supplement our reading curriculum with fresh ideas to support all readers.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
Williams School underwent landscaping and remodeling projects during the summer of 2019.  The landscaping 
surrounding the office and cafeteria was addressed through the collaboration of our grounds team and our assistant 
principal. The focus was on improving the curb appeal and making our campus more welcoming to our community. In 
addition, our PTA also donate
d items to improve our blacktop and reading garden areas.  We continue to work with our 
custodian team to maintain our facilities to a high standard. We have found the support of our half
-
time night custodian 
very beneficial in maintaining the upkeep of ou
r classrooms and school campus.  A custodian is available for emergency 
repairs and clean
-
up during the day and after school. Although our buildings are about 50 years old, their appearance is 
clean, neat and orderly. Every effort is made to remove graffit
i and make repairs as they come up. Our school is inspected 
regularly for safety hazards and cleanliness. Together, school and district personnel work to ensure that our facilities are 
maintained in a manner that assures function, cleanliness and safety.  
Our most recent FIT report indicated only minor 
repairs, all of which were addressed and taken care of by our maintenance department.
 
 
Williams School is a closed campus.  The safety and welfare of students is a primary focus.  Parents and visitors sign in
 
at 
the office and are given an identification lanyard to wear while they are visiting our campus. Gates are secured around 
the school perimeter during the school day to limit unauthorized access. The security of our front entrance has been 
addressed throu
gh the installation of a controlled entry gate that ensures that all foot traffic must filter through the front 
office. This security project was completed in the summer of 2019.  A locked gate around the kindergarten area helps 
ensure a safe environment e
ven though they are offset from the main campus.  Students are supervised before school, 
during recess, lunch and after school by campus assistants and supported by school administrators.  Great care is taken in 
the release of students who are picked up ea
rly. Procedures are set to only allow adults authorized in writing by the parent 
or guardian. Kindergarten has a daily sign
-
in and sign
-
out procedure in place. Regular fire and earthquake drills are 
conducted. Lock
-
down drills are coordinated with the Oxna
rd Police Department each trimester. Active shooter trainings 
are scheduled for staff annually as well.  Our telephone systems have been upgraded to a VoIP network based system. 
Although each classroom has a telephone, phone calls and interruptions during 
instruction are limited to the windows of 
time near our transition times. Parents who drop off items of clothing, lunches and homework are assisted at the front 
office. Students are expected to check for their belongings during recess or at lunch. In order
 
to improve safety and 
communication, we have equipped our grade level TK
-
third grade teams with school radios.  Our plan is to equip our 
fourth and fifth grade teams by the end of 2020.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil
 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California
 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate ach
ievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entran
ce to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated 
in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

The emphasis is to provide a safe learning environment for students and staff at Williams Elementary School. To help 
achieve the goals of our School Safety Plan, Williams is utilizing the updated Seco
nd Step curriculum designed to teach 
students decision
-
making skills and to reinforce positive social interactions in grades kindergarten through fifth grade. The 
updated program is being implemented school
-
wide with school counselor assistance and modelin
g provided, as needed. 
This year, we continue employing our Character Counts program through which our students are guided toward the six 
pillars of good character which focus on the traits of trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and 
citizenship (TRRFCC).  We focus on a new trait each month coordinates with a specific color that is associated with spirit 
Fridays.  Refresher CHAMPS courses have been offered to both certificated and classified during the 2019
-
20 school year. 
CHAMPS conti
nues to focus on a proactive and positive approach to classroom management which also helps guide 
students to become better citizens.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated and/or discussed with staff on December 16, 2019. We will be finalizing
 
updates to our School Safety Plan with input from the School Site Council (SSC), Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and 
school teams.  Our plan will be focusing on improved  internal security procedures, student drop
-
off/pick
-
up and safe 
ingress and egress 
for students before and after school. As a result of our California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS) results, 
we are continuously searching for activities and programs to strengthen school connectedness and strengthening 
communication between home and school.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals participate in professional development focused on the California 
Common Core State Standards in order to improve their skills in teaching and assessment of student learning. The 
primary 
focus areas are instruction of grade
-
level content standards, intervention strategies for students who have not mastered 
standards, and assessment of student progress. 
 
 
The primary area of focus for the most recent three
-
year period was:
 

 
English L
anguage Arts
 

 
English Language Development
 

 
Writing
 

 
Mathematics
 

 
C.H.A.M.P.S. Program (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, Successful Students)
 
Professional development is offered during the teaching day, on three student
-
free staff develop
ment days, during 
summer institutes, after school, and on weekends. Substitute teachers are provided and the negotiated hourly rate is 
offered for attendance.
 
 
During the school year, teachers are supported by classroom observations, staff meetings, and gr
ade
-
level/content area 
collaboration. Professional learning agendas are based on student achievement data and teacher input. In 
reading/language arts and mathematics, student performance data is ongoing and evaluated using a common assessment. 
A Student Pr
ogress Report aligned to the California Common Core State Standards is sent to parents at the end of each 
trimester.
