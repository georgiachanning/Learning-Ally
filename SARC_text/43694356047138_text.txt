About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 
2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their o
wn individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the California State 
Content 
Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted accordin
g to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about 
the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board
 
of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting a
ligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Evergreen Elementary School was 
originally constructed in 1955.  School facilities are currently comprised of 19 permanent classrooms, 13 portable 
classrooms, psychologist/speech office, day care room, computer lab, library, cafeteria/multipurpose room, kitchen, staff lou
nge, conference 
room, 
stage, and two playgrounds.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Evergreen Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers.  The district has adop
ted cleaning standards for 
all schools in the district.  Basic cleaning operat
ions are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms.  A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff t
o develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

vy maintenanc
e functions 
occurring during vacation periods.  Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure t
hat school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair.  A work order process is used when issues arise that requ
ire immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state mat
ching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interi
or or exterior painting, and floor systems. I n the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided school districts 
with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs.  In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues
, the Evergreen School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility.  The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities a
re clean, safe and in good repair.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority
: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sma
rter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

The staff values the importance of families and community in the academic, social, and emotional success of our students.  Pa
rents participate in the 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA), the School Site Council (SSC) and the Engl
ish Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC).  Parent volunteers frequently visit 
classrooms, facilitate small groups, help with clerical tasks, assist in the computer lab, or chaperone field trips.  Parents
 
meet on campus to plan and 
prepare community activitie
s and fundraisers.  Our parent
-
led ABC Reader program improves the climate on our campus.
 
 
One of our core values is embracing differences on our campus.  International Day is an annual event that PTA hosts.  This ev
ent encourages family 
involvement, and g
ives students a positive cultural identity.  The PTA recruits volunteers to create a booth that displays information about di
fferent 
countries.  Many booths include a taste of native food and a craft project.  Each student gets a stamp in a passport book. 
Once filled, they receive a small 
prize.  An entertaining World Showcase Talent Show concludes the event.  The show includes cultural dances, music and song.  
Families leave International 
Day with a sense of pride and value as an important member of the Ev
ergreen School family.
 
 
PTA plays a vital role supporting students and staff.  They host a welcome back to school breakfast, and a direct donation dr

work during the school year.  The funds support teacher budgets, technology o
n campus, assemblies, field trips and several other initiatives.  The PTA 
assists with supporting the purchase of library resources.  They also encourage community building through activities such as
