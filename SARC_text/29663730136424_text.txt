By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Arete Charter Academy is located on the campus of Magnolia Intermediate School, which was first opened in 1975 after 
a conversion of a 
technology manufacturing center into a middle school. Additional classrooms, multipurpose technology 
centers, art, science, and other facilities were added from 1979 through 1990. An additional multipurpose room was 
completed in 2001 and three relocatable 
classrooms were added in 2006. The 34
-
acre school site is shared with Cottage 
Hill School. The campus totals 40,000 sq. ft. of educational facilities. School playgrounds were reconstructed in 2007 
through a joint project with the Bear River Recreation and 
Parks District. The facilities are widely used by the recreation 
district during non
-
school hours.
 
 
Magnolia Intermediate School provides a safe, clean environment
 
for all students, staff and public use. All facilities are in 

Office of Public School Construction. The school is also maintained by
 
the standards established by the District Board of 
Trustees.
 
 
The maintenance and custodial staff consist of a full
-
time maintenance worker and 1.5 F.T.E. school custodians. The 
Assistant Director of Maintenance also provides services to the site. The sch
ool is cleaned and maintained on a regular 
basis. Kitchen facilities are subject to inspection by the county health department. No Williams Act complaints regarding 
the condition of the school facilities have been filed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

During the Spring of 2019, Fall of 2019, and Winter of 2019 an invitation was sent to all parents inviting them to the Parent
 
Input Meeting. In March and April, parents and students were pro

Arete created and dispenses a Home School Best Practice Parent Handbook to new families and holds multiple parent 
trainings throughout the year to help prepare parents to better support their students in home school. An online closed 
parent group was 
created for parents to share ideas, problem solve issues, and schedule play dates, etc. Orientations are 
held for enhanced support to promote student attendance and engagement, and increasing parent engagement 
opportunities.
 
 
Parents are invited to monthly
 
field trips, class parties, and three evening family get togethers where students and parents 
can meet each other.  This year we added a Back to School Ice Cream Social that was well received. Three times per year, 
families are invited to participate in L
