By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to the Bennett Valley Union School District! 
 
 
The Bennett Valley Union School District has a long, rich history of excellence in education an
d community involvement. 
The district was born in 1853. Originally it was called the Santa Rosa District and was located near present
-
day Galvin Park. 
It was renamed the "Bennett Valley District" in 1942. The Strawberry District, 1857
-
1952 was the other ne
arby district, 
named for the wild strawberries in the area. The two districts merged in 1952 and became the Bennett Valley Union School 
District. 
 
 

e best of rural 
and suburban settings. Our district serves approximately 1,000 students from pre
-
kindergarten through sixth grade on its 
two campuses. Yulupa School serves our transitional kindergarten (KinderBridge) through third grade students. Strawberr
y 
School serves our fourth through sixth graders. Both schools have on
-
site childcare run by the YMCA. 
 
 
The Bennett Valley site, located on Bennett View Drive, currently houses an integrated preschool program with the general 
education preschool operated 

operated by the Rincon Partnership. Together, the programs provide both general education preschool programs and 
integration opportunities for preschoolers with special n
eeds, as well as on site Speech, adaptive physical education, 
nursing, and preschool special day classes will provide a wide range of preschool services through our partnership with 
Rincon Valley and the 4C's. The 4C's also offers preschool childcare.
 
 
The
 
Bennett Valley Union School District is one of the top
-
performing districts in the Sonoma County. Both schools have 
earned Distinguished School Status by the State of California. Strawberry was named a Gold Ribbon School under the 
State's program. Neverth
eless, our work in the district is never done. We are committed to making continuous 
improvement in our curriculum and programs. 
 
 
During my 28 years working for the Bennett Valley Union School District, first as Principal of Strawberry Elementary School

times and challenging budgets. In my opinion, there are three keys to what makes our district successful. 
 
 
The first key is the consistency t
hroughout our district and throughout the years: top
-
notch teachers, innovative programs, 
intentional and focused staff training, high curriculum standards, and consistent leadership. Our academic curriculum 
encourages students to learn, reinforce, and app
ly their learning throughout the core subjects. Our academic support 
programs provide a carefully woven and deliberately planned fabric of support designed to challenge and meet the needs 
of all students at all academic levels. Both schools have fully
-
staf
fed technology labs and multi
-
media learning 
center/libraries, each with extensive collections of over 15,000 titles appropriate to the students in the grade levels serve
d. 
Several remedial and enrichment opportunities exist on both campuses.

and support staff are unbelievable. In addition to being enthusiastic about children and learning, they work extremely well 
together as 
a team making important decisions about allocation of resources, and are committed to ensuring that the 
district mission and vision are realized
--
to nurture all students to achieve to the fullest measure of their potential! Our 
staff is relentless in its w
ork to ensure the success of each student. Their excellence never rests nor diminishes! 
 
 
The third key is partnership. Extensive collaboration prevails district
-
wide. We have a joint School Site Council with faculty, 
staff, and parent members from both sc
hools; and two district
-
wide 501 (c) 3 non
-
profit parent organizations

the 
Bennett Valley Alliance of Parents and Teachers (BVAPT) and the Bennett Valley Education Foundation (BVEF). 
Volunteerism is encouraged and the support of the community has always be
en strong. Our parents want their children 
to go to school in a safe environment with a comprehensive and enriched academic curriculum where student growth and 
education is nurtured, and they participate fully in the process. Thanks to the Bennett Valley E
ducation Foundation (BVEF), 
our curriculum includes visual and performing arts lessons provided to all classes by both professional artists and trained 
docent parents who volunteer in our Art Docent program. The BVEF provides support for the extracurricula
r band and 
chorus programs as well. The Bennett Valley Alliance of Parents and Teachers (BVAPT) raises needed funds to provide a 
well
-
rounded enriched curriculum to all students which includes assemblies, field trips, technology, and the educational 
materi
als needed to bring the curriculum to life. 
 
 
The Bennett Valley Union School District is a wonderful place for the entire school community 
-
 
especially children!
 
 
In this document, we are pleased to offer you comprehensive information about our programs, 
human resources, facilities, 
and budget. The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) is a reporting document required under the Proposition 98 
Educational Accountability System signed into law in 1998 to allow parents, the Department of Education, and tax
payers 
to compare an annual snapshot of schools. This edition reports on the 2017
-
18 school year. The information in this report, 
combined with other required reports described below, offers a comprehensive look at our schools and programs:
 
 
The 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement is a planning document required by the State which includes school goals, 
activities, and expenditures for improving academic performance of students to the proficient level and above, delineating 
actions and categorical funding r
equired for program implementation. This document includes the budget, student 

School Plan
 
for Student 

y, we combine our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement 

plan to describe the actions they will take to ensure that they meet federally req
uired performance goals.
 
 
Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP): The LCAP was first required in 2014 to detail how districts will use the funding 
provided in the state's new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) to address the state's 8 priority areas: B
asic Services, 
Student Achievement, School Climate, Student Engagement, Implementation of Common Core Standards, Parent 
Involvement, Course Access, and Other Student Outcomes. The LCAP is available on our website: www.bvusd.org.
 
 
All three of these documents are available to parents and community members in an attempt to further the partnership 
that makes our schools strong. Please feel free to contact me with any concerns or ideas that will help make the 
educational experience of 
our children the best it can be.

Purpose, Mission and Vision
 
 
The fundamental purpose of the Bennett Valley Union School District is to educate young people with the highest possible 
quality instruction and to nurture stud

highest potential. 
 
 
Mission and Vision: The mission of the Bennett Valley Union School District is to deliver a superior educational experience 
to each child by working rel
entlessly to ensure student mastery in the fundamental skills they will need for their continuing 
education and life. We provide many opportunities for all students to apply and use their knowledge in successful and 
meaningful ways. Within a learning clima
te that encourages innovation and creativity, children are nurtured to learn a 
broad
-
based academic and extended curriculum necessary for their continuing and future success. Our vision is inspired 
by Hodding Carter: We endeavor to give our children roots,
 
the academic foundation, self
-
concept, and positive attitude 
upon which success in school depends. At the same time, we give our students wings

 
the thinking skills, creativity, 
flexibility, enthusiasm and broad world view to soar beyond the commonplace. 
 
 
Our Partnership for Excellence has 4 Perpetual Goals. Annual goals, objectives and action plans are written to address 
specific areas of need within these broader goals: 
 

 
Goal #1: Create and maintain a high performance organization based on mutual respec
t, courtesy and 
professionalism
 

 
Goal #2: Work in partnership to assist each student in making measurable progress each school year
 

 
Goal #3: Maintain fiscal integrity
 

 
Goal #4: Develop and maintain a community outreach program
 
Vision for 
Technology: The Bennett Valley Union School District will provide technological resources and experiences for 
its students, parents, faculty, staff, and administration in preparation for the workplace and life long learning in the 
twenty
-
first century. Our
 
vision is to utilize computers and other educational technology as a natural and integral part of 
learning and teaching, and as a part of student performance data analysis, communication with parents, staff and all 
stakeholders. To that end, each classroo
m is equipped with a digital light projector, digital camera, sound system, teacher 
laptop, wireless teacher microphone, and student computers. The Computer Labs are fully staffed and have full class sets 
of high quality computers for students for their us
e during their weekly curriculum
-
integrated technology lessons and at 
other times during the school week. Both libraries also have computers for book searches, research, Lexia, Read Works, 
Reading Eggress, Zearn and to take Accelerated Reader tests.

-
being of every student 
through a school
-
wide commitment that assures safety, instills respect, and both models and requires responsibility. Ou
r

Strawberry School serves fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students in a safe, respectful, supportive,
 
engaging, purposeful, and 
challenging environment that is conducive to the highest achievement and best learning for our students. Our 
comprehensive curriculum is integrated to allow students to apply and reinforce their learning throughout the core 
subje
cts and beyond. All students are provided a rigorous, standards
-
based academic program in language arts, 
mathematics, science, history/social studies, physical education and visual and performing arts. Strawberry School 
students have the opportunity to par
ticipate in an active Student Council, Technology Club, Science Club, and social 
interaction groups (Book Club and Lunch Bunch with the counselor, counseling interns, or other trained staff) as well as 
academic competitions such the County Spelling Bee (wh
ich students from Strawberry School have recently won twice), 
the National Geographic Geography Bee, and the County Chess Tournament (annually hosted by our school). Other 
opportunities include lunchtime intramural sports programs called "noon league" with
 
basketball, soccer, and softball, an 
interscholastic 4th 
-
 
6th grade volleyball and basketball league for boys and girls (two teams of each for basketball), band, 
chorus, flag and shield team programs, and a rich program in the arts, including dance, musi
c, and visual arts. After
-
school 
program offerings for students include Technology/Computer Coding, Videography, Stop
-
Motion Animation, Science, 
Spanish, Art, Chess, and Drama are offered through youth
-
oriented enrichment groups and individuals.
 
 
Students 
are taught environmental stewardship. They participate in "Walk and Roll to School" days during which they 
learn to be safe while providing self
-
powered transport to and from school on bikes, skateboards, skates, or scooters. Each 
year the fourth and fifth
 
grade classes have instruction on bicycle and pedestrian safety. The fourth graders all have a day 
of hands
-
on training about bicycle safety during a Bicycle Rodeo near the end of the year. The sixth grade participates in 
an intensive hands
-
on study of ea
rly humans and in a four
-
day environmental studies field trip at Walker Creek Ranch in 
Marin County each year. 
 
 
Strawberry School students thrive

achieving personal growth in a safe and supportive atmosphere where their progress 
and success is frequently 
monitored, acknowledged, and celebrated. We measure success through our evaluation of the 
whole child

the academic progress, the growth in responsibility, and the good citizenship that the students learn and 
practice. The State testing program, the SBAC En
glish/Language Arts and Math tests, and teacher
-
 
and publisher developed 
assessments help measure student progress toward state and national targets in English/Language Arts, Math, Science, 
History, and Physical Education. Teachers analyze student performa
nce data from several sources for each of their 
students throughout the school year as well as at the beginning and end of each year to help determine areas in need of 
attention and to design ways to maximize student progress. 
 
 
Students are screened for r
eading fluency and comprehension a minimum of three times per year, and much more 

are provided through a Response to Intervention (Rt
I) program of targeted assistance in reading and through assessment 
and remediation in the classroom in both language arts and mathematics. In addition to measuring their improvement on 
quantifiable objective measures, student progress is measured through 
the use of complex long
-
term projects that require 
a high degree of problem
-
solving, effort, creativity, and scholarship. The staff participates in researching new textbook 
adoptions and works hard to move instruction to Common Core.
 
 
Strawberry School fir

Distinguished School status was again achieved in 2006 and again in 2012. In 2016, Strawberry was awarded the State's 
new Gold Ribbon Award for Excellence, t
he Title 1 Schools Award and the Arts Education Award. Retired principal, Scott 
Humble received the Sonoma County Administrators' Association's: Elementary Principal of the Year/LifeTime 
Achievement Award in 2016. We have maintained the programs and the hi
gh achievement that qualified us for the 
distinguished designation.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
District Facilities:  Yulupa School, our TK
-
3rd 
grade school,  was built in 1976 and dedicated on October 3, 1976. Strawberry 
School, our 4th
-

updated with both long and short
-
range goals resulting
 
in districtwide facilities and grounds that are safe, attractive, and 

make use of the latest educational technology. Solar power throug
hout both schools provides the majority of our 
electricity needs.   Buildings take advantage of the latest advances in energy efficiency in lighting, heating/air conditioni
ng, 
roofs, and meet the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Act mandates. Classroom la
youts facilitate grade
-
level teaming to 
support teaching and learning. The facilities are clean and in good repair.  Adult and student restrooms and all toilets and 
urinals are kept operational.
 
 
The State Williams lawsuit generated additional requirements
 

specific in reporting the condition of their facilities. In the Bennett Valley School District our facilities are in good sha
pe. 
They are well
-
maintained. Repairs are handled in a timely fashio
n. Our Facility Improvement Plan has been almost fully 
implemented with recent renovation, modernization, and maintenance improvement. Our school facilities and 
playgrounds were audited by Redwood Empire Schools Insurance Group (RESIG, our insurance joint 
powers authority) for 
safety during in February of 2018.
 
 
Our District custodial and maintenance staff for 2018
-
19 included four full
-
time custodians, 1 full
-
time landscaper, 1 full 
time assistant landscaper/custodian, and a full
-
time Director of Maintenan
ce and Operations.  Since we have added 
significant square footage to Yulupa's campus, beginning 2014
-
15, we added back the position of Assistant 
Groundskeeper/Custodian that had been cut during the State's fiscal crisis. The custodians empty the trash and
 
vacuum 
classrooms daily and clean the sinks as needed. On a weekly basis, they clean the chalk/white boards. Every summer, the 
carpets are cleaned (new carpets take steam without soap), hard floors are waxed, chairs are power
-
washed, and desks 
are waxed.

temporary/port
able classrooms, construct a new multipurpose room, remodel the former multi
-
use room into a new 
library, remodel the former library into a Learner Center complex, and at both sites, install solar panels and renovate PE 
facilities. In addition, we renovate
d three thirty + year old portables and created a new District Office Complex, moving 
from the aging District Office portable. These projects began during the spring of 2011 and were completed in spring 2013. 
In 2014, the removal of the old District Office
 
portable and expanded parking were completed.  In 2015, the entire roof 
for the kindergarten complex was replaced and repairs were made to the office complex roof.  In 2017, the Prop 39 lighting 
and thermostat projects were completed enhancing the lightin
g and energy efficiency.  Also in 2017, the Bennett Valley 
site, following the departure of Sierra School who had leased part of the facility for 5 years,  was transformed into the 
Bennett Valley Early Childhood Education Center with programs for general a
nd special education preschoolers.  The roof 
over the lower wing was replaced during the summer 2018.  The flat part of the roof over the Strawberry School Library 
and Classroom complex re
-
roofed in summer 2019.  Exterior painting was completed of the modu
lar buildings and 
playground and parking lot lines.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Parental involvement is
 
a hallmark of our district. Parents partner with us to ensure that we are able to deliver the very 
best education possible for all students.  Our comprehensive curriculum includes the visual and performing arts and a 
fitness based physical education progr
am as well as building a solid foundation in the core academic subjects

Language 
Arts, Math, History and the Social Sciences, and Science. Parents volunteer in the classrooms, libraries, and in after school
 
programs, present curriculum
-
integrated art lesso

advisory committees, and provide leadership and membership on School Site Council, the Bennett Valley Alliance of 
Parents and Teachers, Bennett Valley Education Foundation, and on the B
oard of Trustees.
 
 
Board of Trustees: The Board is comprised of five members, each serving a four
-
year term. Members are elected through 
the general election held in November. Candidates must be California citizens, registered voters, and live within distr
ict 
boundaries. Agendas for the monthly meetings are posted at both schools, the District Office, and on the website. The 
main functions of the Board are to employ and evaluate the superintendent, establish district policy and monitor the 
budget; and to se
t and monitor the implementation of annual and long
-
range goals. To learn more, please call the 
superintendent at (707) 542
-

School Site Council: A joint School Site Council comprised of parents, faculty, staff, and principals from both schools 
overs
ees all of the academic support programs, their funding, compliance with federal and state law, and evaluation of 
those programs. Representatives are elected by their peer groups to serve two
-
year staggered terms. The Site Council 
meets one afternoon per m
onth and serves also in a budget advisory capacity to the Board of Trustees and as the LCAP 
planning committee. The Site Council chairperson can be contacted through either school site. The School Site Council 
reviews and analyzes student assessment data, 
receives parent and staff input, and works to determine and to address 
the needs of all students including English learners, educationally disadvantaged students, gifted and talented (GATE) 
students, and students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Committees for Par
ents of Students in Academic Support and Enrichment Programs: The English Language Advisory 
Council (ELAC) is comprised of parents of students in our program for English Learners who meet to review the program, 
the master plan, the budget, and the student 
performance and progress of our English Learners.  There is also a designed 
EL parent member on our school site council. Parents of students in our Title 1 program meet annually to review the 
program and have designated the Site Council to represent their 
interests through a designated Title 1 member on the 
Council.

raises 
needed funds to provide assemblies, field trips, library books, instructional materials as well support for reading, PE, 
science, faculty allowances, and computer technology. BVAPT organizes community events including the Walkathon, 
Gingerbread Hous
e Night, Sock Hop, Kindergarten Picnic and Family Fun nights. When a prominent district parent and 
community leader, Dan Peletz, died in 1994, the Daniel L. Peletz Educational Park Committee was incorporated to turn 
the area surrounding Yulupa School into 
an educational park. Today the park contains several study
-
sized specialty areas 
that mirror the many ecosystems of Sonoma County. Once the park was completed in 2002, the charter was turned over 
to the BVAPT. The BVAPT may be contacted through either scho
ol.
 
 
Bennett Valley Education Foundation (BVEF): BVEF is a private, non
-
profit corporation that generates revenue through 
our Legacy Tile Nights, Valley of the Arts auction (launched in April 2009), and the annual contribution campaign. 
Additionally, BVEF 
funds allow for curriculum
-
integrated art docent lessons provided by trained parent volunteers. The 
Foundation funds a portion of the cost of our Band and Chorus programs at Strawberry School along with the parents of 
the musicians. BVEF members can be con
tacted through the District Office. You can get involved in any of our volunteer 
organizations by calling the contact person listed, the superintendent, or either of the school principals.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Safety Plan (2018
-
19):  The Comprehensive School 
Safety Plan and the Emergency Preparedness plans are updated 
annually. Before school begins each year, all district employees receive training and copies of the plans. Our 
comprehensive training includes CPR and First Aid
--
including training int analphylax
is and diabetes, Blood
-
borne 
Pathogens, Safety in the Workplace, Sexual Harassment and Abuse Prevention, Bullying and Cyberbullying prevention, 
Integrated Pest Management, Active Shooter Response, Emergency Management System
--
the National Incident 
Manageme
nt System (NIMS) and the State Emergency Management System (SEMS).  In addition, yard duty supervisors 
complete two yard supervision modules, custodians complete playground safety, maintenance modules.  Lunch workers 
complete food safety modules, and sever
al classifications of employees complete back safety training.  All employees also 
do the CA Department of Education's Child Abuse Prevention and Reporting module for annual certification.
 
 
Our Emergency/Disaster Preparedness plan is updated 
annually and is compliant with both state and federal requirements 
and includes disaster preparedness, emergency protocols (per NIMS and SEMS), the comprehensive school safety plan 
[required by Title IV] and a host of policies and procedures designed to ke
ep our schools, students and staff safe.
 
 
The fully updated Comprehensive School Safety Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan was reviewed and approved by 
the Site Council was reviewed and approved by Site Council in September 2018 and by the Board of Trust
ees in October 
2018.   New legislation that took effect January 2019 required some additional sections to the plan.  The plan was then 
updated and reviewed and approved by Site Council, the Board of Trustees, and the police department in March 2019.  
The p
lan was updated during the summer 2019 and is being reviewed for compliance.  After the review, it will go to Site 
Council, the Board, and the Police for approval.
 
 
There are annual incidents of vandalism and graffiti, and occasional incidents of theft. Th
e Leadership Team analyzes these 
incidents and implements plans to make the schools safer. In 2014, security cameras were added to both schools to protect 
the solar arrays and enhance school safety.  A new emergency text notification system was activated i
n December 2014 
that was used extensively during the 2017 fires.  We have continued to make improvements to both systems.
 
 
In October 2018, an active shooter training and drill was done with school personnel and first responders.  The 
communication system 
was drilled (all three elements), training was provided in run, hide, fight, stop the bleed and use 
of a fire extinguisher for putting out fires and to be used as a weapon against an active shooter.  This training was updated
 
in August 2019.

Our dedicated instructional faculty and staff are committed to nurturing the 
achievement of each child to their level of 
personal best.   None of the schools in the district have ever been in "program improvement" status.
 
 
As a result of the  State funding formula, entitled the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), the district no 
longer receives 

cost reimbursement, one time funding  to continue to develop, implement, and fund programs to meet the needs of 
students as
 
determined using the results of multiple assessments of student progress and staff and parent input.
 
 
Our 2017
-
18 LCAP focused our work on two key goals and related actions and services. They are our continuing goals.
 
 
LCAP Goal #1: Academic Success: We s

Programs
 
Over the years we have developed a deliberate, tightly woven fabric of comprehensive support for all students via our 
classroom and special supp
ort programs. The programs are evaluated at least annually to ensure that they continue to 
work together, build upon each other, and offer developmentally appropriate, programmatic continuity for students. Our 
goal is for all students to achieve the fulles
t measure of their potential in reading, writing, and math, to improve annually, 
and to meet State and district performance targets:
 

n 
at the fifth grade.)
 
2. On
-
going assessments conducted throughout the year: DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic English Literacy Skills), Star 
Reading, Star Math, and Benchmark Writing Assessments.
 


 
 
Special Education: The purpose of Special Education programs is to provide a free and appropriate public education that 
meets the needs of Special Education
-
eligible students as indicated on the
ir Individualized Education Plan, and to assist 
each child in achieving to the fullest measure of his/her potential in the Least Restrictive Environment appropriate. 
Students are eligible for special education when a significant discrepancy exists between 
the cognitive ability and 
achievement, and they have a learning or other disability impeding their ability to reach potential. The regular classroom 
teachers and those providing special services (school psychologist, school nurse, speech and language clini
cian, Resources 

Yulupa has one Special Education teacher, one intern special ed teacher (part time) with two instructional 
paraprofe
ssionals. Strawberry has 2 Special Education teachers and one intern special ed teacher (part time), each with 
the equivalent of a full day paraprofessional provided by three paraprofessionals. The services of the other specialists are 
shared based on need
.
 
 
English Learners: All Bennett Valley teachers have specialty credentials authorizing them to teach English learners in their 
classes. They provide at least 30 minutes per day of "English Language Development" that can be integrated into the 
classroom cu
rriculum or done in special groupings with EL students. In addition, both schools have specially trained EL 
paraprofessionals who work with student either in a "push in" or "pull out" manner to give them "pre
-
teaching" pre
-
class 
exposure to a lesson or cla
ssroom reading, then support with the companion work, and post teaching to ensure mastery 
in addition to explicit English Language Development.

Response to Intervention and the iTeam: In 2007
-
08, the district began DIBELs assessments to pinpoint areas of 
need in 
remediation. We have since added Star Reading, Star Math, and Benchmark Writing Assessments. The results are used to 
provide specific and targeted instruction designed to remediate deficits of those not achieving proficiency and enhance 
instruction
 
for those achieving at or above grade level expectations on State standards in Reading. Each grade level has 
tailored the invention to the need, employing a variety of strategies to meet the needs of all students including flexible 
grouping, personalized 
instruction via various computer programs including Lexia, Khan Academy, and many others.   
Struggling students receive special instruction in decoding, phonics, blends, fluency, comprehension, etc. Those students 
who have mastered standards are participat
ing in extension activities such as higher leveled readers, literature circles, 
etc. All students are assessed three to four times per year and as determined by grade level teams, may be placed in 


diagnosed needs of each child. This district
-
wide approach has replaced the after
-
school targeted instructional programs. 
Rather than the thirteen students per grade level (the maximum number that the af
ter school program could 
accommodate) each child is receiving instruction at his/ her level and is able to move up through the levels as he/she 
progresses in the mastery of standards!   Those struggling to attain reading fluency or falling below grade leve
l may also 
be served by our iTeam (credentialed teachers and paraprofessionals specially trained to provided targeted instruction to 
students) during the Power Half Hours designated for their grade levels.
 
 
Accelerated Reading: Accelerated Reader, in 

reading levels and prescribes books for them to read at their particular level.  A great many of books in the school library 
are coded by reading levels.  After reading a book, studen
ts take a test on the computer to assess their understanding of 
the book they have read.
 
 
Writing:  Students are taught to write in a variety of genres and with 7 traits:  Ideas, Organization, Voice, Word Choice, 
Sentence Fluency, Conventions, and Presenta
tion; with a comprehensive assessment matrix that challenges students at 
all levels to improve.   Benchmark assessments given three times per year gauge student progress in writing.
 
 
Science:  In the summer for 2015, a classroom at each school was remodele
d into a science lab.  Starting in 2015
-
16, 
science specialists provide one, ten
-
week unit in one of the core areas of Next Generation Science Standards in addition 
to the science provided by teachers.
 
 
Projects:  Our teachers work very hard to ensure that
 
class projects have application and challenge for students with a 
wide range of abilities.  All students are expected to work to their potential on class projects.
 
 
High Expectations:  All of our students are expected to apply themselves and to work to th
eir potential.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE
--
4th 
-
6th grades): Our GATE program incorporates differentiated instruction and 
acceleration as appropriate in the regular class, as well as optional after
-
school enrichment classes. The optional after
-
sc
hool classes offer students opportunities to work with other GATE students on topics of interest (Science, Art, Computer 
Technology, Animation, Robotics, Sewing). Parents of GATE students and their teachers create a Gifted Learning Plan for 
each GATE
-
ident
ified student annually. Students are eligible for GATE by their achievement on the Structure of the 
Intellect (SOI) Test per SOI requirements. Those who are close to meeting SOI standards are eligible if they meet 3 
additional criteria including superior a
chievement on state tests and district assessments, teacher recommendation, and 

classroom.  Students do not have to be GATE
-
eligible to
 
have their needs met through differentiated instruction.  Teachers 
receive high
-
quality professional development training in differentiating the curriculum to meet the needs of all students.

Academic Enrichment Programs
--
 
Libraries: Both schools have Mul
ti
-
Media Learning Centers (MMLC), also referred to as libraries. Each contains a collection 
of over 15,000 items including books, videos, magazines, CDs, models, and other multi
-
media teaching materials. The 
collection covers the curriculum as appropriate 
for the grade levels served at the school. The library collection catalog is 
fully automated and can be accessed via the Internet and from every computer in the district and outside the district. 
There are two student computer terminals in each library tha
t offer the automated card catalogue, Internet access, and 
word
-
processing capabilities. The expanded library and the computer lab share a building complex that allows integration 
of both programs. Each class has a weekly session in the library. The librar
y program consists of reading stories related to 
the curriculum or featured authors, library skills lessons, and discussion of holiday celebrations and seasonal events such 
as Columbus Day, Arbor Day, African
-
American History and Women's History Months, Ea
rth Day, Constitution Day, 

staffed by a multi
-
media specialist for six hours per day.
 
 

 
technology plan includes a specific emphasis on supporting reading 
instruction, including the use of Accelerated Reader in grades 1
-
6 and LEXIA in K
-
6, and the Follett library system in both 
school libraries. While technology cannot replace a skilled teac
her, the effective use of well
-
designed technology
-
based 
supports can provide additional resources for students, especially those potentially at
-
risk for reading failure. Currently, 
the district uses technology to: match student reading levels and text dif
ficulty for supplemental reading using Accelerated 
Reader; provide assessments to monitor student progress; provide additional differentiated practice in skills, strategies, 
etc.; provide access to informational and research sources/websites for teacher an
d students; and enhance 
communication and promote the sharing of data, problem
-
solving, etc. among district professionals and parents. First 
through sixth grade classes visit the computer lab weekly. The curriculum involves appropriate training so that stu
dents 
learn to use technology as a tool for research, writing, assessment, academic skills development and practice, 
communication, etc. All students have access to computer technology and filtered Internet from each classroom, library, 
and computer lab. I
n 2004
-
05, the Tech Committee, comprised of employees and parents from both sites, updated the 
Technology plan and resubmitted it to the State and was updated in 2015.   Each teacher was required to take an on
-
line 
technology assessment to determine staff 
development needs, and an updated staff development component was 
developed that endeavors to provide teachers with the training needed to integrate technology as appropriate in the 
curriculum and use technology to increase efficiency. In August 2005, each
 
teacher was given a lap top computer from 
our APT and we began the migration from Mac to PC. Both schools have recently acquired wireless Internet. Both labs 
have virtual field trip and video conferencing capability. Our technology plan also includes the 
use of technology to 
increase district efficiency in attendance accounting, business services, record keeping, communication, library services, 

rint.
 
 
Classroom Technology:  All classrooms have data projectors with a document camera, iPad, and Apple TV and a designated 
instructional computer for instruction.  In addition, all classrooms have a teacher's computer,  classroom computers, and 
other te
chnology such as tablets as appropriate to the grade level.  There are several "mobile scholars labs" at each school 
that have class sets of computers and are shared by the classrooms.
 
 
Visual and Performing Arts:  Thanks to the fundraising done by the Ben
nett Valley Education Foundation, all classes receive 
units of study in both the visual and performing arts by actual artists.  In addition, we have a band and chorus program at 
Strawberry.
 
 
Parent Education:  A Parent Education Seminar series is offered i


 
 
Counseling: An increase in counseling services from a half to a full time counselor was first 
implemented in 2014.  This, 
coupled with the services of our counseling interns (when available), has enabled us to offer more needed services to 
students in the form of individual and small group counseling on a host of topics including friendship, divorc
e, grief, better 
school performance, etc.

Ongoing professional development of the school staff is an important part of improving the school program. 
Professional 
development is linked to employee personal professional goals, school wide goals, and district goals. All teachers 
participate in professional development programs during each school year. Teachers work a 186 day calendar with 180 
days for stu
dent instruction and six professional development days. Many of our teachers have Masters Degrees. One of 
our teachers is earning her National Board Certification. Our school counselor received her National Board Certification 
several years ago. All of our
 
teachers have received special certification to teach English learners. New teachers are 
supported through the assignment of a district mentor teacher and participation in the North Coast School of Education 
Teacher Induction Program. In addition to the d
istrict
-
provided training, teachers go to workshops and classes provided 
by the County Office of Education, colleges and universities, etc. Instructional staff members have the opportunity and 
are encouraged to go to district, union, county or university p
rovided training.
 
 
The purpose of staff development is to increase the skills and knowledge of every staff member to enable them to teach 

based 
on these four tenets, and must:
 

 
Be ongoing, flexible, staff
-
designed, and research
-
based
 

 
Result in the design and application of effective problem
-
solving and organizational practices
 

 
Provide an opportunity for staff to pursue, develop, implement, an
d evaluate curricular and instructional 
advancements
 

 
Enhance the capacity of the staff to work cooperatively, and to develop exemplary professional relationships at 
school and district levels
 
Each year all staff members are trained in emergency preparednes
s and basic first aid. Every couple of years, the district 
provides certification training for CPR and First Aid for all employees.
 
 
Focus Areas Since Common Core Standards were Approved for California:
 
 
2012
-
13 professional development included common cor
e and 21st century skills awareness
 
 
2013
-
14 professional development included 21st century skills implementation and math common core transition.
 
 
2014
-
15 professional development included additional depth in common core math and 21st century 
skills. Math Solutions 
conducted a four part professional development series with all teachers. Addition training in 21st century skills was also 
presented throughout the year.
 
 
2015
-
16: Eureka Math Implementation training started the school year. In Janua
ry through March, 2016, West Ed 
conducted a training series and lesson study with all teachers on English Language Arts common core and on the English 
Language Arts/English Language Development Framework. In addition, all teachers participated in a Next Ge
neration 
Science Standards (NGSS) introductory training given by West Ed. We began the NGSS science series
--
actual scientists 
teach a lesson series to each class
--
the series offers hands on instruction in science to students and provides NGSS 
modeling to t
