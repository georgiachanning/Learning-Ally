By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cherrywood Elementary School is part of the Berryessa Union
 
School District and is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, 
nestled against the northeast foothills of San Jose, California.  Cherrywood is centrally located within the district's borde
rs. 
It made its debut in a shopping center variety store, and in it
s early days was sometimes referred to as the "Ben Franklin 
Store School." The Berryessa Union School District grew at a rapid pace during the 1970's. During the accelerated growth 
period, two district schools were temporarily housed in this Ben Franklin S
tore. The current school site was officially 
opened and dedicated in August 1974. This school's main building has 18 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a 
library, cafeteria, a kid's kitchen, a loft area, and an administration building. In addition to
 
the main building, there are 
eight portable classrooms, and a daycare center that have been added to accommodate class size reduction. Currently, 
the school serves about 340 students in SpEd Preschool and grades Kindergarten through fifth grade on a tradi
tional 
calendar schedule. This year, with the launch of the district's very first Mandarin dual immersion program, two 
kindergarten Mandarin immersion classes and one first grade Mandarin immersion class was added to the school.  The 
school provides a fami
ly
-
oriented, nurturing, and safe place for students to learn, grow, and develop intellectually. 
Teachers, staff, and administrators make it a priority to develop a student
-
centered school community where learning for 
a lifetime happens!
 
 
Our mission is tha
t Cherrywood students will develop their love of learning, social/emotional skills, and a sense of their 
global and community responsibilities while meeting or exceeding grade level academic standards.  Cherrywood 
Elementary will be recognized for educatio
nal excellence in a safe, innovative and inclusive student
-
centered learning 
environment, inspiring students, staff and the community.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a
 
strong emphasis on ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) dev
eloped by the State of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition 
of the school facilities and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the conditio
n of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Cherrywood was opened in 1974. This school has 23 regular classrooms, a multipurpose room, a 
library, and an administration building. In addition to the main building, there are eight portable classrooms that have 
been added to accommodate class size reduction and instructional programs for the Santa Clara County Office of 
Education. Before and Af
ter School Daycare services are also available on campus.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system proce
ss is used to ensure efficient service and 

in good working order. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed
 
through the Energy 
Conservation Assistance Act in identified areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedul
es is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenance supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and camp
us grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.
 
 
Modernization Projects: During the 2018/2019 school year and 2019 summer period local bond funds (Measure L) were 
used for the construction of a Flexible Instructional Space and repairs to exterior sid
ing of building. Work described will 
be completed by the start of the 19/20 school year.

opportunities to be involved at the site. Parent involvement is a district and site priority. The 
School Site Council (SSC), under the leadership of the principal, serves as a team through which the school improvement 
process moves forward. The team, which
 
is comprised of parents, community members, staff members and the site 
principal, work collaboratively to develop a school plan that has measurable objectives.
 
 
These objectives are based on the school budget and seek to improve the needs of the total scho
ol population.
 
 
The SSC oversees, monitors, and reviews the site plan. The team also approves any revisions to the plan when necessary. 
Ultimately, the SSC recommends our plan to the Berryessa Union School District Board for approval.  The English Learner 
Advisory Committee (ELAC) is comprised of school staff and members of the parent community. The ELAC committee 
helps develop and implement the plan for English Learners. With information from the principal, the committee learns 
about the needs of English l
earners in our school and ensures the EL Master Plan addresses those needs.
 
 
The school also has at least one representative who participates at the district level in DELAC, the District English Learner
 
Advisory committee.  There, the 
representative has the opportunity to have his/her voice heard regarding effectiveness 
of the program, questions about implementation across the district, testing requirements, or any concerns or questions 
parents may have. With the launch of our Mandarin 
dual immersion program, we have a Mandarin Immersion Parent 
Advisory Committee (MIPAC) so parents can meet monthly to give their input about the program and help develop the 
master plan for our program. They also help sponsor our schoolwide Lunar New Year 
celebration. Our Home and School 
Club which has a parent elected board, sponsors monthly family nights for Cherrywood families such as Family Movie 
Night, Family Reading Night, Family Dance Night, and Family Holiday Craft Night.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 
school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as
 
well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.
 
 
At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of professional 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers r
eceived training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to their needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instruc
tional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they teach, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recent
ly adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

h their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional needs.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up 
to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days for each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-
2 days for trai

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia curriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.

Throug
hout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year
 
in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elementary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, 
Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning.  Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three
 
days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  Teachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four in
structional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to teachers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to 
an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated Assistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
b
y WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly professional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the di
strict goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
