School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Students who arrive on the bus before 8:15 are supervised by a yard duty. Students are expected to arrive no 
earlier than 
8:15, unless they are in a tutoring class. All gates to campus open at 8:15, when yard duty staff begins.  A well trained 
Safety Patrol member escorts students across a busy intersection at the front of the school and is monitored by an adult.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:
 
This school has classrooms, a cafeteria, librar
y, and an administration office. The main campus was built in 1949 and 
opened in 1949.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely mann
er. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The Operations Department has adopted cleaning standards for all 
schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
are available at the school office, or at the Maintenance & Operations office. The Maintenance & Operations Department 
works continuously with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure
 
a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance:
 
The District participated in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provided flexible state matching funds 
to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existi
ng school facilities components. State 
contributions to this Program ended in the 2012
-
13 school year. Deferred Maintenance typically includes paving, roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor
 
systems. Carry
-
over funds for 
deferred maintenance projects throughout the District in Funds 01 and 14 have been exhausted. The Board has authorized 
the General Fund to annually contribute $2 million to Facility Maintenance to be used for new construction
 
and 
maintenance projects throughout the District, $2 million to Deferred Maintenance for maintenance projects throughout 

against al
l other District site repairs and the most urgent repairs are addressed first..
 
 
Data provided by LEA. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking 
with the school principal.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which

through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
