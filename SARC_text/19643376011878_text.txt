By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Walt Disney Elementary School (WDE)  is a school located in
 
a suburban community adjacent to the city of Los Angeles.  
The school was established in 1946 after World War II when the city experienced substantial growth like many other 
southern California bedroom communities at that time (Clark & McDaniel, 2013) and
 
was referred to as Central Avenue 
School. In 1969, the school was renamed as Walt Disney Elementary School. At this time the school boasts a student 
population of 437 students in kindergarten through fifth grade based on district data.  In 2013, the schoo
l launched the 
Spanish/English Dual Immersion program in Kindergarten. Currently, it has a Dual Immersion classroom in grades 
kindergarten through fifth grade. The student population at Walt Disney Elementary School is rich with diversity and we 
take pride
 
in recognizing and celebrating our differences with events such as Multicultural Night and the Dia De Los 
Muertos Ball. We also actively seek input by all stakeholders within our diverse community. We believe these varied 
interests and cultures  provide d
eep learning opportunities for our school's instructional practices and provide a stepping 
stone for our students to acquire and master 21st century skills.  Disney was recognized as a Gold Ribbon Award School in 
2016 and as a California Distinguished Scho
ol in 2009, 2018 and 2020.
 
 
The Walt Disney Elementary School's mission is to provide ALL students with a positive and challenging learning 
environment, which empowers them to become responsible, caring and productive citizens of the world.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T
he percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prio
rity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Parents play a vital 

teacher, and their input is invaluable. There are a variety of opportunities to get involved at WDE, which include but are 
not limited to the following:
 
 
SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL (SSC)
 
Parents and teachers work together on the SSC committee to continually improve our school plan and programs by 
analyzing student data, parent input and school needs. The 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, written by the 
committ
ee, is the guiding document behind the programs, curriculum application, and categorical budgeting processes.  
Parents serve on this advisory council along with teachers and other school staff. The SSC meets at least four times a year 
with the meetings ope
n to the public.
 
 
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (ELAC)
 
ELAC is a committee made up parents of our English language learners.  The purpose of this committee is to provide 
opportunities for parents of second language learners to give input 
regarding curriculum and instructional practices as 
well as our school environment. This important group provides input on academic, budgeting and intervention suggestions 
and ideas for topics of interest to be included in meetings. This group meets a mini
mum of four times a year and is 
conducted in Spanish and English. The president of our ELAC also represents our voice on the District English Language 
Advisory Committee.
 
 
PARENT TEACHER ASSOCIATION (PTA)
 
The PTA is vital to the school community, especiall
y the students at Disney.  This active parent group plans and provides 
events throughout the year that develop the whole child and enrich the students' educational experience. The PTA raises 
money to fund enrichment activities, instructional materials, and
 

opportunities.  Over the years, hard working parents have dedicated their time and talents to support the PTA program. 
Meetings are held on the second Thursday of the month.
 
 
DUAL IMMERSION PARENT COMMITTEE 
(DI PAC)
 
The Dual Immersion Parent Committee meets four times annually to discuss celebrations and challenges of having a 
student enrolled in the DI program. The meeting is open to parents from both elementary sites that currently offer a DI 
Spanish progra
ms: Walt Disney and William McKinley.
 
 
GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION  PARENT COMMITTEE (GATE PAC)
 
This groups meets once annually at the school site and bi
-
monthly at the District level. The group offers an opportunity to 
provide parent education with havi
ng a GATE student and to discuss student opportunities.
 
 
Parents have many opportunities to be involved at Disney. Examples of some of the opportunities at Disney include the 
groups mentioned above.  While small in number, the group is enthusiastic and eag
er to add their efforts to enrich 
programs here at Disney. We have a large pool of parent volunteers who come and work in our classes. Some parents 
work in classrooms on a regular basis; others volunteer their time on an occasional basis. Either way, their
 
contributions 
are greatly appreciated. Throughout the year, parents also participate in different functions such as,Welcome Back Picnic,  
Multicultural Night, Halloween Parade, Dia de los Muertos Ball, Spring Dance, Doughnuts and Dads, Moms and Muffins, 
S
am and Me Dance, Mother
-
Son Game Night, Science Family Night, Science Fair Award Night, Mindfulness Family Night, 
monthly school wide assemblies, holiday grams and Visual Arts .
