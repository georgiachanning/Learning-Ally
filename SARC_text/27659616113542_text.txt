School Description
 
Our mission at César E. Chávez Elementary School is to nurture and teach students so that they will 
become confident, critical thinkers who possess a deep sense of responsibility to self and to their 
community.  By creating a safe learni
ng environment,  our students will engage in a rigorous 
learning environment and learn to effectively communicate and collaborate with others. We 
encourage the development of technological and bi
-
lingual skills in order to keep up with the 
world's constant
 
change and instill in them the appreciation of diversity by promoting positive 
interactions between all students, and encourage them to pursue their lifelong dreams.
 
 
César E. Chávez Elementary School serves approximately 800 students from preschool throu
gh 
sixth grade. Our student population includes 98.5 percent Hispanic students and 85 percent English 
Learners.
 
 
The Chávez teaching staff is committed to collaboration and articulation within and across grade 
levels. Our teaching staff is well trained to 
meet the needs of our English Learners as well as our 
English
-
speaking students.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) is very active; it closely partners with the school and 
community to work on projects during the school year. The School Site Council an
d Site Leadership 
(Learning)Team meet monthly to review student achievement data, analyze the effectiveness of 
programs, determine the progress of actions in the school plan, and revise the school plan as 
needed.
 
 
All members of the Cesar E. Chavez School 
community work together to provide each child with a 
successful school experience.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
César E. Chávez School is 23 years old.  The school garden has been remolded and turned into an outdoor classroom.  The grass
 
area has been upgraded 
by replacing a lime
-
treated area with new grass.  This motivates the students to keep their school safe and
 
clean.    A second play structure has been 
added to the playground area in order to service the student population better.  Our custodial and district maintenance staff
 
work hard to maintain a 
safe and clean campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smart

Professional development was delivered through grade level sessions during regular work days with release time for classroom 
teachers.
 
 
Teachers were supported during implementation by the 
site's Instructional Coach.
 
 
During the 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 school years, we continued with the same professional development and we added writing. Our data showed that 
writing was an area of weakness for our students and a teacher survey also showed that 
they were interested in professional development in this are. 
We used the program Write Up a Storm.

Types of Services Funded
 
In order to serve our students better,  every classroom received funding for classroom libraries to support and promote a cla
ssroom reading environment 
and to purchase math manipulatives to assist with the language demands of the new standards.  Teachers w
ere provided with release time for grade 
level collaboration and planning.
 
This year, all teachers all being trained on Wilda Storm writing strategies, English Language Development strategies and new 
curriculum. In addition, all 
teachers have also been tra
ined on GLAD strategies. Eureka Mathematics training is a focus for this year as well with the assistance of our curriculum 
and instruction department.  With the goal of equity for all students we have implemented a school wide music program for all
 
studen
ts pre
-
school 
through 6th grade.  All students receive integrated music instruction throughout the day, 1 day a week for the entire school 
year.
