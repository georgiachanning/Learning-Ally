Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
January 2019
 
 
To measure the implementation of the ELA and Math State Standards, MESD is utilizing BCOE's CA Standards 
Implementation Metric.  A modified version of
 
the CA state metric to measure the implementation of all other state 
standards was utilized. We selected these metrics and subsequent reflective survey tool to accurately analyze and reflect 
current implementation school wide. MESD has purchased state ado
pted ELA/ELD curriculums Benchmark Advance for 
TK
-
5th grade and Study Sync for 6th
-
8th grades. Engage New York/Eureka Math and the Aleks program have been 
purchased to utilize in our current Math programs.  Continued professional development for all facult
y and staff ensures 
successful implementation which also focuses on the implementation of EL standards. After analyzing the data, the 

implementat
ion includes adoption of CCSS aligned curriculums, PD on that curriculum, weekly allotted time for all faculty 
and staff to collaborate and analyze curriculum embedded assessments, CAASPP scores, CELDT scores, pacing guides, and 
create school wide thematic
 
project learning designed to reinforce California State Standards in all subject areas.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Manzanita Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. School facilities were built 
in 1962 and include 16 classrooms, school office, soccer field, basketball courts, multipurp
ose room and a 
library/gymnasium complex. All facilities are up
-
to
-
date and provide adequate space for students and staff. New outside 
picnic area and tables were put in by our Booster Club. We additionally added a new walking track and exercise stations 
t
hrough the support of the Booster Club, parents and community.
 
 
Cleaning Process: In the evenings and during the day, a team of three full
-
time custodians ensure classrooms, restrooms, 
office buildings and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. 
Removal of graffiti takes place prior to the start of school 
and repair of necessary facilities are prioritized accordingly. All electrical, plumbing, roofing, and fixtures are in good 
working condition and meet applicable building and government code requ
irements.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner. Work orders are used to ensure efficient service and highest priority 
is gi
ven to emergency repairs. Facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good learning.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

MESD believes that our 
educational program is a student
-
centered partnership with family, community and a passionate 
extraordinary staff.  All stakeholders have multiple opportunities to provide input and work collaboratively with regards 
to all district decision making and enco
uraged to participate in all governing board meetings and advisory committee 
meetings.  Agendas for monthly board meetings are clearly posted according to requirements of the Brown Act and an 
average of 19 parents attend as verified by attendance sign in s
heets. We also have at least 6 parents in attendance at all 
Booster Club meetings monthly with an additional average of 15 participates via the live Facebook feed.  We also have 
another five parents who participate in our SSC and an average of 6 parents wh
o attend our ELAC meetings. 74% of our 
parents attended Back to School Night and 81% attended our Open House.  The community is very supportive and we 
served over 1,000 people at our Fall Fest in September. MESD provides translation services for all events
, activities 
including parent conferences, IEPS and meetings with teachers or administration upon request 100% of the time.  MESD 
used the above measures as an accurate reflection of parental engagement.  We have implemented for this academic year 
to incre
ase the frequency of the LCAP advisory Committee meetings to allow ample time to review data throughout the 
year.

Professional development has been provided to our faculty regarding our newly adopted ELA programs Benchmark 
Advance and StudySync in the form of workshops, classroom coaching and modeling as well as 
early literacy intervention. 
Our ELD coordinators have also attended workshops and classes on designing EL programs, and administering the ELPAC. 
Teachers have also attended the CUE conference multiple years to learn how to better integrate technology into
 
our daily 
classroom instruction.   There is weekly collaboration built into our schedules with our faculty and monthly 
paraprofessional trainings.  We have also implemented the Nurtured Heart approach and there are several nurtured heart 
trainings for all
 
faculty and staff.  Release time for articulation and collaboration is provided to analyze and disaggregate 
student data to drive instruction. The data that was utilized to develop our professional development calendar was our
