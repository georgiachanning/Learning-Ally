About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repai
r, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student,
 
including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class se
ts, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitm
ent of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Education
al Services.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
River Bluff's Site Emergency Response Plan is prepared in compliance with Central Unified School District's Governing Board a
nd California Administrative 
Code, which requires all public schools,
 
kindergarten through community college, to have written emergency response plans. Our Site Emergency 
Response Plan is updated at the beginning of each school year. On October 10, 2019, the River Bluff administration presented 
the school safety plan to 
the
 
school site council for review and approval. All classrooms contain a yellow safety binder which describes/contains emergency
 
protocols. Each binder 
also contains a school
-
wide roster. During site preparedness drills, teachers display a red or green card 
indicating whether all students are accounted for. 
In addition, classroom numbers are painted on the blacktop to facilitate the efficient evacuation of the school building. The
 
Site Emergency Response 
Plan also includes primary and secondary evacuation loc
ations and emergency task force roles and responsibilities that our staff is trained in every year. 
Fire drills are conducted monthly, lockdown drills are conducted twice a semester, and earthquake
-
duck and cover drills are conducted quarterly. 
Annually, a
 
site Safety Walk is conducted by our district representative, Kevin Torosian (Supervisor of Student Support Services). His fi
ndings are reviewed 
with Administration and then shared with the staff at the following staff meeting in addition to the School Si
te  Council during the next quarterly School 
Site Council meeting.  Two
-
way radios and surveillance cameras have been provided.

River Bluff 
Elementary teachers in their first or second year of teaching are actively participating in the Teacher Induction program and
 
have a mentor 
who meets regularly with the teacher. Teacher Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exempl
ary teachers in the District as 
well as receive district training and attend professional workshops and seminars.
 
 
Every other week on a Principal Day, every teacher participates in staff development focusing on conferring with students to 
improve classroo
m 
performance as well as participating in a book study focusing on structured independent reading. Professional development tra
ining is delivered on
-
site 
and at the District Office by site administration, our reading intervention teacher, and other educati
onal professionals. All teachers received training in 
the newly adopted science curriculum and training to practice by site administrators and district Instructional Support Coach
es with the integration of 
ELA and science. The supports can include co
-
lesso
n planning, co
-
teaching and follow up debrief sessions. Training to practice implementation support 
is provided in grade levels, by an individual teacher or all staff professional development based on specific support needs. 
Student learning data drives 
th
e need for professional development. Grade level Professional Learning Communities (PLC) meet at least twice a week to analyz
e student learning 
(data), pedagogy, and common core,  which in turn drives instructional adjustments and supports in the classroom
. Our primary focuses this year for 
staff development are literacy in K
-
2, data analysis for grades 3
-
6, providing students with success criteria that supports them into becoming effective 
learners, creating effective learning environments, and using techn
ology to connect, engage, and provide opportunities for our 21st century learners. 
The Principal and the Guidance Instructional Advisor conduct weekly informal drop
-
in observations through the classrooms leaving constructive and 
reflective feedback.
