School Description
 
The faculty, administration and support staff provide an exemplary learning environment. 
Academic learning is the
 
primary focus of the school, but our teachers operate on the principle that 
a caring environment that fosters self
-
esteem
 
and individual development is the best approach 
toward facilitating learning. Students are able to approach all
 
facets of their learni
ng with 
confidence and assurance that this school is their home. Rules of conduct are realized
 
internally, 
leading to self
-
direction and initiative.
 
 
At Riverside Meadows Intermediate School, it is the belief of the staff, patrons, and students that 
our pr
imary purpose
 
is to maximize the intellectual, social, physical and emotional growth of our 
students. We are dedicated to students,
 
families and community working together to realize 
individual dignity and potential.
 
 
Riverside Meadows Intermediate serves 
over 400 students from the small community of Plumas 
Lake. We are currently a
 
6th
-
8th grade school. Our school currently runs a traditional 7 period day 
where all students have access to an
 
elective course. Classroom instruction is based on state 
content s
tandards that are taught, assessed, and then retaught
 
when necessary. We offer various 
types of interventions after the school day ranging from targeted standards
 
based support to 
general walk in homework or tutoring help. Our teachers are dedicated to the
ir students and are
 
always willing to assist students after school or during lunch hours to provide extra support.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

A school safety team was established and roles and duties were written.  Catapult EMS was implemented district
-
wide to serve as the online informati
on 
system for reporting, informing and updating district staff about emergency situations and threats.  Monthly drills are condu
cted utilizing the test
-
mode 
of Catapult EMS.  Staff practice responding to the emergency test threat with students and report b
ack to administration using the online Catapult EMS 
on their cell phones, laptops and tablets.
 
 
Riverside Meadows continually monitors the safety protocols for the school site.  Facilities are checked on a daily basis to 
help maintain a safe campus 
for our
 
students.

Professional Development provided for 
Teachers
 
Riverside Teachers participate in professional development every Monday through the use of early release days.  Professional 
development is on going 
and structured to ensure teachers meet the diverse needs of students.   Staff also has the opportu
nity to participate in "Non Student" days built into the 
schedule to provide training on best practices.  PLUSD also offers teacher lead professional development opportunities in the
 
areas of best practices and 
technology.  The site principal budgets confe
rences, trainings, and seminar fees each year so teachers can leave campus and receive training by 
professionals outside of our school district.   The school site principal also may budget content area consultants to provide
 
training in the area of 
instruc
tional strategies specific to a content area.  The consultants serve as instructional coaches to help provide specific feedba
ck and training to 
department staff on site and in the classroom.
