By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Kathryn Hughes Elementary School is a pre
-
school through fifth grade school of approximately 432 students in the Santa 
Clara Unified School District (SCUSD). Hughes is located in Santa Clara within a suburban commu
nity adjacent to San Jose. 
The area is bustling with new construction including new homes, affordable housing, and Silicon Valley industry. The Santa 
Clara Convention Center, Great America Theme Park, and San Francisco 49ers are our neighbors. The communit
y is socially 
and ethnically diverse. Transportation on the light rail system is conveniently located a few blocks away. Classes take the 
light rail on field trips to the Tech Museum, Discovery Museum and NASA. Built in 1964, the school was named for Kathr
yn 
Hughes, a former teacher in the Alviso School District for 39 years.
 
 
Hughes campus is a 48
-
year
-
old site, with large playground and turf areas. It includes 18 regular education classrooms as 
well as an office complex, library area, literacy resource ro
om, computer lab, special education resource room, and a 
multipurpose room (auditorium/cafeteria). Staff, parents and students take pride in an orderly and attractive facility. 
Restrooms for adults and students are ADA compliant. The facilities were modern
ized on the outside during the summer 
of 2003, 2007 (new parking and playground area) and new blacktop in 2008. The inside of the facility was modernized 
during the summer of 2004.
 
 
After a lot of hard work by the students and staff, Hughes was recognized 
as a California Distinguished School in April of 
2006. We are dedicated to upholding the programs and services that support our students in order for student 
achievement to continue to grow. The mission of Santa Clara Unified School District is to prepare 
students of all ages and 
abilities to succeed in an ever
-
changing world.
 
 
In 2012, Altera a, local company, granted money to increase Hughes' 21st century technology. Each classroom is equipped 
with a smart board and students K
-
5 have access to a tablet. T
hese tools are used by teachers and students to increase all 
skills needed for college and career and meet with the local and state curricular expectations. Hughes has become the 
classroom technology learning center for other teachers, schools and district
s. This grant was for three years and was 
renewed in October 2015. Hughes remains the classroom technology learning center for the district.
 
 
Mission Statement for Hughes:
 
At Kathryn Hughes we partner with our families and community to promote 
positive citizens of the 21st century, who 
communicate, collaborate, think critically and problem
-
solve creatively.
 
 
Our Vision:
 
We intentionally create lifelong learners using rigorous curriculum accessible by all. We promote 
social
-
emotional skills 
through respectful, responsible and safe practices.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes gre
at efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 

lities department at (408) 423
-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to devel
op cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school building comp
onents. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort to spe
nd taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in updated
 
technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambitious ro
of 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and security 
systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews campus
, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging play 
structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
The main campus of Hughes School was built in 1964. A Multi
-
Use Room was a
dded in 1982 and a classroom wing in 1986. 
Portables were added in 1997 for class size reduction. Buildings were modernized in 2004. This school has 30 classrooms, 
a multipurpose room, a library, a computer lab (portable), and an administration building.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school clima
te and safety, identifying 
goals and actions to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council
 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a safe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching ch
ildren positive social skills and attitudes including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school off
ice and was approved by the School Site Council in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, 
and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development opportunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for S
tudent Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students 
by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practices, cognitive development and learning disabilities, an
d best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, and instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicat
ed to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 school 
year, and eight days of professional development in t
he 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while assessing student work.
