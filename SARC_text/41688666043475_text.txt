By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A quaint school with a bright future opened its doors in 1953 with only five classrooms and almost 200 students. On 
January 28, 1954, this school was named after Mrs. Mae Nesbit. Mrs. Nesbit came to Belmont in 1932 as a te
aching 
principal. She then became a supervising principal and in 1942, she was appointed the superintendent of Belmont 
Elementary School, now Nesbit.
 
 
In 1996, Nesbit received its first California Distinguished School Award.
 
 
In 2004, Nesbit celebrated its
 
50th birthday.
 
 
In 2008, Nesbit was honored for a second time with a California Distinguished School Award.
 
 
In 2014, Nesbit was honored for a third time with a California Distinguished Schools Award.
 
 
In 2015, Nesbit was honored with a San Mateo 
County's School Board Kent Award.
 
 
Nesbit has grown tremendously since it first opened its doors.  There are now over
 
650 students in TK 
-
 
8th grade and two 
SDC classes as well as 70 staff members who call Nesbit School their home.
 
 

 
Nesbit School seeks to create a safe, nurturing and respectful learning environment where diversity is va
lued. To achieve 
this mission, Nesbit students, parents, and staff work collaboratively to help students acquire a solid academic foundation, 
build strong character, resolve conflicts, develop confidence, set and achieve challenging goals, communicate effe
ctively, 
and develop a love of learning.
 
 

 
Nesbit's Core Values are Respectful, Responsible, Safe and Inclusive.
 
 

 
"I am Trustworthy and Truthful and an Active Listener too.  I will do my Personal Best and use No
 
Put
-
Downs on you."

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental
 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged to volunteer at Nesbit in a variety of ways because the staff understands that the key to successful 
school experience is highly dependent upon parent engagement.  The following are opportunities for parents to be 
involved:
 
 
1.
 
Extensiv
e communication systems are in place to keep parents informed of Nesbit events 
--
 
the principal writes a 
weekly Wednesday Letter that is distributed to parents, teachers send home newsletters as well as create 
Shutterfly sites for communication, the websit
e is current and contains extensive content, and social media 
(Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) is used extensively to keep parents abreast of what occurs in the classroom.
 
 
2.
 
Nesbit's PTA and the district's School Force encourages parents to be actively in
volved in their children's education 
via volunteering within both organizations.  Additionally, both organizations host events designed to attract 
families and connect families to Nesbit.  Parents can seek information about volunteering by going to the PTA
 
section of Nesbit's website (https://nesbit.brssd.org/pta) or by emailing the president (president@nesbitpta.org).
 
 
3.
 
Classroom teachers encourage parents to volunteer in the classroom and to be involved in the classroom.  In 
addition to volunteering in the
