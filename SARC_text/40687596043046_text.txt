About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https:/
/www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Grover Heights Elementary School provides a 
safe, clean environment for learning. Built in 1960 and completely modernized in 2001, Grover Heights 
Elementary School is situated on 10.10 acres. The school buildings span 36,386 square feet and consist of 23 classrooms, a li
brary, multipurpose room, a 
c
omputer lab, resource and tutoring rooms, and office facilities. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through
 
its ample classroom and 
playground space.
 
 
Through a partnership with the city of Grover Beach, Grover Heights completed the sidew
alk near the bus loading zone and parking lot. The city made 
other improvements with funds acquired through the Safe Routes to School grant including: completing the sidewalks on Ritchie
 
Road and the bus loading 
zone, painting bike lanes on Atlantic City A
venue, and making the Fourth street crosswalk area more visible and safe.  A new MPR is in the beginning 
planning stages.
 
 
Grover Heights Elementary School is a closed campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participa
te in sc
hool events. 
Parents and visitors are welcomed and required to check
-

to the school office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school
, adults supervise students and school grounds, such as the 
cafeteria and recreation area, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and c
onduct inspections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely m
anner. A work
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given t
he highest priority. The District maintenance staff has indicated that 100 percent 
of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
A team of custodians ensures classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept clean and safe. A scheduled maintenan
ce program is administered 
by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide a suitable 
learning environment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District 
office.

School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the Dist
rict to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan provides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within
 
their Safe School Plans: 
current status
 
of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies related to suspe
nsion and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and eg
ress of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Pla
n, are 
reviewed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. The Injury, Illness & Prevention Plan was last updated and 
reviewed with school staff in 
August of 2019.

Career Technical Education Programs
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, 
particularly in light of the rapidly changing workforce technology and employment environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students grad
uating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified
 
School District have the preparation necessary for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolve
d in the 21st century, it became known as Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, trade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school, college and te
chnical traini
ng 
environments. This resulted in the need to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engag
es participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opportunities within a specific i
ndustry sector. High School Career Pathways provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario. 
 
 
Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one industry certification, or 
equivalent skill measurement, to provide 
a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate a
nd associate degree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and in some cases allow studen
ts to earn college credit for their coursework while still in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Education 
gives guidance for t
he design of model CTE programs in their plan for Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the State Board of Educati
on in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of career pathway programs o
f study for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with indus
try members and assembling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewing and developing curricul
um, reviewing instructor training needs, determining outreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs. 
 
 
The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway programs, and site administratio
n in the areas of curriculum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by attending workshops, confer
ences, and other training opportunities. Additionally, CTE instructors focus on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affect
s the structural make up of 
CTE
 
programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued to improve annually in the support of current programs that are functio
ning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from programs that currently functio
n as a single course, and establish new 
programs where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions through the Futu
re Farmers o
f America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had r
egional contest student 
winners, who competed in the various categories at the state level. Industry recognized certifica
tions include CPR, First Aid, Food Handlers, Serv Safe, 
Adobe, and CAD. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credit toward a degree within their field of study and som
e pathways offering 
multiple college courses. Additionally, students are ab
le to build resumes and portfolios with unique projects that demonstrate their level of expertise 
with industry desired skills. Through continually expanding internship programs available in various pathways, students are a
ble to gain real world 
experience
 
within their field of study that often times leads to employment.
