By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Citrus Elementary School is to provide a safe, positive environment in which individual students have the 
opportunity to meet their full po
tential academically, socially, emotionally, and creatively. Students will learn to respect 
themselves and others, as well as the world in which they live. The responsibility for helping students develop these 
essential skills will be shared by parents, sc
hool staff, community members and the students themselves. Citrus is 
committed to technology and has equipped the school, teachers, and students with the upgraded technology to be 
successful in a global society. We use a variety of resources and strategies
 
to work toward this goal.
 
 
Citrus Elementary is a neighborhood school located in an older part of Chico. The main school building was built in 1936 
making it the oldest operating school in the Chico Unified School District. We serve students in grades TK 
-
 
5 who come to 
us with a variety of backgrounds given the ethnically and socio
-
economically diverse make
-
up of the neighborhood.
 
 
Citrus is a school
-
wide Title I school. We receive federal categorical funding for Title I, and Title II, as well as funding 
to 
support our breakfast and lunch programs. Additionally, Citrus is able to provide extensive after school programs through 
the ASES Grant where students receive academic assistance and enrichment for three hours each afternoon.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 2019
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks th
at meet quality standards established by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were s
elected to match the needs of Chico students by a task force comprised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to 
review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th
 
grade state adopted list concurrent with the 
adoption cycle.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Citrus School, the oldest school plant in operation in the Chico Unified School District, was built in 1936. It is one of 12 
elementary schools in the District. Our facility houses 17 classes. Citrus also has a 
library media center, multi
-
purpose 
room, intervention rooms, counseling rooms, a staff work room, and a staff lunch room.  This year we opened a new pre
-
school for younger students.  Citrus was renovated during the 1989 school year with central air condit
ioning and heating 
added. The playground has been painted to include a holistic playground which provides learning activities for students 
to utilize. Citrus has also had a new playground installed which include a variety of apparatuses which support stude
nts 
with special needs. A security gate was installed in the front of the school for added protection and to ensure that all 
visitors to Citrus School sign in at the front office.  There has also been a gate installed in the far end of the campus whi
ch 
add
s additional security during the school day.  After school hours, and on the weekends, that gate is opened for public 
access to the campus. Outside lighting was also installed in the library for added security measures.  Security cameras 
throughout campus 
have also been installed There was also an ADA upgrade to the front steps and ramp.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Citrus Elementary 
welcomes and encourages parental involvement. We invite parents to become active members of our 
Parent Teacher Association. We have parents involved as members of our School Site Council and English Language 
Advisory Committee. We also encourage parents to
 
be involved in our classrooms and to participate in their children's 
educational program throughout the year. They are invited to attend trimester awards assemblies and a variety of other 
school
-
related activities and family
-
friendly events.
 
 
Citrus also 
offers different learning opportunities for parents throughout the year. These classes include district parenting 
classes which are hosted on different campuses throughout the district. Citrus maintains active social media accounts to 
engage and inform par
ents about upcoming opportunities for parental involvement. Individual teachers have 
implemented Classroom DOJO or other communication devices to inform parents of how they may get more involved in 
their child's education as well as informing them of behav
ior, being positive or negative to allow parents more 
communication and involvement in their child's progress.
 
 
In addition to parent support and involvement, we are also extremely fortunate to be an adopted school of the Bidwell 
Presbyterian Church whose 
members provide countless hours of volunteer service to the students and staff at Citrus 
School.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is updated annually in accordance with Senate Bill 187. We reviewed and updated our plan in 
September and followed the template and training provided by CUSD. Our plan includes a description of our site, our 
s
chool climate, an overview of our school discipline plan, our incident response team and a description of the 
responsibilities of the response team. Members of the team reviewed the plan, as did the School Site Council.

Staff and students regularly part
icipate in training and drills related to school safety. Citrus also has a crisis response team, 
emergency phone tree and a specific emergency action plan to cover a variety of situations. We have telephones in every 
classroom and indoor/outdoor intercom c
apability. We also have two
-
way radio communication for each teacher and 
campus supervisors. Citrus provides student supervision before and after school, and during all recess breaks. All visitors 
must sign
-
in at the office and wear a badge while on school
 
grounds.
 
 
In addition to our School Safety Plan, we have a comprehensive positive behavior support plan and school discipline plan 
that includes the major components of the Building Effective Schools Together Program. Additionally, we utilize the 
Second Step curriculum (violence reduction) with our students, and the Primary Intervention Program (PIP). We are 
continuously developing and implementing PBIS 
-
 
Positive Behavior Intervention System to improve our discipline 
procedures.

Citrus receives the following funding:
 

 
Safe Schools funds to provide training, resources, and technical assistance to 
establish a school/community 
environment which is physically and emotionally safe, well
-
disciplined, and conducive to learning.
 

 
Title II federal funds to provide ongoing staff development for teachers and principals.
 

 
Title I funds due to Free and Reduced L
unch qualifications. The intent of this funding is to meet the educational 
needs of low
-
achieving students enrolled in the highest poverty schools and to provide parent education.
 
 
* LCFF are federal funds allocated to the district which then are dissemina
te to school sites to support school resources. 
 

 
ASES (After School Education and Safety Program) state funds also support the school to provide improved 
academic achievement; enrichment services that reinforce and complement the academic program; family 
l
iteracy and related educational development services; and services to help the students meet state and local 
standards in core content areas. Programs are planned through a collaborative process that includes parents, 
youth, and representatives of particip
ating schools or local educational agencies, governmental agencies, 
community organizations, and the private sector. Instructional aides, parent aides, and resource teachers are 
all part of an intense instructional program to assist students' learning. Lib
rary clerks, guidance aides, a 
Targeted Case Manager and language liaison aides are also a part of this interdisciplinary team.
