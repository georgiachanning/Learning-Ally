Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Merlinda Elementary School serves approximately 534 students in grades Transitional Kindergarten through sixth. Our 
mission is to build a solid educational foundation in a nurturing and sa
fe environment to ensure all students are college 
and career ready. The primary focus is on developing our students as respectful, responsible, safe, and knowledgeable 
critical thinkers every day through their learning of 21st
-
century California State Stan
dards.
 
 
Students in need of specialized instruction are mainstreamed as much as possible into the general education setting per 
their IEP goals. The Special Education Teacher works collaboratively with the general education teachers to plan 
instructional o
pportunities aligned with the core curriculum. Modifications are made to make the core curriculum 
accessible to students. In addition, as appropriate, our special education students attend an Extended School Year (ESY) 
program in the summer to help maintai
n the knowledge learned during the regular school year. The Foster Youth Liaison 
has welcome meetings with foster youth to ensure they have all the necessary resources to be successful.
 
 
Our regular school day is from 7:38 AM to 1:48 PM for grades 1 throug
h 6. TK/Kindergarten regular dismissal is 1:38 PM.  
Every Wednesday is an early release day with dismissal at 12:48 PM in grades 1 through 6 and 12:38 PM in TK/Kindergarten 
so teachers can collaborate together and/or participate in professional development
 
activities. Our school doors open at 
7:00 AM and close at 3:30 PM daily.  We offer after
-
school program Y
-
ASES. Our library is open to all students on a daily 
basis for ongoing checkout of books needed for our extensive reading program.  We make extensive
 
use of educational 
technology.  Each Kindergarten through 6th
-
grade student is provided with an electronic device to check out for the school 
year. Technology is part of our daily academic program at Merlinda Elementary School.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We believe that it takes the entire community to achieve success, and parents are a vital part of the educational process.  
We treasure our parent volunteers at Merlinda and encourage every parent or guardian to volunteer or participate in 
their child's ed
ucation. The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and annual budget approvals are made by our 
School Site Council (SSC), which includes an equal number of parents and school staff members. Merlinda has parental 
representation on the District English 
Learner Advisory  Committee (DELAC) and Local Control Accountability Plan

earthquake, and active shooter); suspension and
 
expulsion policies; procedures for notifying teachers about dangerous 
pupils, discrimination, harassment bullying and hate crime policies/procedures; school
-

Merlinda Elementary School seeks to create a learning environment tha
t encourages high expectations for success through 
developmentally appropriate instruction that allows for individual differences and learning styles. Our school promotes a 
safe, orderly, caring, and supportive environment. Each student's self
-
esteem is fo
stered by positive relationships with 
students and staff using Capturing Kids' Hearts strategies. We strive to have our parents, teachers, and community 
members actively involved in our students' learning.

Merlinda implements a comprehensive and balanced reading program. We provide reading intervention four days a week 
for students in grades Kindergarten through 4th grade to achieve our district's goal that all students will read at grade 
level by 4th grade.
 
All students, including our English Learners, Foster Youth, Homeless, Socioeconomically Disadvantage 
Population, Title I, and Students with Disabilities are closely monitored as part of our LCAP goals.  Students identified as 
English Learners take the ELP
AC on an annual basis to determine levels of English proficiency.  English Learners participate 
in a Structured English Immersion program and receive daily English Language Development instruction for 30 minutes 
from their classroom teachers.  English Lear
ners at level 1 or level 2 of English proficiency are provided with primary 
language support from a bilingual instructional aide and take part in the Rosetta Stone program.
 
 
Students with special needs are accommodated in the least restrictive environment.
 
The Individual Education Plan (IEP) 
team develops a plan for students with learning, emotional, social, and/or developmental disabilities.
 
 
The Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program is provided to students in third through sixth grades who have met
 
the District criteria for participation in the GATE program.  GATE students receive in
-
class differentiated instruction and 
optional projects as made available through our GATE program.  Merlinda also offers after
-
school enrichment to all GATE 
students.
 
 
Funds are also utilized to further develop our educational technology programs.
