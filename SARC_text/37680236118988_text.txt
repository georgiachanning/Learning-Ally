School Description
 
McMillin School opened in September, 2001. It is comprised of 5 main classroom buildings, 4 
portable classrooms, Library/Media Center, an auditorium/cafeteria complex, an outdoor lunch 
court, a YMCA childcare center and an administration/health facility. T
he Library Media Center has 
been redesigned into a space where students and faculty can meet and learn.   We have 16 resource 
rooms that provide space for our Resource Specialist Program (RSP), Speech Therapist, Limited 
English Proficient aide, Psychologis
t, and our counselor with the Military Family Liaison Counseling 
Program.
 
 
At McMillin Elementary School, our students are engaged and active thinkers able to communicate, 
innovate, collaborate, and problem

empowers students to want to learn more and to take ownership of th
eir learning. Teachers and 

challenge and mistakes are embraced as learning opportunities. Group's collective thinking, as well 
as each individual's thinking, i
s valued, visible, and actively promoted as part of the regular day
-
to
-
day experiences. Students, parents, and teachers work collaboratively to ensure ALL student, 
including English Language Learners, students with disabilities, and designated target group
s, 
understand where they are, where they are going next, and show measurable growth on the 
learning progression which is based on CCSS. Learning Progressions will: (1) Communicate 
expectation to students and to teachers. (2) Locate current levels of work a
nd identify next steps, 
(3) Feedback is given around this learning progressions to cause learning and to serve each learner.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requ
ired by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs
) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an
 
LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff participates in District professional development opportunities in the area of Math, Language Arts and the implementati
on of Common Core State 
Standards. In addition to our classroom teachers, McMillin has four Visual and Performance Art teachers tha
t provide instruction in the areas of art, 
dance, music, and physical fitness. While these teachers are providing instruction in these areas, classroom teachers are giv
en the opportunity to 
collaborate and review instructional practices, as well as receive
 
professional development in identified areas of need.
 
 
McMillin used our achievement data in Math from the 2018
-
19 school year to determine our staff development for 2019
-
2020: McMillin will use a 6
-
8 
week Professional Learning Cycle targeting mathematics
 
around students' collaborative work in conversation in mathematics. Teachers worked on Unit 
planning and targeted learning intentions and success criteria for their math lessons. Speaking and listening standards were 
analyzed and incorporated 
into our mat
h lessons. We studied and implemented math blocks routines and incorporated best practices in collaborative conversations. Ou
r students 
are assessed quarterly with an online diagnostic math assessment to determine the success of our work around mathematics
 
and problem
-
solving.
 
 
McMillin used our achievement data in ELA from the 2017
-
18 school year to determine our staff development for 2018
-
2019: McMillin will use a 6
-
8 
week Professional Learning Cycle targeting our work on conferencing in a workshop model 
of instruction to ensure that students take ownership of their 
own learning by goal setting based on formative assessments, success criteria, and feedback measured by student's growth on a
 
learning progression of 
standards in reading.  (1) Students will un
derstand their goals and where/how they go next in their learning.  (2) Students will be able to communicate 
their learning goals in reading and writing and move these goals to habits that they will continue to practice.  (3) Students
 
will be able to use f
eedback 
from teachers and peers to improve their understanding of reading. We sent 4 teachers to New York to train at the Teacher Col
lege at Columbia 
University. These teachers provided in
-
class coaching. We provided release time for teachers to plan for t
heir grade level collaboration. Our students are 
assessed in running records, Level
-
set from Achieve 3000, and school
-
wide standards
-
based writing rubrics.
 
 
Staff development for 2017
-
18: Teacher training focused on Teacher College Reading and Writing syst
em, the Gradual Release of Responsibility 
instructional strategy model, the Imagine Learning program for English Language Development, and the implementation of Common
 
Core
-
aligned 
strategies. Professional Development for the 2016
-
17 school year focused on
 
readers' workshop, Student
-
teacher relationships, Restorative Practices, 
SIPPS strategies, analyzing data and student work, and the implementation of Common Core
-
aligned strategies.
