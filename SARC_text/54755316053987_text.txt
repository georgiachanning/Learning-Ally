School Description
 
Lincoln Elementary School is a Transitional Kindergarten through sixth grade elementary school 
where staff and 
families believe that students are destined for greatness.
 
 
Our goal is to work 
together to inspire and educate students so that they can reach their maximum potential 
academically, socially, and intellectually.
 
 
At Lincoln Elementary School we know that d
espite 
obstacles students face in their homes and in the community, they can and should attend school in 
a safe and supportive learning environment and receive instruction that prepares them to leave 
each grade on or above grade level in reading, writing, 
and math.
 
 
To achieve this, teachers 
collaborate weekly in grade
-
level teams to plan standards
-
based lessons and units, reflect on 
teaching practices and strategies, and to analyze student work and data.
 
 
Students who are 
struggling academically have acces
s to tiered supports and interventions to close achievement 
gaps.
 
 
English Learners receive English Language Development instruction as well as imbedded 
language supports within their school day.
 
 
Social and behavioral needs of students are met and 
support
ed through Positive Behavior Intervention and Support framework.
 
 
With a whole
-
child 
approach to education, we can help position students for success in college or careers help to break 
the cycle of poverty we see generationally in Dinuba.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of 
each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formul
a (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local 
priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, pare
nts/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Overall, our facility is in fair condition, given that it dates from the 1950s. The grounds and buildings are cleaned and mai
ntained regularly. We have 

 
needs.
 
 
Classroom roofs were replaced during the 2006

2007 school year and a fence 
at the front of the school was reinstalled a few years ago allowing the school to be more secure in the event of an emergency
. Additional improvements 
that have taken place
 
over the past few years include the remodeling of some student restrooms, installing tackboard on classroom walls, and repair
ing 
and maintaining the blacktop areas on the playgrounds.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

At Lincoln Elementary School we take pride in working closely with families and the community in the education of our student
s.
 
 
Our parent and 

ol program through the many hours that they serve 
our students and staff.
 
 
Our volunteers support the school in a variety of ways.
 
 
In the classrooms they help with material preparation, one
-
on
-
one 
tutoring, reading and working with small groups of student
s, assisting with classroom projects, and chaperoning field trips.
 
 
Parent and community 
volunteers also help in the office and the school library with shelving books, helping with the Book Fair, photocopying, and 
disseminating flyers.
 
 
 
 
Besides volunteer
ing, there are other opportunities for parents to become involved.
 
 
One opportunity to serve is on the School Site Council (SSC).
 
 
The 
SSC works closely with the principal to
 
develop and then annually update the
 
School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).
 
 
Parents of English Learners 
are encouraged to participate in the English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).
 
 
The ELAC committee is an advisory committee to the School Site Council 
and serves to represent and support the needs of our students learning Engl
ish. Our Lincoln Boosters Club is a parent
-
run organization that serves in 
supporting educational and recreational needs of Lincoln School students and
 
also serves as a vehicle for parent involvement and education.
 
 
They hold 
at least one major fund
-
raisin
g activity each year, with the goal of purchasing items that will enhance our school and benefit our students. One more
 
great 
opportunity for parent and family involvement is our Parenting Partners Workshops.
 
 
Parenting Partners Workshops is a 6
-
week serie
s of classes that 
help to build a strong family
-
school connection for the purpose of improving student academics and reading levels so that our students are ready to 
reach their college/career goals.
 
 
These workshops are offered in English and Spanish.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
A safe campus is a priority of Lincoln Elementary School.
 
 
Our site is fenced and there is one open gate at the front of the campus wher
e all visitors must 
enter and visitors are expected to check into the office upon arrival. 
Certificated and classified staff members conduct student supervision on campus 
before school, during recesses and lunches in the cafeteria and on the playground, an
d after school to ensure student safety.
 
 
We routinely conduct fire, 
earthquake, and emergency drills.
 
 
An Emergency Response Code System has been developed in order to quickly and appropriately respond to student 
behavior and other student needs during th
e school day. 
 
The Emergency Response Team are connected via walkie
-
talkies for immediate response to 
classrooms and on campus when necessary.
 
 
A Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports framework has been implemented and behavior expectations have been 
established for all the areas of 
the school (classroom, playground, bathrooms, cafeteria, library, office, hallways, etc.). 
 
Students are taught and know the behavior expectations called 

play safely, and show respect.
 
 
Students have opportunities to be rewarded and 
recognized for exemplifying these qualities. Lincoln Elementary School has been recognized by the California PBIS Coalition a
s a "Platinum" level school 
for our PBIS program.
 
 
T
he Student Agenda/Handbook includes the PBIS expectations, rewards, and the steps for correcting inappropriate behavior.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan is updated each school year and is approved by the School Site Council.

Types of Services Funded
 
State and Federal funds are used to help supplement and support core programs to increase student achievement by providing pr
ofessional development 
for teachers and 
staff, purchasing additional
 
materials and supplies, and providing additional academic support for students.
 
 
Student Body funds are raised annually through school fundraisers such as a school carnival, T
-
shirt sales, and a book fair. These funds help pay 
for field 
trips, student incentive programs, and library books. Our Lincoln Boosters Club has raised money for student activities, rewa
rds and incentives, 
recreational supplies, and additional playground equipment.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online da
ta tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specific
ally, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at
 
public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Interne
