PAL™S M
ESSAGE
Knolls Elementary School provides a positive and well-rounded academic program for all children. 
Our staff is focused on improving student academic achievement and character development. 
The Knolls staff regularly evaluates our academic program and identifies an instructional focus. 
The teachers at Knolls provide students whole class, small group, and individualized instruction. 
An Intervention Teacher provides support to students who have difficulty meeting grade level 
standards in reading and math. Additionally, a Specialized Academic Instruction teacher and aide 
provide support for students with Individual Education Plans. Recognition for positive behavior 
and performance is provided within individual classrooms, and through Character Awards 
Assemblies and Honor Roll Awards. Knolls has a very active PTA that sponsors school assemblies, 
field trips, family fun nights, Jr. Olympics, the Reflections Art Program and funding for classroom 
projects. 
Knolls Elementary is pleased to announce the continuation of our Project-Based Learning (PBL) 
focus. The shift for this new focus arises from the question: How do we better prepare our students 
for this ever changing world? PBL is an instructional strategy that will allow students to learn 
concepts involving critical thinking, problem solving, time management, and collaboration skills. 
Essentially, PBL allows the students to take ownership of their learning and become the catalysts 
for project ideas, questions, and designs, resulting in a student-centered learning environment. 
Knolls creates students who are engaged in their educational experiences. For more information,

The California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System includes 
the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general education 
population, and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligible students may participate in the administration 
of the CAAs.  CAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked 
with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well 
students are mastering California™s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and 
mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess 
student performance in ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and 
performance tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with alternative achievement standards 
which are linked with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). 
The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district 
and state scores as well as the school™s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are 
shown only for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories 
that are blank in the tables, no students met subgroup criteria. More information on CAASPP 
can be found on the California Department of Education™s website www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/.  
PHYSICAL
 FITNESS
In the spring of each year, Knolls 
Elementary is required by the state to 
administer a physical fitness test to 
all students in grade five. The physical 
fitness test measures each student™s 
ability to complete fitness tasks in six 
major areas. Students who either meet 
or exceed the standards in all six fitness 
areas are considered to be in the ﬁhealthy 
fitness zone.ﬂ The chart disclosed in this 
document reports only the percentage in 
each category, not a cumulative total of 
the results for categories 4 of 6 and 5 of 6. 
Comparative district and state results can

monitor playground activity.  At the end 
of the day when students are dismissed, 
campus supervisors monitor student 
behavior to ensure a safe and orderly 
departure.

requirements. Components of this plan 
include child abuse reporting procedures, 
teacher notification of dangerous pupil 
procedures, disaster response procedures, 
procedures for safe arrival and departure

 INSPECTIONS
On an annual basis, schools are required 
by the state to perform a comprehensive 
inspection and report those findings to 
the school community. The most recent 
inspection for Knolls Elementary School 
took place on November 21, 2019. The 
School Facility Good Repair Status table 
illustrated in this report identifies the state-
required inspection areas and discloses the 
operational status in each of those areas.
