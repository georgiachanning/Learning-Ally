About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains
 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes 
how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SAR
C requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent thre

year period.
 
 
Sunset teachers build teaching skills and 
learn concepts by participating in professional conferences and workshops throughout the school year. At these 
conferences and workshops they discuss quality of instruction, ways for teachers to improve classroom practices, and innovati
ons in education. We
 
determine the areas of focus for staff development through analysis of student achievement data and collaboration with teache
rs. Currently, Sunset has 
participated in staff development for Kagan Strategies, Time to Teach, Positive Behavior Intervention Su
pport (PBIS) Nonviolent Crisis Intervention, 
AED/CPR, NaviGate, RAPTOR, Imagine Language and Literacy, CAASPP test
-
taking strategies as well as Hatching Results (counseling). All trainings have 
been offered to create a positive and safe learning environmen
t, increase teacher efficacy,  and improve student behavior on our campus. We also have 
coaching and workshops provided by our Instructional Technology Coach on a variety of topics throughout the school year.
