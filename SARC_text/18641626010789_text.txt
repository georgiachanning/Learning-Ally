School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Termo District  Board of Trustees holds a Public 
Hearing annually. At the annual meeting, the Board of 
Trustees determined that the students in the Ravendale

8, have sufficient textbooks or 
instructional materials, or both, in each subject that are consistent with the con
tent and cycles of the Curriculum 
Framework adopted by the State Board of Education. In addition, the Board by resolution determined that every pupil, 
including English learners, has sufficient textbooks or instructional materials consistent with the conte
nt and cycles of the 
Curriculum Framework adopted by the State Board of Education in the following subject areas: mathematics, science, 
history
-
social science, and English/language arts, pursuant to settlement the of Williams vs. the State of California 
(E
ducation Code Section 60119). All students, including English learners, are given their own individual Standards
-
aligned 
textbooks and instructional materials in the core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.  The most current 
adoptions conta
in specific curriculum for technology use where teachers and students can take advantage of our many 
classroom computers and other internet devices.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school is in excellent shape as it is barely twenty years old. Recent facility improvements include an upgraded fire 
extinguisher system in the kitchen, installation of security cameras, and a ne
w crack seal/overlay on the student blacktop 
area.   During the 2015 summer, the site was shared with a BLM Command Center.  Extensive work was done on improving 
the overall campus, including weeding, grading and planting of native vegetation.  Through Pro
p 39 funds, the school was 
retrofitted with improved lighting and heating & lighting controls.  District Administration utilizes the Facility Inspection
 
Tool (FIT) developed by OPSC to survey facility needs on a regular basis.  The most recent inspection w
as done in August, 
2019.
 
 
Through the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), the District prioritizes facility and maintenance needs for the school 
each year and provides budgetary resources to keep the school site in top condition for optimized student
 
learning.  Blinds 
were installed in all classrooms in the fall of 2016 through input in the LCAP process.  The blacktop playground was resealed
 
and re
-
striped during the summer of 2018.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the CA

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved Level 3

Parents are always welcome to be involved with the student learning process. They are invited to visit the school, help in 
classrooms, attend field trips, and participate in 
award assemblies and presentations. Numerous events are held 
throughout the year that provide opportunity for parents and the community to be a part of the learning environment.  
To keep parents informed about the school events, a monthly calendar is sent

The school safety plan provides for all disaster scenarios and is updated annually as required by the California Department 
of Education. The Lassen County Sheriff's Department shares valuable tactical information with the District 
to support 
student safety at the school during lockdowns or other emergencies.  The plan was most recently updated in February 
2019.  The plan is discussed with all staff at the beginning of each school year. For a copy of the plan, please contact Jaso
