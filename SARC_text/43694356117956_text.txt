James F. Smith Elementary School (JFS) is the 17th school to open in the Evergreen School District. 
It is located in the eastern foothills of the 
Mt. Hamilton Range. JFS, as it is often referred to, opened 
in the fall of 2000 with 190 students and nine teachers. Our enrollment is approximately 650 
students and we have 25 fulltime teachers.  Our curriculum is based on the California Standards of 
Achi
evement. JFS teachers are committed to providing a balanced curriculum that integrates 
technology and the latest researched
-
based teaching strategies. They take responsibility for their 
professional growth and provide training to their colleagues in areas 
of their individual expertise.  
JFS teachers are in leadership roles at the school and at the district level.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The mission of James Franklin Smith Elementary School is captured in our school motto: "Learning 
Today, Leading Tomorrow". We s
trive to develop the intellectual, physical and emotional capacities 
of each child by providing a strong foundation in academics and social
-
emotional growth. Our belief 
is that all children need to think critically and be able to adapt to the changing land
scape of the 
21st Century. Students acquire skills in analyzing, processing, and using information to make 
informed decisions and to collaborate and communicate with others. At JFS students develop self
-
esteem by participating in a caring school community 
which appreciates diversity, creativity, 
tolerance and mutual cooperation.  Students learn in a traditional but progressive environment 
that will include innovative instructional strategies and technological advances. Our students will 
embrace the impact o
f technology on society and in their daily lives. Students will be active 
participants in their own learning by providing opportunities to create, build and explore. Students 
will ultimately extend these skills and talents to the local and global community
 
as contributing 
members of society. Teachers will be responsible for guiding the learning process, setting goals and 
fulfilling instructional standards set forth by district and state mandates. Students will learn to make 
good choices and create a lifesty
le that will promote a healthy body and mind. Students will develop 
leadership skills to help each student accomplish his or her goals.
 
 
Community & School Profile
 
Evergreen School District, located in the City of San Jose, is comprised of fifteen elementa
ry schools 
and three middle schools. Once a small farming city, San Jose became a magnet for suburban 
newcomers between the 1960s and the 1990s, and is now the third largest city in California. San 
Jose is located in Santa Clara County also known as Silico
n Valley. It has over one million residents. 
Evergreen school district is in the southeast of the valley and JFSmith is located in the area called 
Silver Creek. JFSmith provides a family
-

grow, and 
develop intellectually. We have numerous after
-
school programs: academic, recreational 
and enrichment.  We have partnerships with more than a few agencies: YMCA, PeaceMakers, 
YWCA, Starting Arts, Math Olympiad, Allstars United, Boy and Girl Scouts, Camp Ga
lileo and many 
other smaller programs that provide extra
-
curricular activities for our students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and ins
tructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in 
the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned with the C
alifornia State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typicall
y adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional material
s used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
material
s in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
James F. Smith Elementary School, originally constructed in 2000, is currently comprised of 31 permanent classrooms, a YMCA r
oom, a conference room, 
a computer lab, a library, a cafeteria/multipurpose 
room, a staff lounge, two work rooms, and two playgrounds. The district passed a facilities bond 
measure in 2006 that will allow for future modernization at all school sites. The chart displays the results of the most rece
nt facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleanin
g Process:
 
James F. Smith Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has 
adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis thr
oughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensur
e a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

h heavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacatio
n periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair.
 
A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency rep
airs are given the highest priority; repair requests are 
completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar

is, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor sys
tems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has take
n 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good repair.

al school program. Our School Site Council, which consists 
of parents and teachers, meets bi
-
monthly to promote ways to enhance the programs and services of JFS. Our English Language Advisory Council (ELAC) 
provides parent involvement in the monitoring of 
services for second
-
language learners. Many parents provide support as classroom assistants and 
chaperones on field trips and school activities.  In addition, an Arts Attack program has parent volunteers who work in class
rooms once a month creating 
art pro
jects that support our curriculum.  PTA supports Starting Arts, Math Olympiad and plans social events for the entire school s
uch as Walk to School, 
Game Nights, Movie Night, Family Picnic, College and Career Week, and more. At the beginning of the year, ou
r PTA  holds the first day of school parent 
welcome breakfast inviting parents to socialize and participate in supporting JFS school events.  PTA uses their funds to gen
erously donate money to 
each classroom. Parent committees are generated throughout the 
school year as needed. Contact our PTA at jfspta.org. or view their website news at 
eesd.org/JFS. Also, This year, parent education was provided in after school seminars on Child Resiliency, Bullying, Socio
-
emotional regulation, Child 
Abuse and Cyber monit
oring. Parent education is well attended and strengthens parent / teacher partnerships.

and wear a visitor

s pass at all times during their stay on school grounds. We also have security cameras placed at strategic locations with a 
monitor in 
the school office. There is also a designated area for student drop
-
off and pick
-
up at the front and side of the school.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated in December 2018
 
by the School Site Council and Emergency Response Team. Any revisions 
to the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff and to the Emergency Response Team (ERT).The Sc
hool Safety Plan will be 
reviewed again this winter and revi
sed as needed by February 15, 2019. Any changes and/or revisions will be approved by the safety committee and

19 We focused on Professional Learning Communities whereby teachers analyzed student work and collaborated on Lesson Design t
o meet the 
needs of the students. Teachers were given time to observe, collaborate, and discu
ss instructional practices and student work with the assistance and 
support of the principal and expert colleagues. Additionally, we have a strategic plan for integrating computer standards thr
ough progressive robotics 
and coding. This year, our budget sup
ported a part
-
time STEAM coordinator to organize and assist with the building of a hands
