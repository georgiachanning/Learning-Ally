By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

aintain a nurturing learning environment that:
 

 
Enables students to make well
-
reasoned choices;
 

 
Inspires living with integrity and concern for others;
 

 
Cultivates an appreciation for lifelong learning; and
 

 
Increases adaptability to change in a diverse, ever
-
changing world.
 
With 608 students, K.L. Carver Elementary School offers a challenging educational program that is closely matched with 
the developmental and educational needs of each child. Instruction is grounded in rigorous content that goes far beyond 
t
he basics. Well
-
trained professionals effectively use high
-
quality instructional materials aligned to Common Core State 
Standards. Students become literate seekers of knowledge who develop competent critical thinking, problem
-
solving, and 
communication ski
lls. These skills are applied in core content areas including reading/English
-
language arts, mathematics, 
social studies, science, visual and performing arts, and health/physical education. Carver also was named a California 
Distinguished School in 2018 an


prestigious National Blue Ribbon Award in 2005, an
 
honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. All students 
have access to the core curriculum. In both the mainstream and special programs, those students with special needs 
(English learners, gifted/talented, and individuals with special needs) rec
eive customized support designed to access the 
core curriculum in ways best suited to individual learning styles. Invigorating, creative teaching and learning occur in a 
safe environment where positive attitudes and behavior are expected and achieved. Good
 
citizenship and personal 
accountability for behavior are an integrated part of every activity.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Carver Elementary School facilities are clean, saf
e, and functional.  No Williams Complaints have been filed. A School 
Facility Conditions Evaluation is done each year by the Director of Maintenance and Operations. A copy of the latest Facility
 
Inspection Tool (FIT) can be found at https://goo.gl/SMtg2j. 
An evaluation of all school facilities conditions is completed 
annually in the fall. Facilities Inspection Tool is an annually required inspection and is intended to report on the existing
 
conditions of various aspects of our school facilities. This is not
 
a tool intended to evaluate equipment. This doesn't reflect 
repair costs, equipment efficiency, or the frequency of repair since the previous year's FIT. This is a snapshot in time 
evaluating a predetermined list of the facility equipment and conditions. 
This inspection is not designed to use as a capital 
improvement tool.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prio
rity: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the
 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with al
ternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements
 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
On the whole, the students are academically focused and thus, there are very few discipline problems.  Open and honest 
relationships among teachers, children, parents, and 
administration are a solid foundation for a safe school environment.  
In the spring of 2018 students in grade five completed the California Healthy Kids Survey, please see the results at 
https://tinyurl.com/r4lrwjk. A Comprehensive School Safety Plan is mo
nitored and updated as appropriate by a 
representative team of school, parents, and community members on the School Site Council in compliance with Education 
Code 52012 and 52842.

The San Marino Unified School District students outperform their grade level peers throughout the state on nearly all 
indicators reported on the 
California School Dashboard (https://www.caschooldashboard.org/). However, professional 
development primary/major areas of focus have been developed through a review of that data along with other locally 
collected data, site and district level needs assess
ments, and engagement with the community. Eight (8) teachers from 
each school site were sent to the two
-
day UDL Boot Camp for Teachers, Presented by Dr. James Mckenna at the West San 
Gabriel Valley (WSGV) Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA). This two
-
day in
-
person workshop is designed to provide 
teachers with a clear understanding of why Universal Design for Learning is essential, how it incorporates research in 
learning and motivation, and what the actual framework entails. Participants will engage i
n a collaborative examination 
of lessons to identify UDL in action and generate opportunities for further implementation. Furthermore, these same 
teachers were sent to a two day follow up UDL Implementation Academy where they learned about the phases of UD
L 
implementation, determine where the organization is in the implementation process, and create a plan for moving 
forward. Participants workshopped ideas received and provided feedback, and identified the next steps in the UDL 
journey. Teachers in this ses
sion explored the systems and infrastructure that support UDL implementation, practiced 
protocols that support the scaling of UDL, determined areas for growth in your own setting, set short
-
term and long
-
term 
goals, and designed an implementation plan. Add
itionally, one (1) to two (2) representatives from each school site were 
sent to SPORT2 Suicide Prevention Training with the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) and the Department 
of Mental Health (DMH) to learn more about aligning district prac
tices and policies with AB2246, Multi
-
Tiered System of 
Support (MTSS), and Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS). Moreover, those same staff members were 
sent to a four (4) day Foundations of a Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) training 
to learn how to develop a 
framework for providing tiered teaching and interventions around academic, behavior and social
-
emotional supports that 
address the needs of ALL students. The District team aligned the system of initiatives, supports, and resources
, organize 
and plan our MTSS efforts and began to plan the continuous improvement processes at all levels of the system to meet 
the needs of the whole child.

strengths and challenges.  The goal of the program is to improve student performance in the core content areas. 
Throughout the 2019
-
2020 school year, the Carver faculty will focus professional learning on the Next Generation Science 
Standards
 
(NGSS) and Character Counts.  Professional Development time is used to address the above goals and other 
instructional pursuits with input from the elementary leadership team, consisting of teachers and the principal. Teachers 
participate in faculty meeti
ngs, professional development activities, and individualized programs as appropriate to teacher 
needs.
