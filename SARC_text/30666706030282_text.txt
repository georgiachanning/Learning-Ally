School Description
 
Thomas Jefferson Elementary School (Jefferson Elementary) is a Dual Immersion, English/Spanish 
school within SAUSD and is located in the Southern most end of central Orange County, in 
California.  Jefferson Elementary's boundaries are ex
tended to include two surrounding 
neighborhoods. These extensions cover the areas that surround two fundamental school sites. A 
little over one third of Jefferson's population come from these nearby neighborhoods, and these 
students are transported by bus 
to Jefferson, as many of them reside up to two miles from the 
campus. Another third of Jefferson's population come from the school's surrounding single
-
family 
homes and apartments. The remaining student population come from neighborhoods belonging to 
other
 
schools and other cities and enroll as inter
-
 
or intra
-
district transfers to attend the K
-
5 Spanish 
Dual Immersion Program. Jefferson Elementary is one of the six district schools that offer a K
-
5 Dual 
Immersion program. Jefferson utilizes the 90/10 Dual 
Immersion model.
 
 
Jefferson Elementary's K
-
5 Dual Language Immersion program is a unique opportunity that brings 
together Spanish and English speaking students in an effort to develop full bilingualism in English 
dominant students, and English learners. Th
e Dual Immersion program celebrated its 15
-
year 
anniversary during the 2014
-
2015 school year. Enrollment is open to kindergarten and first grade 
students residing within and outside of the district. Participating students acquire knowledge in all 
academic 
subjects to either meet or exceed academic standards established by the state. Beginning 
in kindergarten, students receive 90% of instruction in Spanish and 10% in English. The percentage 
of Spanish decreases as the percentage of English increases, until s
tudents begin their fifth grade 
year, with 50% of instruction in English and 50% in Spanish. For more information about the Dual 
Immersion program, please visit our school office or visit the school's website.
 
 
Jefferson Elementary staff strive to instill 
in each student a sense of responsibility, scholarly pride, 
and a positive self
-
image by building an effective home
-
school partnership. Parents are encouraged 
to be active participants in their child's educational success. Parents are asked to volunteer 
th
roughout the school year by choosing to participate as committee members, volunteer in their 
children's classrooms, or participate in and attend school
-
wide activities. We believe that parent 
involvement is critical to the overall success of each child. Pa
rent involvement is highly valued and 
encouraged here at Jefferson Elementary.  In all of our comprehensive programs, Jefferson 
Elementary maintains a commitment to provide a strong instructional program. Teachers, staff, 
and administration adhere to the p
rinciples of putting students first, creating success for all 
students and building scholars one student at a time.
 
 
Vision:
 
Jefferson Elementary staff will provide a safe and positive learning environment with the 
collaborative efforts of parents, staff, 
and the school community. By delivering a 21st century 
education and presenting intellectually challenging materials while developing social skills and self
-
esteem, scholars will become college and career ready and prepared to succeed in a complex and 
dive
rse global society.
 
 
Mission:
 
To implement our vision, the Jefferson staff will provide a quality Common Core standards
-
based 
instructional program that meets the needs of all scholars, fostering mutual respect and 
collaboration, and building self
-
esteem, 
integrity, and confidence in a rich, safe and supportive, 
academic environment.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountab
ility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and A
ccountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in
 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, 
see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district offi

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and 
Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 

ualified, professional trade specialists. Emergency situations are immediately resolved either by the school custodian 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and 
with the pri
ncipal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and principal
 
inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

strongly emphasized as a component of th

chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards an
d prioritization procedure
s 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and re
strooms. Groundskeepers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.
