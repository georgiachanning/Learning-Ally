elementary schools in the San Ramon Valley Unified School District we bring to our community an 
enthusiastic, well 
trained staff that is dedicated to providing a safe and nurturing environment 
where each student's individuality is valued and where all students, families, and staff are treated 
with respect.
 
 

ding and Writing Workshop programs, 

with the Silicon Valley Math Initiative, maintaining an instructional program that integrates 
practices from the Common Core
 
Standards. Our model classrooms and the excellent instructional 
practices we provide here at Quail Run are frequently used as demonstration classrooms for others 
who are also learning more about these research
-
based best practices. Our commitment to 
provi
ding a rigorous, meaningful curriculum that focuses on the Common Core Standards is 
evidenced throughout our campus.
 
 
Quail Run Elementary is also in the forefront of technology integration. Our Quail Run Learning 
Fund (QRLF) has sponsored a 1 to 1 laptop 
program for all fourth grade students and a 1 to 1 
chromebook program for all fifth grade students. Additionally, teachers and students have access 
to grade level specific iPad carts of 30 iPads. These programs enable students to go deeply into 
curriculum 
at a new level of understanding. Each classroom has a document camera, Redcat 
microphone, and projector to enhance teaching and learning. Additionally, students have access to 
a computer lab as well as 3 mobile carts of Chromebook laptops. Our staff attend
s ongoing training 
and collaboration to assist our integration of technology best practices.
 
 
Our mission is to meet the needs of each and every student so that they may reach their greatest 
potential. Through differentiated instruction we provide an acade
mic program that is rigorous, 
engaging, and standards based.  We are proud of our inclusive model which offers an exceptional 
program for all students.

School Profile
 
Welcome to the Quail Run Elementary School SARC report. We are the home of the Explorers! Quail Run is one of San Ramon Valle
y 

l new campus in August, 2006, and have opened our doors 
to hundreds of new families since that time. Quail Run is a K
-
5 elementary school housing approximately 950 students and is located in 
the Gale Ranch community of the Dougherty Valley. As our communit
y grows around us, we have the capacity to house up to 1100 
students.
 
 
Our highly qualified and enthusiastic staff members are dedicated to developing lifelong and self directed learners who excel
 
academically 
and grow personally by providing 
academic excellence in a nurturing, respectful, student centered environment built on a foundation of 
family, community, and staff collaboration.
 
 
The Quail Run curriculum is standards based and rigorous, utilizing a philosophy of differentiated instructio
n in order to meet the needs 
of all learners. Our Response to Intervention model provides opportunities for each student to excel at their academic level 
in every 
subject area. Our GATE program provides a variety of extension activities throughout the year
, such as the Math Olympiad and Destination 
Imagination. Our Response to Intervention Plan assists us in determining the level of support students need.  Through consist
ent, focused 

ds in a collaborative environment. A resource teacher, a speech 
and language therapist, occupational therapist, and school psychologist provide support to students as is indicated by assess
ed needs. 
Our School Success Team and Response to Intervention Team
 
meet regularly to identify focused interventions for students in need of 
more support.
 
 
We are proud of our Makerspace classroom where students will have the opportunity to have hands
-
on experiences. A Makerspace is a 
classroom stocked with tools and 
materials that allow students to create, problem solve and collaborate on projects. Makerspaces allow 
students to take control of their own learning as they take ownership of projects that they have not just designed but also d
efined. The 
Makerspace is tra
nsformative in student learning.  The students will be discovering together as they work their way through a project as 
a group.  There is not one set solution, so students will be learning through their own curiosity, being creative, thinking c
ritically, 
communicating and collaborating together.  The Makerspace allows students to be true scientists, learning through experience,
 
reflecting 
throughout the process and continuing to modify their models to improve their solution.  Students as young as kindergar
ten, can learn 
through this hands
-
on, real
-
life approach.
 
 

 

opportunities for our students in order to support 21st Century Le
arning.  Each classroom is equipped with a document camera, an LCD 
Projector that is connected to a DVD/VCR, a Redcat microphone, and laptop computer.   Our computer lab provides opportunities
 
for 
classes to utilize computers for instructional purposes.  W
e have 15 COWS (Computers on Wheels) in order to support our one to one 
laptop program for fourth and fifth grade students.  We have a library collection of over 40,000 books with an internet based
 
check out 
system for easy accessibility.  A leveled librar
y with portable scanner is available to staff members for easy check out in order for classroom 
leveled libraries to be rich and varied.  Our goal is to provide as many leveled books as possible to each and every classroo
m.
 
 
Our school has been recognized 
with Digital Citizenship Certification through Common Sense Media. Teachers provide lessons in grades 
K
-
5 on topics such as cyberbullying and digital drama, oversharing of information, digital cheating and plagiarism, and underst
anding how 
to analyze and e
valuate the credibility of websites.
 
 
We proudly educate the whole child! Each student at Quail Run participates in sessions in the library/media center, computer 
lab, and 
receives vocal music instruction, as well as art instruction. Fourth and fifth grade
rs have the opportunity to take weekly instrumental 
music classes with our exceptional music teacher. Quail Run offers two after school choruses, performing arts opportunities, 
and a variety 
of after school classes. Recently, we have been recognized as a C
alifornia Gold Ribbon school, earned our Common Sense Media 
certification, and have been designated as a No Place for Hate from the Anti
-
Defamation League. Quail Run, along with the other SRVUSD 
schools, have implemented Culturally & Linguistically Respons
ive (CLR) teaching strategies in all classrooms.  We build strong relationships 
with our students to create a safe and nurturing learning environment.
 
 

nstruction is embedded into the 
work we do each day, through our Soul Shoppe program, Sanford Harmony, Student Council, Project Wisdom and through our school
-

 
variety of programs for families, 
as well as extra support in the areas of music, art, reading, math, computer and library support. We are also recognized a No
 
Place for 
Hate by the Anti
-
Defamation League. We also provide many after school enrichment oppo
rtunities including Board Game club and Athletic 
Club. During recess, we have art at recess once a month and students have daily access to a game shed full of board games.
 
 
Other areas of outstanding involvement are the Quail Run PTA and Quail Run Learning
 
Fund. These groups contribute considerable funds, 
service, time, and energy. The PTA sponsors several excellent assemblies for students during the school year. Both organizati
ons sponsor 
community events such as our Multi
-
Cultural Night, Movie Night, and 
Breakfast Book Club, to name a few.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about 
the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educ
ational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

School Safety Plan
 
Quail Run Elementary School is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain the conditions which contrib
ute to the best 
possible 
learning environment and ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the School Safety Committee has created a compre
hensive Disaster 
Preparedness Plan. Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated for effectiveness. These drills i
nclude procedures for fire, earthquake, stranger 
danger, and shelter in place. Each classroom has an emergency pack and disaster plan to follow in case of a crisis.The school
 
maintains a trailer containing 
emergency supplies for the entire school.  All sch
ool employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected child abuse or child neglect. Reports 
are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary. Quail Run strictly adheres to district 
policies which prohibit harassment or discrimination of any kind. Quail Run believes that a safe and orderly environment is n
ecessary to ensure a positive 
learning experience for all students. Ongoing supervision is the core of creating and maintaining a s
afe and orderly environment. Staff and parent 
volunteers continually supervise and interact with students to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
 
 
Visitors are required to check in at the office and volunteers and visitors wear identific
ation badges while on campus.  Adults supervise the playground 
at all recesses and at lunchtime. Staff members supervise the front and back of the school before and after school. There is 
an adult crossing guard on 
the main road for arrival and dismissal o
f students. All supervising adults wear identifying safety vests. There are walkie
-
talkies in the office, playground 
areas, and other pertinent areas. Playground and school safety rules are reviewed with students in class during the first wee
k of school. O
n the first day 
of school students are given a guided tour of the school facility, introduced to key staff members, and are reminded about sc
hool etiquette and safety.

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University
 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experie
nces are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team 
and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, in
tentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These co
horts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teache
rs are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our
 
Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the di
strict as a whole is enhanced.
