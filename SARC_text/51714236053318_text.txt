Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Nuestro Elementary School is a small, somewhat old
-
fashioned, s
chool nestled in a local farming community at the base 
of the Sutter Buttes.  All members of the Nuestro family focus on the well
-
being and success of our children, and our goal 
is that every child receives the foundation they need to live successful, joyf
ul lives!  We are proud to offer a safe, family
-
focused atmosphere supporting our students' character development as they acquire a top
-
notch education.  To leverage 
best practices, we include the use of modern technology for learning and to support a targ
eted intervention approach 
where each student receives tailored instruction to meet his or her individual needs.  This approach allows advanced 
students to extend their learning as well. In addition to our strong academic program, we offer social/emotional
 
support 
highlighted by ongoing support groups.  When school dismisses, we provide an after
-
school program with homework help 
for students needing a safe place to stay until their parents can be with them.
 
 
Statement
 
The school environment is one in which
 
all students are able to grow and succeed in a safe community atmosphere. 
Parents are important partners in their children's education, and we encourage parental involvement in a variety of ways.  
We all work to support our students and expect the very be
st.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide ass
essments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for Englis
h language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked wit
h the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and t
he California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of the students and staff, a Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan and Handbook has been 
developed and is updated regularly. Some key 
elements are: incident command structure, emergency procedures/action 
plans for specific incidents, quick
-
reference emergency procedures table, and an evacuation diagram.
 
 
A committee is actively engaged in keeping our plan current.  The safety plan was la
st reviewed by the Governing Board 
on Sept. 17, 2019 and was last discussed with faculty during the week of Sept. 23, 2019. However, specific elements of 
the plan have been discussed throughout the school year.  Safety drills, including fire drills and ear
thquake/disaster drills, 
are also regularly conducted at the school.  As part of our safety plan, all visitors must sign in at the office and wear an 
identification tag. The school is fenced and cameras are active 24 hours per day, seven days a week. To en
sure incidents 
are effectively communicated, we also have an emergency tie
-
in with the Sutter County Superintendent's Office and an 
automatic dialing system that can alert parents within minutes.

Nuestro Elementary School has been very successful in meeting the state's expectations regarding its priorities for social, 
behavior, and 
academic outcomes.  Therefore, we have not been identified as needing differentiated support.  As part of 
our successful program, we offer individualized learning support software, tutoring, after school care with homework 
assistance, instructional aides, 
and special education programs to support and assist students.  Based on our needs survey 
that included feedback from parents, students, and staff, we are improving our multi
-
tiered systems of support.  We are 
currently implementing elements of Positive Be
havior Intervention and Support (PBIS).

We see professional development as one key to the continued success of our staff and students.  Staff are highly involved 
in identifying areas of professional development.   
Minimum days are set aside for professional development and 
collaboration.  Teachers, classified staff, and administration participate in off site workshops, seminars, and conferences. 
 
The school also participates in county
-
wide trainings where our teache
rs collaborate with teachers from other small school 
districts to improve our instructional practices.  All teachers are offered opportunities for academic coaching support, and 
teachers who are new to the profession are supported through the Tri
-
County In
duction Program (formerly BTSA).    During 
the 2018
-
19 school year, we focused on improving instructional practices while offering coaching and requested training 
for staff members.  Areas of focus selected through this process for the 2018
-
19 school year 
were using I
-
Ready curriculum, 
multi
-
tiered systems of support, Positive Behavior and Intervention Support, and PBIS for discipline and classroom 
management. In the 2019
-
20 year, we are continuing professional development in these areas while offering coac
hing 
and support for individual staff members.
