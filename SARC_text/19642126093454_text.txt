School Description
 
Patricia Nixon Elementary School has been 
serving students and their families for over 44 years. Located 
in the city of Cerritos, the school hosts the largest elementary school enrollment in the ABC Unified 
School District. Nixon has been recognized by the California Department of Education in 200
4 and again 
in 2008 as a California Distinguished School for its exemplary and quality educational programs.  It is 
because of these exemplary programs that Patricia Nixon Elementary was recognized as one of ABC 
Unified School District's magnet schools.  N
ow referred to as "Nixon Academy" of Multimedia Arts 
Production, the school is celebrating learning through the arts and technology.
 
 
The highly skilled and caring professional staff at Nixon Academy provides a comprehensive educational 
program for all stu
dents in a challenging, safe, and nurturing environment. The faculty and staff works 
in a collaborative spirit to ensure an instructional program that balances basic skills and enrichment. 
Through the arts, the core curriculum at Nixon Academy is enriched 
with opportunities for students to 
develop their full potential and achieve success in school. Visual and performing arts have been an 
essential part of the school's instructional program for the past 22 years.  Students are engaged in 
various forms of art
istic expression: band, vocal music, dance, drama and public speaking.  Through the 
use of multimedia technology, students demonstrate new ways to create, communicate, problem
-
solve 
and collaborate.  Character development is also a school
-
wide focus in whi
ch the staff supports the 
students in becoming responsible and participating citizens in a diverse and ever
-
changing society. 
Setting high expectations, valuing participation, and developing caring relationships are modeled and 
practiced by staff and stude
nts. These tenets have served to maintain the high number of School of 
Choice, Intra
-
district and Inter
-
district permit applications for Nixon Academy.
 
 
The staff and administration at Nixon Academy recognize that the key to successful learning is 
maintain
ing a strong partnership between the home, school and community. The parents at Nixon 

Nixon School Education Foundation, and numerous community volunteer
s work in collaboration with 
the school staff and administration to ensure success for each child. The fund
-
raising efforts supported 
by these volunteers have afforded the students extended and enriched learning opportunities through 
field trips, assemblie
s, state of the art technology and much more.  At Nixon Academy we celebrate 
learning through the arts and technology!
 
 
Nixon Academy is a school community where the highest expectations are maintained. Nixon Academy 
utilizes all available resources to 
enable students to become life
-
long learners who possess the ability to 
achieve their utmost potential. We promote a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment that invites 
students to actively participate in educational opportunities. Nixon Academy prov
ides a welcoming 
atmosphere in which parents and community members are encouraged to become immersed in 
students' educational endeavors. Individual, academic, and social needs of students and staff are met, 
creating a desirable environment where all partic
ipants are successful.  Our shared vision is to better the 
lives of our children through education and to prepare them for their future.
 
 
Nixon's mission is to nurture responsible and creative learners by providing a safe and respectful learning 
environmen
t, with unique experiences in multimedia arts production, engaging all students to be 
compassionate and empowered for the future.  The staff believes student achievement can be attained 
with respect for self and others, responsibility in actions and academ
ics, and promoting a positive school 
climate through kindness and self
-
control. The Nixon staff  promotes and encourages the four core 
values of respect, responsibility, kindness and self
-
control.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school
 
in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educ
ational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionall
y, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
