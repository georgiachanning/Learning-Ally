By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Mission Statement: Jackson Elementary School is to have every student be successful to their best ability. The faculty and 
staff are committed to providing your child with the finest education poss
ible in all areas of curriculum. Our educational 
strategies must meet the individual needs of all students while developing their talents and potentials.
 
 
Instructional Vision Statement: Our Jackson Family is committed to building collaborative partnership
s and a growth 
mindset to implement rigorous curriculum, create innovative real
-
life experiences, and develop opportunities to become 
self
-
reflective in their academic, social, and personal growth resulting in lifelong learning.
 
 
Jackson has a variety of a
cademic, athletic, leadership, and social programs to meet the diverse needs of our population. 
Among our social programs is the "Community of Caring," used to help students adjust to school and create a "safe 
-
friendly" environment. The character traits o
f family, caring, respect, responsibility, and trust are emphasized throughout 
the school and in every classroom. The "Community of Caring" program is coordinated by a classroom teacher and 
supported by a team made up of teachers, parents, and students. "S
econd
-
Step" program is taught in the classroom and 
provides all students with the opportunity to learn social and emotional skills. "Special Friends" and the "Friendship Club" 
are specialized programs that work with our most at
-
risk students. These program
s are facilitated and coordinated by a 
trained para
-
professional. Jackson offers a wide variety of athletic opportunities including football, cross country, 
volleyball, track, basketball, softball, wrestling, and cheerleading. Staff members coach all sport
 
teams. Leadership 
activities include a Student Council made up of officers and classroom representatives. Student Council coordinates school 
activities with an outside private program, "FunWorks."
 
 
To ensure that the needs of all students are met and that
 
we continue to make academic gains, the District and Jackson 
have implemented a variety of instructional strategies, programs, and interventions. The Sanger Unified School District 
has adopted the "Houghton Mifflin Reading Series," a comprehensive languag
e arts program. It also has adopted the 
standards
-
based math program "Houghton Mifflin Mathematics." These programs are the foundation for SUSD standards
-
based curriculum. Teachers are supported by Jackson's Curriculum Support Provider. All Jackson teacher
s make use of 
these programs as their core curriculum. All students have access to these programs, and every student has his/her own 
textbook. Jackson Elementary has purchased the "Accelerated Reader" program as supplemental resources for grades 
Kinder
-
6th
 
as well as the computer based reading program, LEXIA. We open the computer lab daily before school for 
students to have access to these programs and encourage them to use these programs at home for supplemental reading 
practice. This program is a computer
 
curriculum that provides individualized and differentiated instructional support. 
Students are deployed based on their ELPAC scores for ELD instruction. Sanger Unified also uses "Scott Foresman Social 
Studies" for use in classrooms in the area of Social S
tudies. Through grade
-
level PLC meetings, teachers develop their own 
lessons and units to cover the California Academic Content Standards in this content area. Students use our school library 
as a resource for additional information. Student progress in ma
th, reading, language arts, and writing is monitored and 
instruction is adjusted to ensure all students make academic progress towards achieving proficiency levels on District 
Assessments and common formative assessments created by the teachers. Jackson's 
Response to Intervention program 
is available to all students. Students are placed according to need and they are monitored to ensure growth in literacy 
skills. Jackson has one full
-
time Intervention Teacher, an RSP teacher, and a part time RSP Para
-
educat
or to assist in this 
program. Students are referred to the intervention program based on their reading and language performance. Teachers 
are available for support after school for students as well.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensi
ve facilities inspection of every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspections are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD
 
site is inspected by Fresno 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or Williams, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Ins
pection reports 
are maintained at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = 
Good: School maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critical or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: 
School facilities are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this campus are disaggregated below.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Our school strives to 
maintain an active Parent Teacher Organization (PTO).  The Jackson PTO works to support school 
wide and individual classroom activities.  This has often taken the form of support for Red Ribbon Week, a School Carnival, 
Family Fun Nights,  a Family Father/D
aughter Dance, Family Mother/Son Dance, Pastries with Parents, Grandparents Day, 
and Family movie nights.  Our PTO is instrumental in providing "extras" for our school.  We welcome volunteers as general 
help in the office or for specific service in a class
room.  Anyone wishing to become a member of our PTO may obtain an 
application at our Office.  We also have parents serving in elective positions on our School Site Council (SSC) and English 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), which monitor our use of Schoo
l Improvement (SI) funds and other categorical 
funds.    Meetings are held throughout the year and all meetings are open to the public. Jackson School has Parent/Family 
Pride Team Events in which we come together to celebrate successes, work together to fi
nd ways to support our children 
and families with homework, participate in Literacy Nights, and engage in family hands on academic activities. We have 
parent volunteers in the classrooms that supports students in small group additional supports.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Sanger Unified School District Emergency Plans and Procedures are enforced at Jackson School. This is a newly 
implemented District Plan beginning December 2015.  Plans are reviewed with staff annually at the beginning of each 
School Year. Jackson's School 
Site Council (SSC) approves our Safe School Plan.  Emergency drills are conducted to prepare 
students and staff in the event of an emergency.  We strive to maintain a safe, healthy, nurturing, and orderly school 
campus that encourages positive attitudes in
 
students and staff.  A joint effort between students and staff help keep the 
campus clean and litter free.  Site maintenance staff surveys the campus as the first order of business each day.  They 
insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, an
d that the campus is presentable and representative of the 
priority Sanger School Board sets on safety and appearance.    Oversight of Sanger Unified Safe School Plans is through the 
Welfare and Attendance Office.  This site's Safe School Plan was reviewed
 
with site staff in August 2019.

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in reading instruction?
 
 
All of our professional dev
elopment is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have completed 
professional training courses designed to suppo
rt educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which professional development is delivered (e.g., af
ter school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
personalized professional development. Sanger Unified provides 
professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four full days of training dedicated to specific initiatives, 
strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified also offers after
-
school workshops on various 
math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best practices with one another. Teacher leaders at all sites ar
e given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Teachers also have the opportunity to engage in 
personalize
d professional development through instructional coaching.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA) and New Teacher Support. A teacher th
at is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized professional growth. In addition, the teachers attend require
d professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider for two ye
ars. The

teachers, alon
g with their mentors (support providers) attend 4 Network meetings together over the 2 years. In addition, 
the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant request and through surveys 
that include the following: Clas
sroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, 
Meeting the needs of special needs students, Technology, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides 
support and assessment opportunities for all first and sec
ond year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of 
their own professional development, which will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their 
students. The mentors, called support providers, are trained in cognitive c
oaching, working with adult learners, and FACT. 
Support Providers attend a two
-
day training their first year and a one day Refresher every year after. In addition SPs are 
required to attend an orientation, and 2 after school trainings each year to work on 
their mentoring skills.

How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching, teacher
-
principal meetings, student 
performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to have support for all 
teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of support, both at 
the sit
e and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
-
level or content 
colleagues through Professional Learning Communities. In addition, Curriculum Support Providers, Literacy Specialist 
Teachers, (Teachers on 
Special Assignment) and administrators provide on site support. District support is provided at the 
PLC level through collaborative unit/lesson planning and facilitated curriculum curating experiences.
 
 
All of our professional development is based on our s
tudents and teachers needs. Teachers in Sanger Unified have 
completed professional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development 
Days are designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrato
rs, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
Sanger Unified uses Staff Development Days and support from site level Curriculum Support Providers and district level 
District Instructional Specialists to assist teachers in classroom instructional strategies. The 
district provided a strong base 
for Common Core English Language Arts Implementation over the last few years through professional development 
focused on academic vocabulary, content reading and writing, and unpacking standards. This year the district will 
provide 
an extensive Math training on the mathematical practices, math tasks, and academic discourse. Further English Language 
Arts professional development will focus on writing mini lessons and units.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported th
rough the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Program (BTSA). Teachers participating in BTSA receive support from a trained support provider 
for two years. The Sanger BTSA program uses the Formative Assessment 
for California Teachers (FACT) formative 
assessment to guide "new" teachers in their professional growth. The Sanger BTSA program also provides a menu of 
professional development opportunities for BTSA Participating Teachers, Support Providers, and invites
 
all teachers in the 
district to participate, if the topic meets their need. The menu of professional development offerings include the following:
 
Classroom Management, Conducting Parent Teacher Conferences/Parent communication, Meeting the needs of specia
l 
needs students, Technology, UDL, Writing, etc. Sanger Unified's BTSA Induction Program provides support and assessment 
opportunities for all first and second year Participating Teachers to increase understanding of their own professional 
development, whi
ch will enable them to more effectively meet the diverse learning needs of their students.
 
 
In addition to staff development days, teachers participate in workshops and conferences on the following: Literacy 
Strategies, Writing, Reading and Literacy Training, and ongoing SBE textbook adoption in
-
services are provided throughout 
the first 2
-
years 
of a curriculum, text implementation period. In
-
services in Effective Instructional Strategies, Professional 
Learning Communities, and strategies for English Learners are also provided.
