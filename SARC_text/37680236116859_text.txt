School Description
 
Arroyo Vista Charter School (AVCS) opened in July 1999 serving a K
-
6 population.   Arroyo Vista is 
one of 46  elementary schools and 3 independent charters in the Chula Vista Elementary School 
District.  There are seven permanent pods and 12 and a half rel
ocatable classrooms on the Arroyo 
Vista campus. Arroyo Vista serves students from Transitional Kindergarten through eighth grade.
 
 
Arroyo Vista's  K
-
6 Spanish
-
English Dual Language Immersion Program was designed as a 90/10 
Dual Immersion Model.  This 
model was selected  to provide students with optimal opportunities 
to become bilingual and biliterate.  A lottery process is used to select students for the program and 
half of the students are English Only and half are bilingual Spanish/English.  The bili
ngual students 
serve as role models in Spanish.
 
 
Beginning in July 2011, Arroyo Vista expanded to include a Middle School.  Students hailing from 
22 different elementary sites enroll in Arroyo Vista's middle school each year.  These students 
scored excepti
onally well  on the CAASPP assessment.  In 2017 96% of seventh graders either met 
or exceeded  in English Language Arts and 89% either met or exceeded in Math.  In Eighth grade  
88% either met or exceeded in ELA and 85% either met or exceeded in Math. Midd
le school 
students have a choice of varied electives, such as, Archery, Kitchen Science, Photography, 
Robotics, Yearbook and Sign Language.
 
 
Our school
-
wide goal for the year 2017/18 is to implement Common Core State Standards (CCSS) 
across all areas of th
e curriculum with a special emphasis on Math and to ensure that  assessment 
practices match the Smarter Balance Assessment. Professional development for staff this year 
placed emphasis on Technology in the classroom, Mathematical Practices and closing the 
achievement gap for English Learners, Students with Disabilities and Socio
-
economically 
Disadvantaged Students.  The CAASPP Assessment was administered in spring of 2017 to students 
in grades third through sixth. These students did exceedingly well.  In gr
ades 3 through 6, 75% either 
met or exceeded in ELA and 65% either met or exceeded in Math.
 
 
Local Measures Assessment was given to Kindergarten through second grade students at the end 
of the school year.  In kindergarten, 66% met in Reading; 67% met in W
riting and 96% met in Math.  
In First grade 84% met in Reading; 67% met in Writing and 85% met in Math.  In second grade, 89% 
met in writing and 87% met in Math.  Reading has a different assessment.
 
 
Mission
 
Arroyo Vista Charter School is a central compone
nt in the EastLake community where it is located.  
The goal of staff and parents is to create lifelong learners and to have ALL students acquire the

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by s
tate 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are req
uired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For 
more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact 
the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
AVCS is in its nineteenth year of existence and is well maintained. The initial classroom space at AVCS was adequate to suppo

when it opened.  Playground space accommodated bo
th primary and upper grade recess schedules.  When the middle school was added, a 
basketball/volleyball court was created for middle school students to participate in after school sports activities. Addition
al courts have been added to 
provide adequate spa
ce to provide a comprehensive physical education program for the Middle School students on a daily basis.
 
 
The District maintained a planned program, which ensured routine maintenance functions were performed on a scheduled basis an
d that the custodial 
sta
ff performed basic cleaning operations daily and maintained a graffiti
-
free site.
 
 
An after
-
school DASH program provides orchestrated games, activities and special events that keep students actively engaged in a super
vised, safe 
environment after dismissal
.  This program is provided through a partnership between the Chula Vista Elementary School District and the YMCA. There 
is also a YMCA program for after school childcare.
 
 
Visitors are required to check
-
in at the school office using the Raptor system when
 
entering the campus and visitor badges are issued to ensure security. 
The school is completely enclosed with security fencing.  Classroom doors and the front doors of the Media Center and Multi

School Picnic
, Father/Daughter and 
Mother/Son dances, Spring Festival and Art Show/Ice Cream Social.  Parents also serve on the T.E.A.M. Council, our governing 
board; are invited to serve 
on our school committees, which include  English Language Acquisition Committee (
ELAC) and the Safe School Committee.  AVCS' ELAC meets regularly 
to facilitate communication among parents, not only within our school, but also within the larger community.  AVCS has one of
 
the highest PTA 
membership in the school district with over 500 m
embers.
 
 
Parents continue to provide support to our GATE students by working with  teacher advisors weekly during Inquiring Minds, a b
efore
-
school program for 
GATE students from 4th through 8th grades..  Parents have attended training on Cyberbullying and 
Common Core Math State Standards. Parent/Guardian 
voice is an integral part of our LCAP process.  Parents/Guardians have an opportunity to provide input through surveys and by
 
attending community 
forums.

School Safety Plan
 
Arroyo Vista Charter School seeks to enhance school safety th
rough a variety of strategies that focus on the people and the programs of our school. 
Arroyo Vista Charter School's Safe School Committee monitors and measures progress towards annual goals that evolve from staf
f, student and parent 
input. There are two m
ajor components within our plan, Creating a Positive School Climate and the Physical Environment. Within these components all
 
areas that impact the safety of students and staff are addressed. Some of these include: Character and Citizenship Developmen
t, Re
storative Practices, 
Student Aspiration Surveys, Youth Mental Health First Aid, Monitoring of Attendance, Safe Egress/Ingress from parking areas a
nd Security Procedures.   
We continue our implementation of the 'Be Kind' program that was started at Arroyo V
ista in 2012. Our plan also includes monthly safety drill procedures. 
Our school's code of mutual respect, no put
-
downs and responsible decision
-
making is used to measure student progress in the areas of diversity and 
safety. Progress was reflected by a re
duced number of racial, physical and verbal conflicts as evidenced by fewer referrals to the site administrators.  
Arroyo Vista's School Safety Plan was reviewed, discussed with staff and updated in September, 2018.  The Comprehensive Safe 
School Plan was 
approved 
by TEAM Council, the charter's governing board in October 2018.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
For the past three years, school
-
wide data from standardized assessments, classroom assessments and local measures were used to design and 
implement targeted, school
-
wide professional development for teachers, instructional assistants and other employees. 
 
AVCS has committed to providing 
systemic professional development. Most training is done on
-
site by consultants, staff and administrators so that a common understanding is developed 
among all staff.  The areas of professional development reflect the schoo

Reading Comprehension and Conceptual Math understanding.  It  is designed to ensure best instructional practices in every cla
ssroom.  Teachers 
participate in weekly professio
nal development focused in the aforementioned areas. The  Gradual Release of Responsibility model is used as a vehicle 
to deliver instruction.  Beginning in 2016/17, Arroyo Vista's Professional Development also focused on Social/Emotional Devel
opment of st
udents.  Staff 
was trained in Restorative Practices and Student Aspirations to foster community and connectedness with students.
 
 
Every teacher has his/her CLAD certification or equivalent and eight teachers have BCLAD certification.  Professional develop
m
ent in implementing the 
Common Core State Standards, writing, developing conceptual understanding in Math and in utilizing the Close Reading strategy
 
to deepen meaning 
began in the 2012/2013 school year and continues to be provided during staff meetings, c
ollaboration sessions and professional development days.  An 
academic coach to support the implementation of Common Core State Standards was added to the staff in March, 2013.
 
 
The Instructional Leadership Team participated in a cohort with six other schoo
ls and received training in the areas of High Impact Language Strategies, 
Visible Learning, Conceptual Mathematics, and Social Emotional Learning. They, in turn, presented a similar training to the A
rroyo Vista staff during 
Professional Development days an
d weekly staff meetings.

Types of Services Funded
 
AVCS utilizes its Title I and LCAP funding to hire eight part
-
time teachers to work with our Title I students.  One teacher works with small groups of not 
more than four students in every first through sixth grade classroom.  Two teachers service Kindergar
ten classrooms.  This program enables our students 
that qualify for Title I support to meet twice daily in small groups in the area of English Language Arts.  Each day, these s
tudents meet once with the 
classroom teacher and once with the Title I teacher i
n small groups.  Students receiving this extra support showed academic growth on Local Measures 
and CAASPP assessments. GATE students in grades 4th through 8th are given the opportunity to meet one day a week before schoo
l for one hour to 
participate in th
e Inquiring Minds program. Teachers facilitate these groups and engage both students and their parents in thought provoking a
ctivities 
and projects.
 
 
Students that scored below basic and far below basic on the CAASPP were given the opportunity to participa
te in our before school Extended Day 
program.  These classes were taught by highly qualified teachers and were limited to between 7 and 9 students each.  The resu
lts indicated that 
participating students improved their scores on the CAASPP in ELA and Mathe
matics.  Students in kindergarten, first and second grade that did not 
demonstrate proficiency on the Local Measures assessment received extra support through the Jump Start program that was offer
ed three days a week 
before school for 12 weeks.
 
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data too
l located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/

DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at 
public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Interne
