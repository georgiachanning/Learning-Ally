About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

Parent Workshops and Family NIghts
 
 
The School Site Council, consisting of school staff, parents, and community members, is a major governing body that meets reg
ularly to
 
address programs 
and components that make up the school plan, to discuss the effectiveness of our programs for student achievement, and to act
 
as a liaison between the 
community and the school.
 
 
We understand the link between the home and school is essent
ial and we appreciate the parental support we receive through School Site Council, PTA, 
and the Parent Volunteer Program. Parents are encouraged to attend monthly PTA meetings and are kept informed through the sch
ool website, PeachJar, 
emails, Facebook pag
e and Twitter page.
