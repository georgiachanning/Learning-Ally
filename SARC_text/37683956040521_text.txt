By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Oneonta's 
enrollment is at student capacity. Security is bolstered by the presence of a security resident who lives on the 
property and inspects the property during nights and weekends to prevent vandalism and theft. In addition, surveillance 
cameras are located thr
oughout the campus.
 
 
District Maintenance and Custodial staff take great care in ensuring that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Lawns 
are mowed on Saturdays in an effort to minimize any classroom disturbances. Cleaning schedules are developed b
y the 
Principal and the Facilities Director to guarantee daily cleaning of campus. Restroom facilities are inspected three times a 
day by the Head Custodian to ensure they are fully stocked and in full working order. Any needed repairs are addressed 
in a t
imely manner. Copies of inspections are available at the school and facilities offices.
 
 
The Head Custodian also performs a safety inspection on a monthly basis. The monthly report is submitted to the facilities 
office. Regular and preventative maintenance
 
is ongoing. The district employs a computerized online work order system 
for efficiency and better record keeping.
 
 
As per Education Code, the district is required to include in this document, a description of any needed maintenance to 
ensure good repair 
as specified in statute. "Good Repair" means the facility is maintained in a manner that assures that it 
is clean, safe, and functional as determined pursuant to a Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of 
California Office of Public Schoo
l Construction (OPSC). The FIT will evaluate the conditions at a school site with ratings of 
"good," "fair," or "poor." The FIT also provides an overall summary of the conditions at each school on a scale of 
"exemplary," "good," "fair," or "poor." The inst
rument shall not require capital enhancements beyond the standards to 
which the facility was designed and constructed.
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
Oneonta Elementary was built in 1959. The following
 
table displays the results of the most recently completed school site 
inspection to determine the school facility's good repair status.
 
 
OVERALL SUMMARY OF SCHOOL FACILITY GOOD REPAIR STATUS
 
At the time of the above inspection on October 31, 2019, the ave
rage ranking for Oneonta Elementary was 96.90%, giving 
the school a rating of "Good." The rating is determined by the average of the 15 categories addressed above. Below are 
the percentages, descriptions, and ratings, as per the Facilities Inspection Tool 
(FIT).
 
 
Please note that all needed repairs or deficiencies identified in the October FIT report have been completed and/or

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Oneonta Elementary School, we 
believe that parent and community engagement supports student achievement. 
Families are important partners in our school community. We engage these stakeholders in through opportunities for 
face
-
to
-
face involvement and connection, via our PTA, ELAC, School
 
Site Council meetings, as well as through our 
bimonthly Coffee with the Principal. Additionally, we maintain a Community Volunteer Coordinator (CVC), who works to 
recruit and train parent and community volunteers and provides site and community resources 
to support at
-
risk families 
and schedules. Our CVC organizes parent workshops. Other opportunities for parent and community involvement include 
school events, such as our annual "Leadership Day" showcase and awards ceremonies, as well as through grade and 
classroom

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a priority at Oneonta Elementary School. To support clear and efficient systems, the South Bay Union 
School District developed a Crisis Response Box for each of its school sites.
 
Each box contains a comprehensive Emergency 
Procedural Guidelines binder specific to each site. The binder includes state required disaster procedures such as, but not 
limited to, bomb threat, earthquake, fire, medical emergency, missing student, and shoo
tings. Evacuation maps, 
evacuation sites, key phone numbers, district/site communication plans are just a few of the elements included within the 
plan. School staff review the Safety Plan and procedures annually, most recently on November 6, 2019. Key proc
edures 
and information are also shared with students. Additionally, our school conducts various types of drills on a regular basis 
throughout the year and record the exercise on an Emergency Drills Record form.

At Oneonta, we offer on
-
site professional development through our weekly 
afterschool sessions on minimum days, which 
allow for additional time for staff to reflect and grow. In the 2018
-
2019 and 2019
-
2020 school years, the overarching focus 
to our professional development time was using evidence of learning to inform our instru
ctional practice. This focus was 
chosen due to the significant opportunities to increase student achievement demonstrated in both our internal data and 
CAASPP performance across both English Language Arts and Math. Due the the fundamental importance of lit
eracy in 
performance on both language and math assessments, our primary emphasis was on evidence of learning in literacy, with 
as secondary focus on math achievement data.
 
 
Typically, two minimum day sessions per month are designated for staff development.
 
 
One of these minimum days each month is structured as a whole
-
school professional learning community (PLC), where 
we engage with evidence of student learning to identify action steps for both teachers and students to grow in their 
practice. In the 2018
-
2
019 school year, all classroom teachers participated in eight (8) hour
-
long administratively
-
directed 
PLCs in which they examined student level data to determine instructional next steps. Data sources included on
-
demand 
writing, math benchmark testing, and
 
Fountas + Pinnell reading data. The focus of this work was to use data to guide 
instruction in all academic areas. Examples of this focus include using a "thin slice" protocol in grade level teams to ident
ify 
and target supports for students in writing, o
r looking at Fountas and Pinnell reading data to plan for small group 
instruction. In the 2019
-
2020 school year, in these PLCs teachers examined student level data to determine instructional 
next steps in mathematics instruction. This academic focus was ch
osen to address gaps in achievement at our school site 
in this academic area.
 
 
The second of these afterschool professional development opportunities is through our monthly staff meetings, which are 
typically dedicated to staff learning and inquiry around 
academics and leadership.  In staff meetings, examples of 
professional learning focused on data
-
informed teaching include analyzing classroom
-
level ELPAC data and learning about 
strategies to support students at each language
-
ability level and reviewing ma
th benchmark data to target student 
instruction. In the 2019
-
2020 school year, staff meeting professional development is largely focused on developing our 
instructional practice in literacy, specifically looking at how we might use conferring, small
-
group 
work, and productive 
student engagement to enhance student learning and achievement in reading. In both years, we also dedicated staff 
meeting time to implementation of the Leader in Me program, which is a CASEL
-
endorsed program to support student 
success,
 
based on Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
 
 
The other two minimum days each month are used by teacher teams to meet in smaller PLCs, in which teachers engage 
with their colleagues to study student work and data to determine action s
teps and instructional plans.
 
 
In South Bay Union School District, all teachers participate in two days of professional development prior to the start of 
the school year. In the 2018
-



for the school year. In the 2019
-

and 
examining school
-
level data to set goals for the year. The second day focused on powerful first instruction in reading, 
writing, math, and leadership.
 
 
Additionally, all classroom teachers received regular classroom visits and feedback from the principal. 
In the 2018
-
2019 
school year, eight teachers participated in the IPLS evaluation system, which included 16 classroom observations and 4 
meetings to discuss goals and progress with the principal. In the 2010
-
2020 school year, ten teachers are participating 
in 
the IPLS evaluation system, which includes a minimum of 16 classroom observations and 4 meetings to discuss goals and 
progress with the principal.

Noontime supervisors participated in bi

monthly meetings/professional development with the principal to improve 
systems of safety and positive behavioral support fo
r students during the lunch hour.
 
 
Staff development is provided by the principal, district Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs), Leader in Me "Lighthouse 
Team," and our English Learning Committee. In addition, teachers have the opportunity to attend dis
trict professional 
development during their break/vacation time throughout the school year. Teachers are supported through feedback and 
coaching from the principal as well as from TOSAs, when requested.
