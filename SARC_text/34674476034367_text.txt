By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Welcome to Arlington Heights Elementary!
 
Our school 
staff, students and parents collaborate to provide a community of learning based on critical thinking and 
challenging each and every student as they meet their greatest potential.  The mission of Arlington Heights Elementary 
School created collaboratively 
with staff, parents, and community is as follows:  Through collaboration within our learning 
community, the mission of Arlington Heights Elementary School is to ensure each student finds success in building a strong, 
innovative academic foundation through 
challenging and collaborative instruction focused on Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (i.e., STEAM) and the application of 21st Century Learning Skills to inspire passionate 
life long learners.
 
 
SCHOOL PROFILE
 
Arlington Heights Eleme
ntary is one of 41 elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District. The 340 students 
attending Arlington Heights are 59.24% white, 22.61% Hispanic/Latino, 5.1% African American, and 13.05% other 
ethnicities. Thirty
-
two of our students are Englis
h language learners, with Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian being the 
predominate languages, and 65.29% of students are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Additionally, 6.67% are receiving 
special education services.
 
 
The curriculum provided is being supplement
ed with additional materials and professional development of teachers as 
we continue to align to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The school supports cultural awareness on a daily basis 
through its diverse literature selections and other school acti

needs of its students and the surrounding community.
 
 
Community Building Assembly 
-
 
Mustang Rally
 
Monthly, we hold an all school assembly to focus on positive awards for citizenship, 
character education, classroom 
recognition and school spirit. During the assembly, students who have excelled in academic, citizenship, attendance and 
school spirit are recognized with our school's lanyard and charm system. On a weekly basis, students earn
 
"Arli Caught 
Ya's" slips for demonstrating positive school expectations and are entered in a drawing for prizes. In the beginning of the 
year, we will teach school
-
wide expectations for recess rules and procedures.
 
 
Critical Thinking and STEAM Initiatives
 
Since 2013, Arlington Heights Elementary has used the Seminars in Critical Literacy as its approach to literature and 
writing. It frames our thinking as our learning community approaches literature and the world through conceptual lenses. 
In Fall 2016, Ar
lington Heights Elementary School began the process of incorporating the STEAM  approach to learning.  In 
Fall 2017, the STEAM approach was fully adopted, thus making Arlington the district's first PLTW (i.e., Project Lead the 
Way) elementary school . This
 
has enhanced teaching
-
learning through an interdisciplinary, applied, and project
-
based 
approach in order to better prepare our students for Next Generation Science Standards and 21st century learning overall.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September, 2019
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the Sta
te of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials ar
e adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the
 
School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qu
ality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials please visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page
/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials available for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Arlington Heights Elementary School completed a major modernization during the 1999
-
2000 school year.  Currently, 
there is sufficient space to hou
se the student population. There is site custodial staff that cleans the building, along with 
district support for major/minor repairs. The district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. 
Regular fire/emergency drills are held and
 
badges are required for all visitors and personnel. During the summer of 2010 
a large landscape and irrigation project was completed through Measure J. Work included repair, seal and stripe of the 
front parking lot, hard court and fire lane; expansion of 
drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas; new compliant loading zone and paths 
to the site. The irrigation system was upgraded to fully automatic operation.  New trees and low maintenance landscaping 
was installed and a new concrete plaza area was formed in front of the
 
school. In addition, in fall 2017 a new Early 
Childhood Education/Kindergarten playground was installed with soft material borders, expanded play structures and a 
permanent shade canopy protecting the majority of the playground along with a STEAM Initiati
ve Maker Space.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activit
ies and preserve the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in October 2019 and 
determined that there were no u
nsafe conditions that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Boar
d's standards for custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's ma
intenance department. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air condit
ioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets $2 million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades th
ree 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the mo
st significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education seq
uences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Classroom Practices, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and Engageme
nt through Reading and Writing, Expository Reading and Writing 
Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-
funded projects, and the San Juan 

ional development opportunities are voluntary 
for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during the school day, after school, on 
Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and administrators also take ad
vantage of 
opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, the college/university 
programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds the professional development
 
in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, and (c) district
-
identified g
oals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional development in district focus 
areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center for Teacher Support.
