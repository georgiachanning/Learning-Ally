By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with 
data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members
 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates,
 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Superintendent's Message
 
The annual report card to
 
our parents and community, known as the School Accountability Report Card was established 
by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in November 1988.  the report is to be issued annually by the 
local school board for each elementary and
 
secondary school in the state.  It provides for the parents, the community , 
and the public a variety of information about the local school, its resources, its successes and the areas in which 
improvement is needed.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
Pond Union School Di
strict will provide each student the opportunity to develop intellectually, emotionally, physically, and 
socially in a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
The Pond Union School District will provide a quality education, providing the basis for 
students to become life
-
long 
learners as well as moral, ethical and compassionate people.  A partnership of staff, students, parents, and the community 
will prepare students to become responsible citizens and productive members of the  communities in which
 
they live.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Campus Maintenance
 
Pond Elementary School follows a structured
 
maintenance program to ensure that all
 
classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and
 
in good repair. Two full
-
time d
ay custodians are
 
responsible for routine maintenance, daily
 
custodial 
duties, and special events preparation.
 
The superintendent/principal communicates daily
 
with the custodians to discuss 
safety issues,
 
custodial responsibilities, housekeeping needs,
 
and
 
maintenance schedules. The custodians
 
follow specific 
cleaning standards, schedules,
 
and policies for maintaining clean, safe
 
environments for everyone on campus. The
 
school 
custodian is qualified and equipped to
 
handle minor repairs and maintenance proje
cts.
 
School staff communicate 
unscheduled
 
maintenance requests and special projects to the
 
custodian through a work order system. Larger
 
projects 
requiring third party contractors are
 
coordinated by the superintendent/principal. All
 
staff work 
together to resolve urgent 
situations
 
immediately.
 
 
Before students arrive on campus, the
 
maintenance department inspects the campus
 
for any unsafe conditions that need 
to be
 
addressed before instruction begins. On a daily
 
basis, the day custodians clean th
e restrooms
,
 
cafeteria, and school 
grounds. Restrooms are
 
checked throughout the day as a proactive
 
measure in keeping facilities safe, sanitary, and
 
stocked. The custodians are responsible
 
for comprehensive cleaning of classroom
, office
 
areas, and 
restrooms. The 
custodians are
 
capable of fulfilling basic custodial needs for
 

 
custodians 
receive training regularly from supply
 
vendors on proper use of chemicals, equipment,
 
pest control, and cleaning practices
. 
Custodians
 
attend regularly scheduled meetings and
 
workshops sponsored by the Kern County Superintendent
 
of Schools.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Pond Union Elementary School District
 
Deferred maintenance projects are budgeted yearly.  These typically
 
include 
ro
ofing, plumbing, heating, air
 
conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior
 
painting, and floor systems. Since 2016  
Prop 39 funds have  utilized
 
to replace all inside and outside lighting
 
fixtures with brighter energy efficient fixtures, 
replace 
al HVAC units with updated
 
energy efficient units, thermostats have been replaced as well.
 
A solar array system is being 
reviewed for purchase and installation in 2019..

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent 
Involvement
 
 
Parents are encouraged to get involved in their
 

 
events, serving on a 
school committee, and helping
 
out on campus. Teachers welcome assistance in the
 
classroom and chaperones for field 
trips.
 
Parents
 
are invited to attend the Latino Family Literacy
 
Project or Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE) 
which 
meets 6
-
10 times per year to teach parents
 
strategies they can use to assist and support their
 
children to be 
successful at 
Pond School.
 
Parents who wish to take an active role in the education 
process are invited to join the School Safety
 
Committee, School Site Council, English Language
 
Advisory Council (ELAC), and the Pond Parent Teacher
 
Association (PTA).
 
The Site Council is responsible
 
for monitoring the school budget and preparation/
approval of the school site safety plan 
and 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and School Wellness Plan. 
As a result of parent support and
 
concerted efforts, 
students
 
benefit from extra field trips.
 
The Annual Fall Carnival is held in October. More than
 
50 local businesses and 
community service
 
organizations donate a significant amount of
 
discounts on merchandise and services. This fund raiser 
provides supports for team sports, student activities and
 
parent education opportunities.
 
 
Many school events throughout the year provide
 

 
academic experience
