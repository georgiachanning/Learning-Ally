influences, and tell an adult when they encounter diffi
cult situations.
 
 

Additionally, a partnership with Project
 
Cornerstone has been forged, which promotes research
-
based developmental assets as a guiding framework for the support and healthy development of 
all children. In addition to Project Cornerstone, students are provided with opportunities to learn 
self empo
werment through practice based assemblies with the support of Soul Shoppe.  Most 
recently, Dove HIll has adopted and begun the implementation of Problems Based Intervention 
Strategies (PBIS).  PBIS works simultaneously alongside Discipline with Dignity, So

Project Cornerstone.  Our focus remains safety, respect, and responsibility which is the basis for all 
of our school rules.  Our mission as we begin the implementation of this national research based 
practice is to teach and reward good behav

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school
 
in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educ
ational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionall
y, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.c
de.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
commu
nity members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School 
District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient and go
od quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students,
 
including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must
 
be aligned with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays 
information collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual an
d Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science m
aterials at its November 2017 public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Dove Hill Elementary School, originally constructed in 1988, is currently 
comprised of 24 permanent classrooms, 14 portable classrooms, a computer lab, 
a library, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a staff lounge, a parent resource room, and two playgrounds. One is for our transit
ional kindergarten and 
kindergarten students.  The ot
her playground is for grades 1
-

kitchen walls have been re
-
paneled, cafeteria benches have been replaced, and all circuits, wiring, and Internet connections have be
en upgraded.  In 
August of 2015, the roofs were updated and repaired.  In August 2018, the staff restrooms were remodeled and our student heal
th office bathroom was 
remodeled and updated.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Dove Hill Elementary School provides a safe and c
lean environment for students, staff, and volunteers.  The district has adopted cleaning standards for 
all schools in the district.  Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphas
is on classrooms and 
restroo
ms.  A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Mainte
nance & Repair:
 

vy maintenance functions 
occurring during vacation periods.  Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is admin
istered by Evergreen School District to ensure that school 
grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate atte
ntion.  Emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority; repair request
s are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
fo
r major repair or replacement of existing school building components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, a
ir conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.  In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State L
egislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility.  The district wi
ll utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repair.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to pr

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences and workshops throughout the year.  For
 
the past three years, the 
district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad
-
based va
riety of professional growth opportunities in 
curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that sup
ports implementation of 
Common Core State Standards at site staff development days.  
At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) 
to it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK
-
3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance 
our reading and w
riting program.  Additionally, Dove Hill utilizes materials from Literature Connections and SNAP designed to enhance and impr
ove  the 
teaching of reading and writing with the support of individual and grade level coaching.  As a staff, we are committed to 
the successful implementation 
of PBIS and continue to receive professional development for the continued successful implementation.
