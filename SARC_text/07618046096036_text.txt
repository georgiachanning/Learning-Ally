School Description
 
Greenbrook Elementary School is nestled amongst a tree
-
lined greenbelt and 
sits beneath the 
rolling hills of the San Ramon Valley. In 2006, Greenbrook was torn down and rebuilt from a 1970 
pod style school into modern campus featuring 28 classrooms, a separate library, and large 
kindergarten wing. We average 600 
-
 
650 students pe
r year with an additional 35 preschool 
students, 42 teachers, and approximately 25 classified personnel. Though we are named 
Greenbrook, our school mascot is the bald eagle and our colors are red, white, and blue as the 
school was established in 1976, the 
United States Bicentennial. Greenbrook has an engaged parent 
community and volunteers including an active PTA and supportive education foundation. As a staff, 
we place emphasis on character development and social/emotional learning competencies. Our 
school
-
wide goals include student safety, increasing consistent student attendance and student 
connection to school/staff, and focused strategies on meeting the differentiated learning needs of 
all students.
 
 
Rhea Murphy, Principal
 
rmurphy@srvusd.net
 
 
Mission St
atement:
 
Greenbrook Elementary School nurtures a positive community environment 
where all students gain core skills and tools vital to become self
-
reliant, life
-
long learners and 
healthy, independent young people.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority
: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

calculated by taking the 
total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priorit
y: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents, students, and 
teachers share in the responsibility for student learning and well
-
being at Greenbrook School. Parents are actively involved at 
Greenbrook through many avenues and opportunities. Parent volunteers, representing over 50% of the families, help in innumera
ble
 
ways, both in and 
out of the classroom. The PTA provides opportunities for family social events, such as movie nights, inclusive dances, and a 
multi
-
cultural evening 
(Greenbrook Goes Global) as well as educational activities, such as the Science Explorati
on and Math Game Nights. The Education Foundation (EAGLE), 
raises significant funds to enrich the school programs by purchasing supplies and equipment (technology & play structure), su
pporting teacher 
professional development, and funding personnel, such a
s the library/media coordinator, music, art, reading intervention support, and classroom 
paraeducators. The School Site Council develops and oversees the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and the School Climate and Emergency plans. 
The Council consistent
ly reviews student and climate data throughout the year to determine areas for improvement as well as to prioritize school fu
nds 
in order to meet student needs. Parent volunteers are actively involved on the Greenbrook campus throughout the school day 
-
 
-
 
there are opportunities 
to volunteer in the classrooms and at lunch recess as a noon duty supervisor as well as opportunities to drive and chaperon f
ield trips and provide 
assistance with other school activities (ie, vision/hearing screening, school pictur
e day, etc.).

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University
 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experie
nces are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team 
and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, in
tentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These co
horts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teache
rs are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our
 
Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the di
strict as a whole is enhanced.
