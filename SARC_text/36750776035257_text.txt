School Description
 
Rancho Verde 
Elementary school is a PreK
-
6 campus that services our neighborhood students and 
a small portion of students from other schools within the district who are overflowed.  Rancho 
Verde provides services to students with special needs and identified English La
nguage Learners.  
As a Professional Learning Community (PLC), we value weekly opportunities to collaborate with our 
colleagues to apply best instructional practices in the classroom, plan lessons and assess student 
learning. Curriculum such as Orton
-
Gillin
gham (Phonics), McGraw Hill, Benchmark (English 
Language Arts), Fountas and Pinnell (Guided Reading), Units of Study (Writing) and Go Math! 
(Math) with Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) strategies allows for a more interactive approach 
with hands
-
on lea
rning and technology in the classroom.  One of our site goals is that all students 
exiting 3rd grade are reading at or above the 3rd grade level.  Outside of regular school hours, 
students are supported with tutoring and After School Education & Safety (AS
ES) programs.
 
 
Rancho Verde students (Grades 1
-
6) participate in 200 minutes of physical education every 10 
school days, as required by law.  By law (California Education Code Section 60800), all public local 
educational agencies in California are required
 
to administer the Physical Fitness Test (PFT) to all 
students in fifth grade.  The PFT was last administered to our students in Spring of 2018.  The PFT 
assesses each students' level of health
-
related fitness.  Each teacher designs the curriculum for 
thei

they receive a report stating the results of their student's test. This allows teachers, parents, and 
guardians to monitor changes in the student's fitness leve
ls.
 
 
Within our new efforts at Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), our school motto is 
"Rancho Verde RoadRunnerS are Respectful, Responsible and Safe!"  Our staff has created sitewide 
expectations of behavior as well as grade level classro
om expectations.  Lessons are taught and 
reviewed with the students to reinforce the positive behaviors.  Students are identified and 
rewarded for the good behaviors they exhibit on a daily basis.  Our Student of the Day participates 
in the morning message
 
to the school and qualifies to be chosen as a Student of the Month.  We 
use Character Counts! as a positive behavior intervention curriculum that focuses on 6 pillars of 
character traits we want everyone to exhibit: Trustworthiness, Respectfulness, Respon
sibility, 
Fairness, Caring and Citizenship.  We believe and teach that it is important to be TRRFCC (sounds

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
"Effective with the October 2017 Facility Inspection, Apple Valley Unified School District determined to hire a third party 
independent consultant to 
inspect the facilities of the District and complete the annual Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) Reports.  This procedure has es
tablished consistent inspection 
methodologies and reporting procedures on our annual FIT Reports."
 
 
Ranch
o Verde consists of 23 permanent classrooms, a permanent cafeteria (constructed between 1967 and 1969), 19 re
-
locatable classrooms and a main 
office.  Classrooms are also used for our After School Education & Safety (ASES) and tutoring programs.  The schoo
l is deep cleaned every night with 
maintenance/cleaning occurring throughout the day.  A safety inspection of the campus is conducted daily by the lead custodia
n before teachers and 
students arrive.   Rancho Verde is inspected by the plant supervisor and a
dministrator regularly to ensure that the campus is clean, safe, and functional 
for our staff and students. Restrooms are checked periodically throughout each school day to ensure cleanliness and functiona
lity.  Site custodians follow 
set procedures daily 
to ensure that a clean and safe environment is maintained.  Minor repairs are performed by site custodial staff.  Major repai
rs are 
reported through an online system for district personnel to fix.
 
 
An annual facilities inspection, using the state
-
adopted F
acilities Inspection Tool, is conducted to ensure that the campus is in good repair.  District 
maintenance personnel evaluate the facility throughout the year, make necessary repairs, and plan long
-
term projects with the site administrator.  In 
the 2019 FI
T report, the Rancho Verde campus received an overall score of "fair".  The Interior Surfaces (ceiling tiles) was the area th
at needed the most 
attention.  The most recent site inspection was completed during the week of 10/14 
-
 
10/18 of 2019.
 
 
The campus 
has undergone modernization during the 2004
-
2005 school year and received additional upgrades funded by the district bond passage.  All 
state mandated improvements have been completed and a new kindergarten facility was completed seven years ago.

Most of the deficiencies in this system are

replaced mainly by site 
personnel.  
District Maintenance & Operations (M&O) 
personnel will supply the tiles and repair 
roofs to prevent leaks that cause water 
stains.  All but two carpet concerns were 
corrected by M&O last year.  We have a 
new tear in one carpet, which has been

have a stain on a carpet that is unable to 
be removed but does not effect the safety

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by th
e total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to pr
otect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level p
ercentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the 
school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
This has been an area of focus for our school.  Currently (2019
-
20), we have a group o
f very dedicated parents who serve our students as approved 
volunteers through our Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)/District English Learner Advisory Committee 
(DELAC), School Site Council (SSC), District Advisor
y Committee (DAC) and as classroom aides or field trip chaperones.  We regularly thank each of these 
parents for their support but also prepare a special "Thank You" recognition event where staff get to honor those volunteers 
for their time/energy.
 
 
Over t
he next year, the principal and staff will work at improving the level of parent involvement within our school.  A portion of
 
school funds is allocated 
to pay the costs of fingerprinting for our parents.  Free TB testing is (at times) able to be offered to
 
our parents in conjunction with our Family Outreach 
program and affiliations with Granite Hills High School and Heritage
-
 
Victor Valley Medical Group.  These combined efforts create a situation where 
becoming an approved volunteer can be a no cost process
.  Efforts are being made to create a warm and inviting atmosphere for all of our parents, 
including offering translation and/or childcare, where appropriate.  Activities (such as Fall Festival, Literature Night, STE
M Night) throughout the year will 
allow 
parents and students to build a strong connection to their school as they attend and create memories.
 
 
New this year, Parents Matter is a program of workshops offered to our parents.  Parents are invited to attend 25 minute work
shops on scheduled nights 
th
at provide information on Aeries gradebook/Parent portal, counseling resources, homework support, etc.  Food , translation an
d childcare are provided 
to encourage families to attend.  A recognition certificate will be provided to those who attend
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SA
RC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.

School Safety Plan
 
Rancho Verde developed its 
School Safety Plan over a decade ago, and with the support of the site Safety Committee and School Site Council, updates 
and approves the body of the document annually.  In 2016, the district provided a template to promote consistency within all 
schools an
d Rancho Verde 
adopted the use of that template for its Safety Plan.
 
 
The site Safety Plan encompasses not only school safety issues, but the campus' Disaster Plan and the procedures and assignme
nts associated with that 
document.  Some of the topics covere
d in the plan include: the assessment of current crime status on campus (as provided by school police), a list of 
positive programs available which promote school safety, child abuse reporting procedures, the school Dress Code and discipli
ne rules, and all
 
of the 
information regarding disaster drill procedures and staff assignments.  Staff members are provided a copy of the annually rev
ised Safety Plan  Lock down, 
fire, and earthquake drills are performed throughout the year.  These are scheduled within the
 
site but also reported to the district via a Google Calendar 
we use internally to maintain a record of such drills.

In the Apple 
Valley Unified School District, Professional Development (PD) occurs at the site level as well as in conjunction with the dis
trict office.
 
 
The district provides support for particular instructional strategies.  Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) is a go
od example of this district supported PD.  
CGI follows a constructivist model of math instruction.  It allows students to construct meaning as they work through complex
, real life word problems.  
Teachers who use this instructional strategy need to be trai
ned in the nuances of lesson planning (to effectively build upon prior knowledge), finding the 
balance between allowing students to struggle and providing instruction/guidance/feedback, and providing the necessary tools 
required for students to 
communicate
 
their understanding in a variety of ways.  Along with CGI training, district PD opportunities are provided to staff via the F
rontline Education 
website.  Staff can view all upcoming trainings and register for any that pertain to their grade level or span.
  
In addition to this, the district supports our 
newly hired teachers by providing the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program.  This program places each qual
ifying teacher with a 
support provider/mentor who regularly checks in with the tea
cher and provides supports necessary for the teacher's professional development.
 
 
At the site level, we have two days as administrators that we use exclusively for PD.  In the 2019
-
20 calendar year, Rancho Verde held PD on August 5th 
and December 
19th.  On the 19th, teachers participated in a PD session on bullying.  In addition to these full days, we also have five ann
ual Staff Meetings 
and 22 Student Early Release Days (SERD).  Our  SERDs are used by grade levels to review student work, analyze d
ata and increase effective instruction 
through dialogue.  There are some days where grade levels or spans of grade levels participate in PD opportunities with admin
istration or outside 
resources (ex. Active Shooter drill/Guided Reading/Para expectations/PB
IS).  Our Staff Meetings also allow us to hold group PD sessions.  The site level 
also offers "between the bells" PD via our instructional coach.  Our instructional coach works individually with teachers who
 
request support.  The teacher 
and coach work tog
ether to identify areas of need, create an achievable goal, decide how the goal will be measured and then plan out observatio
ns and 
other supports the teacher may need in order to meet the goal.
 
 
Last year (2018/19) and this year (2019/20), Rancho Verde's 
primary focus has been math instruction.  A majority of our students are not meeting grade 
level standards, as measured by the SBAC state assessment. Online curriculum (iReady Math) was purchased by the district.  We
 
have held several PDs 
regarding usage o
f this program and continue to familiarize ourselves with the tools the program offers.  Our instructional coach has introduc
ed Number 
Collections to our teachers and it is beginning to be used consistently.  CGI training continues to be completed by all t
eachers. Two types of interim 
assessments are used for growth monitoring purposes: interim comprehensive assessments (ICAs) and interim assessment blocks (
IABs). ICAs mirror the 
summative assessment in scope and format, while IABs focus on smaller sets of 
related concepts and provide more detailed information for instructional 
purposes.  Utilizing these components last year, we saw an 8% growth in math performance, based on state assessments.
