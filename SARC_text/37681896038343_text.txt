About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Prior
ity 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We welcome parents to volunteer on campus in any number of capac
ities. Each and every day we have parent volunteers in our classrooms enhancing 

nteer opportunities.
 
 
At Lakeside Farms, we offer a
 
parent engagement program. The Operating principle is inclusion 

 
reaching across all parent groups and bringing them 
together in support of their common interest in helping children succeed. Our trained facilitators lead interactive sessions 
for parent p
articipants based 
on developed curriculum. The sessions include individual and group activities, art activities and discussions. These allow op
portunities for parents to 
build relationships with each other, their child(ren) and with school and district lea
ders.
 
 
Lakeside Farms also features a reading support program called Everyone A Reader (EAR). Volunteers are matched up with emergin
g readers to support 
them as they grow in their reading ability. We also have a Helping Hands program through our PTA. Inter
ested volunteers check in to the office where 
teachers leave projects and directions for our volunteers to complete.
 
 
Our PTA continuously looks to add volunteers to our program. If you are interested or available to help, please contact our s
chool office 
manager, Jennifer 
Davic at (619) 390
-
2646.
 
 
We love that our parents and community members take an active role at their school.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Student safety is an 
important goal at Lakeside Farms. We teach our students about several important character traits through our Positive Behavio
r 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) Character Education program. Students are recognized at school for making wise choices in t
he c
lassroom and on the 
playground in relation to these three character traits (Safe, Responsible and Respectful).  We continuously communicate good 
character virtues to our 
students with the goal of producing honorable citizens.
 
 
Our campus is safe and secure
 
for our students. Many parents accompany their children to school each day and several stay to volunteer in classrooms. 
All visitors to our campus are required to sign in and out each day, so that we may have an accurate count of everyone at all
 
times.
 
 
O
ur School Safety Plan is updated each year. We practice several drills annually: earthquake, fire, and lockdown/secure campus
. Our staff and students 
perform each of these drills with careful attention so that we may be ready if or when an emergency occurs
. Our goal is to keep all students, volunteers 
and staff safe.

Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
Math and Writing are the 
two primary/major areas of focus for the staff due to the data we received from our site and state assessm
ents. Teachers will attend conferences, 
trainings and after
-
school workshops. In
-
class coaching and time for weekly collaboration is provided to assist teachers throughout the school year.
 
 
Across the District:
 
 
SCIENCE 

 
 
The primary areas of focus for st
aff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) 
and moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus areas include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling
 
up Professiona
l Learning 
and Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Co
llaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5) Addressing supplemental instructional materials.
 
 
Professional develo
pment needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Science Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedback data collected via prior professional learning events in the 
distri
ct.
 
 
Professional Learning for the 2019
-
20 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and content training.  This will occur primarily through science lesson study for 
all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
Core Leadership Team and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training in 
the areas of Leadership, Facilitation of Professional Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation In
itiative Program.  

s will be provided NGSS professional learning facilitated by their district Teacher Leader peers through 
the established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district PD days.
 
Other opportunities for science professional learning 
include supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.
 
 
Administrator professional learning will address NGSS innovations, strategies to identify 
and support high quality science instruction (observations and 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both on site and through district management meetings via the Early Im
plementer Initiative.
 
 
Next Generation Science Standards Teacher Lea
ders, Expansion Teachers, and administrators are supported via NGSS Early Implementation Initiative 
Project Director, on
-
site Core Leadership Team members and/or Teacher Leaders.
 
 
MATH 

 
 
LUSD focused on mathematics as a professional development goal in 
response to low performance scores on the CAASPP and to support teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.

Professional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways:  1) Workshops (after school, on professional grow
th days, an
d during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and small group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
Teachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and use of curriculum materials through: 1) Workshops focuse
d on th
e content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math content they teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content and practice s
tandards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on unit and lesson design with their curriculum materials (within 
school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
both in one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning activities 
and receive additional training from a leadership p
erspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
Social
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus areas in the 19
-
20 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselors continue the work of supporting the social and
 
emotional needs of students.   Two Behavior Specialists 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support students with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Two MTS
S Teachers on Special 
Assignment (TOSAs) were added to support the develop
ment of social/emotional/behavioral intervention systems at four of our Elementary sites.
 
 
Professional Development and Coaching have focused on Conscious Classroom Management strategies.  Conscious Classroom Teachin
g provides teachers 
with professional de
velopment and coaching on Tier I and II behavioral strategies.  MTSS TOSAs are also available to coach on classroom managemen
t 
strategies and student behavior plans.
 
 
Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School District continues to support principal growth throug
h Professional Development and has deepened our support of teacher leaders 
in the 2018
-
2019 school year. Teacher leaders (Facilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as conten
t support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Le
arning. The Facilitators, in turn, provide on
-
site coaching to their respective staffs.
