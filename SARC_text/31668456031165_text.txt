About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School
 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Con
trol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data r
eported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF
 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 5, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had suffic
ient and good quality 
textbooks, instructiona
l materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, inclu
ding 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subj
ects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approv
ed for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office pr
ior to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in September, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relev
ant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Ophir 
Elementary School greatly benefits from its supportive parents who care about the traditions of Ophir and its student
-
centered environment. The 
school has a strong base of parent volunteers who support our students and staff. There are a multitude of oppor
tunities for parents to be involved in 
the Ophir school community: serving on School Site Council (SSC), serving as volunteers in the classrooms, chaperones on fiel
d trips, and participating in 
the Parent Teacher Club (PTC). The SSC assists in the review, 
updating, monitoring and evaluation of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan and the Single 
School Plan for Student Achievement. The PTC helps to organize and facilitate school/community activities, raises money to su
pport our school, and 
supports our schoo
l through encouraging parental involvement. The school also benefits from several community partnerships, including the Loomi
s 
Basin Education Foundation (LBEF), Loomis Lions, Loomis Rotary Club, Auburn Assistance League and Soroptimist International o
f Hi
storic Auburn. If 
interested in participating in these opportunities, parents are encouraged to contact the main office at (530) 885

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil su
spension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Ophir Elementary School. The school is always in compliance with all
 
laws, rules, 
and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually by
 
the School Site Council, 
is reviewed on an annual basis by community members (through an open forum) and by staff 

includes actions for ensuring student, staff  and community members' safety during a disaster. Actions include procedures/pro
cesses in response to a 
variety of crises, the incident command system, e
vacuation and relocation destinations, staging areas, and recovery and aftermath. The Comprehensive 
School Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated on October 4, 2018.
 
 
Fire, lockdown, shelter in place, and earthquake drills are conducted on a regular bas
is throughout the school year.

As part of the professional growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the distric
t and individual school sites 
to administrators, teachers, certificated and classified staff.
 
 
The district offered five staff deve
lopment days during the 2017
-
2018 school year and three staff development days during the 2018
-
19 and 2019
-
20 
school years.  During these staff development days staff members are offered professional growth opportunities to expand staf
f knowledge in curric
ulum, 
assessment and instructional strategies.
 
 
At the site level, Ophir Elementary offers teachers specific training in areas related to our school wide focus of Science, T
echnology, Engineering, Arts 
and Mathematics (S.T.E.A.M.) to enhance student learni
ng. Specifically, trainings have been offered in the following areas:  Google Apps For Education 
(GAFE)/G
-
Suite, STEAM, the engineering design process, and computer programming/robotics. Staff meetings and professional learning com
munities 
serve as platfor
ms to continue support throughout implementation.
 
 
Topics are determined through district identified needs (based upon the 8 state priorities of the Local Control Accountabilit
y Plan), parent/student/staff 
survey results, staff feedback from previous profe
ssional development days, and site determined needs assessment data.
