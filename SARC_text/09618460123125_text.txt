Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Camino Polytechnic, a Science and Natural Resources Charter School, held a public hearing in September 2017, and 
determin

by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee 
composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Camino Polytechnic, a Science and Natural Resources Charter School, consists of 6 classrooms located on the Camino 
Union School District campus, a beautiful 40
-
acre site in the pine 
trees at the 3,200
-
foot elevation.  Camino Polytechnic 
shares 1 gym, 1 multipurpose room/cafeteria, 1 library, 1 staff lounge, 2 computer labs, 2 playgrounds, large athletic fields
, 
a school garden and many other amenities not offered by other schools. All
 
classroom spaces are utilized to their fullest 
extent.  The facilities enable the school to provide plenty of space for all educational programs including regular 
classrooms, library, special education, after
-
school enrichment programs and staff rooms.  R
egular maintenance and 
modernization has kept rest rooms, flooring, walls, roofs and plumbing in good working service.
 
 
The administration and maintenance staff are committed to maintaining a safe environment that is conducive to learning.  
Vandalism and g
raffiti are immediately addressed before students and staff are aware.  Staff collects garbage and cleans 
the campus daily.  Students are involved in campus cleanup efforts.  Parent volunteers and an active garden program 
regularly improve our campus envir
onment.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal works daily with the custodial staff of 2 full
-
time employees to ensure that the cleaning of 
the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school.  The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standa
rds for all schools in the district.  A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review. 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are c
ompleted in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority are given to emergency repairs.
 
 
The Camino Community passed "Measure H" in June 2016, to fix and replace aging infrastructure throughout the campus
.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Camino Polytechnic, a Science and Natural Resources Charter School.  
The school is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 
standards. Th

preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are 
conducted on a regular basis throughout
 
the school year. Lockdown drills are held twice a year. Students are supervised 
before and after school, and during lunch and recess, by certificated staff, classified staff, and school administration. 
Parent volunteers help with supervision during lunch 
and break periods. There is a designated area for student drop off 
and pick up. Visitors must sign in at the front office before coming on campus, to receive a visitor badge indicating visit 
destination and purpose.
 
 
We are proud of the safety record of ou
r buses.  Most Camino students ride our buses, driven by experienced, licensed 
drivers.  Here at Camino, student safety is of primary importance!

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the district and 
individual school sites to administrators, teachers, and classified staff. The district encourages staff to seek out areas of
 
training and
 
interest and provides funding. The District has recently adopted their Educator Effectiveness Plan and our 
Charter staff will be benefiting from those opportunities. 
 
 
The Camino Union School District EEP allocation is based on 5.78 certificated full time
 
equivalent (FTE) and listed at a total 
of $8,477 to be allocated and spent over three years. 
 
 
On or before July 1, 2018, Districts must report detailed expenditure information to CDE. 
 
 
The professional development priorities for Camino Union School Dist
rict are:
 

 
Math content standards
 

 
Math curriculum materials training
 

 
English Language Arts/English Language Development standards
 

 
English Language Arts/English Language Development materials selection and training
 

 
Multi

The use of the Educator Effectiveness funds will target the identified priorities over the course of three years. We will 
utilize training provided through the El Dorado County Office of Education whenever possible to minimize costs.
