Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the
 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with al
ternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements
 
for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Peggy Heller's comprehensive Safety Plan includes an Emergency Preparedness Committee that is trained to respond 
quickly and efficiently to any safety threat to our campus.  Furthermore, every staff member on campus has a specific role 
to play in the event
 
of an emergency and is equipped with the proper material to carry out their part of the plan.  From 
Emergency Backpacks to student information kits, and evacuation materials, each staff member has their supplies kept in 
a visual and accessible location. G
uests on campus such as substitutes are provided with information on how to react to 
specific emergencies on campus, and maps with evacuation routes are located in all buildings and classrooms.  Staff and 
students practice drills such as Fire, Evacuation, 
A.L.i.C.E, Earthquake, AED, and Lockdown each year.  The last safety plan 
meeting was October 4th, 2019. The School Safety Plan was submitted to the board for approval on October 8th, 2019, 
and was approved by the School Board on November 12th, 2019.  Scho
ol Site Council also reviews the site plan each year.
 
At Peggy Heller School, we believe meaningful learning must occur in a safe, disciplined, and positive environment. To 
achieve such an environment, a set of expectations for student behavior, attendance
, and dress has been established. 
Student dress code and consequences for inappropriate behavior are outlined in the student handbook/agenda. The 
rules/expectations are distributed at the beginning of each school year and when a new student enrolls. Superv
ision is 
provided by classroom teachers, campus supervisors, instructional assistants, and the administrative staff.
