By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The safety and cleanliness of the school's facilities is of utmost importance. The staff believes that all students and paren
ts 
expect and deserve a clean, safe and healthy school environment. The school is fortunate to ha
ve both versatility and 
beauty which is displayed with murals that adorn the outdoor amphitheater and many outside walls. The handball walls 
also reflect our school pride and have been designed and painted by students, parents and local community artists.
 
 
The staff continues to build the community pride needed to enable us to maintain and improve our school facilities.  Staff 
and parent members continue to meet and discuss long
-
range campus landscaping plans, which include large play 
structures, flowers, 
and new paint on walls and eaves. Our PTA regularly coordinates parent volunteers to maintain planter 
beds, tree trimming, and general school cleanliness.

Age of School Buildings
 
The construction of Arroyo Verde School was completed in November, 1990. Th
e campus officially opened on November 
14th when students and staff moved onto campus. The facility offers a variety of creative spaces that enhance the learning 
process. In addition to the 28 classrooms, the school consists of a literacy lab, a multipurpo
se room equipped with a stage 
and kitchen, an outdoor amphitheater, large group instruction areas in the courtyards, and individual instruction areas to 
meet the needs of speech, resource, and limited
-
English students. The school also contains smaller room
s to 
accommodate audio
-
visual equipment, textbook and materials storage, custodial storage, teachers' lounge, and teachers' 
workroom. The entire campus is centrally air
-
conditioned and heated. Through a generous Grant by Lowe's Corporation, 
all classrooms 
are equipped with a state of the art audio/visual system. This system includes an LCD projector, screen and 
four speaker sound system with a wall mounted controlling system. This system projects information from both computers 
and DVD players.
 
 
Maintenance
 
and Repairs
 
Site custodians monitor the campus for regular maintenance needs, and perform basic upkeep and repairs.  Work orders 
are placed with the District Service Center as needed. The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools 
in R
USD. A summary of these standards is available at the school office, at the District Office, or at 
www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school. District maintena
nce staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and 
working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Our two 
custodians clean our classrooms, kitchen, and bathrooms daily.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Arroyo Verde School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to evaluate 
the current status of school climate. A Safe School Plan is adopted each school year and is reflective of the 
school's safety 
needs.  The Safe School Plan is reviewed, discussed, and revised at the first site staff meeting. It is reviewed and discusse
d 
at Coffee with the Principal, School Site Council. and ELAC.
 
 
The key components of Arroyo Verde's Safe School Pl
an includes a description of school discipline policies and procedures, 
dress code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, 
dangerous pupil notification, and disaster response procedures. 
Additionally, Arroyo Verde has forged a close working 
relationship with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department and Highland Fire Department to support and maintain 
a safe campus.
 
 
To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, teachers, a
nd the Principal supervise the school grounds 
including the bus drop
-
off area, cafeteria, and playground. During the school day all entrance areas to the school are 
locked with the exception of the entrance to the front office. All visitors must enter thro
ugh the front office and obtain a 
visitor's pass. Arroyo Verde utilizes the Raptor visitor management system to increase safety protocols for students and 
staff.
 
 
After school, teachers release their students to the bus loading area or parent pick up line 
and a crossing guard ensures 
students cross the street safely. Teachers, campus monitors, and the Principal supervise the areas until all students have 
left the campus for home.

19)
 
 
Arroyo Verde Elementary School receives both general and categorical funds that pay for support personnel, staff 
development, curriculum development, grade level collaboration, data team meetings and the 
purchase of materials to 
enhance the curriculum. Supplemental categorical funding sources come from the following: School
-
wide Title I, Title I, 
Part A, (parent involvement) Title III, Tier II LCAP funds, School Improvement and donations.
 
 
Title I is a fed
erally funded program that provides remedial help for students in the areas of reading, language, and math. 
Intervention teacher salaries, materials and teacher salaries are also covered by this fund as they meet the needs of our 
most academically challeng
ed students. School Improvement Program (SIP) is a state funded program for all students, 
kindergarten through grade five. The funds from this program are used to provide supplemental materials and educational 
opportunities for students. Our LCAP funds are
 
provided on the basis of enrollment of students who demonstrate limited 
proficiency in English and are identified as economically disadvantaged. These funds provide intervention teacher salaries, 
materials and teacher salaries for after
-
school programs, c
onference and workshop fees, as well as supplemental 
classroom materials. All students receive instruction and support towards mastery of grade
-
level content standards 
utilizing a standards
-
based curriculum. In an effort to increase student mastery of esse
ntial state academic standards, 
students will be provided with several specific interventions to help them be successful in our district and state assessment
 
programs. Teachers will receive detailed analysis of their students' achievement on each subsectio
n of the SBAC utilizing 
the Illuminate system. Students will be assessed with formative and summative assessments and data will be reviewed in 
order to increase student growth and achievement.
