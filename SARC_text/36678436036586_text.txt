By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Smiley Elementary School is dedicated to providing a safe, nurtu
ring environment, which is intellectually challenging yet 
stimulating and includes opportunities for students to develop their sense of responsibility, independence and a love for 
learning. As part of the Redlands Unified School District, Smiley Elementary
 
School will support students towards the RUSD 
Vision.  Our students will be empowered with the knowledge and commitment necessary to confront the challenges of 
our changing world, as they become leaders in the 21st century.
 
 
The vision for Redlands 2025 w
ill focus on five key areas:
 

 
E 
-
 
Enhanced Learning through Innovation
 

 
X 
-
 
Excellence in Academics
 

 
C 
-
 
Collaborative Community and Parent Partnerships
 

 
E 
-
 
Equality through Equity
 

 
L 
-
 
Learning Environments are Safe and Secure
 
 
Located in the Redlands Unified
 
School District, Smiley Elementary School continues to enjoy a tradition of excellence. 
Named after Alfred and Albert Smiley, philanthropists who contributed to various community projects and helped create 
the city's public library, the campus was constru
cted over a ten
-
year period starting in 1954.
 
 
Smiley Elementary School is on a traditional schedule serving approximately 650 students in Kindergarten through 5th 
grades.  The student body is made up of an ethnically
-
diverse population that celebrates var
ied cultural heritages and 
embraces 15 home languages.   Although Smiley Elementary School is located in a middle class neighborhood, 
approximately one
-
half (49%) lives in poverty and receives free/reduced lunch.  Walking the playground is all that is 
requ
ired to feel the Responsible, Respectful and Safe atmosphere that is continuing to develop at Smiley Elementary 
School.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
December 2019
 
 
The California State Board of Education reviews elementary level textbooks and
 
adopts those that meet standards defined 
in the State Frameworks. Textbooks are selected in the Redlands Unified School District through a committee of teachers 
and administrators. They review the materials that have been approved for purchase. Teachers a
t each site have an 
opportunity to preview texts prior to selection.
 
In the past,
 
textbooks were selected and purchased on a seven
-
year cycle, 
rotating by content area. Current state budget
 
funding has led the District to modify the cycle
 
with the most rec
ent 
adoption
 
being a kindergarten through fifth grade Science program in 2008. Copies of student books are available at the 
Instructional Resource Center for parent review. Program candidates feature a variety of instructional materials and 
technology to e
nhance the instructional program for our students and are aligned with State Grade Level Standards. All 
Smiley Elementary students are provided with all state and district adopted materials in their classrooms, and receive 
instruction in the core curriculu
m.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The oldest portion of Smiley School includes the office wing and rooms one through ten which were built in 19
52. As the 
school population continued to grow, four more wings were added in the 1960s. Smiley School currently has thirty
-
one 
classrooms, a multipurpose room, and school library. We are presently in the process of building a STEAM Lab and Digital 
Playgro

conditioning units since 1993. In December 2019, 24 classrooms were updated with new HVAC units.
 
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards
 
for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff t
o 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe scho
ol. The school facilities are inspected monthly, and needed 
repairs are either done by the custodians or are submitted to the District via work orders. Monthly Inspection Reports are 
submitted to the District. Rooms and buildings are all adequately prepare
d to meet the needs of students in a clean and 
safe environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repairs:
 
When maintenance and repairs are needed, the site custodians are notified and work or repairs are made, if possible. 
District maintenance staff ensures that larger o
r more complicated repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order, are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure good communication, 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priori
ty.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Smiley is fortunate to have a 
very dedicated group of parents, grandparents, friends and community members who 
volunteer regularly. Volunteers can be found in classrooms helping teachers and students with a variety of tasks. As an 
example, our Book Bridges Reading Program is implemente
d in kindergarten through second grade and requires 
volunteers to read individually with each student four days per week. Volunteers chart their progress and help students 
select a new book to take home each night.
 
 
Our PTA has been extremely supportive of
 
our volunteer programs and has two coordinators who assist the staff with 
volunteers. They continue to take on the task of providing classroom volunteers who assist as instructional docents for 
our Arts Attack program, etc.   The PTA also sponsors the fol
lowing programs that require much parent involvement to be 
successful:  Running Club, Smiley Campout, Game Board Night, Pancake Breakfast, Class Parties, and Field Trips.
 
 
Parents also participate on the School Site Council as well as on site and district 
level committees. Smiley is also fortunate 
to have former alumnae return during their breaks to assist in the primary classrooms. Smiley continues to be recognized 
as having above average volunteer hours for the RUSD.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Smiley Elementary School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to 
evaluate the
 
current status of school crime and safety. A Safe School Plan is updated and adopted each school year and is 
reflective of the school's safety needs.
 
 
The key components of Smiley's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline policies and 
procedures, dress 
code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, 
dangerous pupil notification, and disaster response procedures. The Safety Plan is continuously revised with updated 
informa
tion and training and under the direction of the District.
 
 
The Redlands Police Department is available to provide truancy support, counseling, education, and law enforcement 
activities for students as well as for parent informational workshops.

School Sa
fety:
 
To ensure student safety before school, campus monitors, teachers and administrators supervise the school grounds 
including the bus drop
-
off area, loading zones, cafeteria and playground. During the school day all entrance areas to the 
school are 
locked with the exception of the office.  All persons desiring entry must enter the office and be screened through 
the Raptor system.  All adults on campus must have an employee badge or an official visitors sticker visible at all times.  
Signs are posted 
to indicate all visitors must report to the administration office and may not be on school grounds unless 
they have a visitor's pass.
 
 
Before school, only students are allowed access to the school grounds.  Any parent or visitor must go through the office 
and be screened through the raptor system.
 
 
After school, students exit school ground through one of the designated gates.  They will walk to the bus loading area, 
walk home or the car pick up area. Staff supervise these areas until all students have left 
the campus for home.
