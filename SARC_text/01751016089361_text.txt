School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Vintage Hills 
Elementary School, a 2015 National Blue Ribbon School and 2014 
California Distinguished School! Our school encompasses talented students, a dedicated staff, and 
a supportive community. Collaboratively, these stakeholders help to make Vintage Hills a wonder
ful 
place to learn. I invite you to explore Vintage Hills' Annual School Accountability Report Card, which 
provides valuable information about our school's instructional programs, academic achievement, 
classroom materials, school safety, facilities, and st
aff. Understanding our educational program, 
student achievement, and curriculum development can assist both our school and the community 
in the continuous improvement of our quality academic program.
 
 
Vintage Hills provides a warm, stimulating environment 
where students are actively involved in 
learning academics, as well as, positive values. Students receive a standards
-
based, rigorous 
curriculum delivered by a dedicated professional staff based on individual student needs. Ongoing 
evaluation of student pr
ogress and achievement helps us refine the instructional program so 
students can achieve academic proficiency. We are very fortunate to have such strong partnerships 
with the parents of our students and members of our community. Parents are vital to our te
am 
approach philosophy. They can be seen daily in classrooms, as instructors in our enrichment 
programs, serving on school committees, and actively involved in special programs. Our success 
can be attributed to the invaluable partnerships between students,
 
staff, parents, and community.
 
 
At Vintage Hills, staff and parents work together to create a learning environment that promotes 
academic, social and emotional development, teaches responsibility and pride, and models 
learning as a lifelong 
adventure. We are proud of our school and welcome all to join in our efforts 
to create successful, responsible citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by
 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are r
equired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP i
s to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and In
structional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Instructional Materials
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Vintage Hills Elementary School are currently being aligned to the California St
ate Standards.  Instructional 
materials are selected from 
the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education.  The district follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social
 
science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify t
he extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The Board of Trustees adopted
 
Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learner
s, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or instruc
tional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent 
with the cycl
es and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for 
their visual/performing 
arts curricula.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided each student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in c
lass and to take home.  These materials complied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.
