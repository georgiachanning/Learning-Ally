About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Plan
ned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and
 
conduct 
inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest prio
rity.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

 
The 
district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is avai
lable at the 
school office or at the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop 
cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 

 
The district does not participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program designed to assist school districts with 
expenditures for 
major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. The program was eliminated in 2010
-
2011. The district does allocate 
funds to a Routine Restricted Maintenance account which is designed to fund district expenditures for major repair or replace
ment of exi
ting 
school building components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior pain
ting, and floor 
systems.
 
 
Ben Hulse Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. 
The majority of school facilities were built in 1954; 
the Roosevelt wing (the northern
-
most wing) was built in 1949. The school facilities are situated on 16 acres. The school buildings span 86,667 square 
feet consisting of 30 permanent classrooms and 25 p
ortable classrooms which includes 1 intervention classroom, 7 Science Discovery rooms, and a 
meeting room for our parent/teacher organization. A library, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, an administrative office with a c
onference room and nurse's 
office, two
 
staff work rooms and a Speech room are also part of the large school. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning th
rough its ample 
classroom and recreation space. The table shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate 
(Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Ben Hulse Elementary School.  The school has a closed campus; a
ll visitors must sign in at the 
front office and wear an identification badge while on school grounds. Classified employees attended an Active Shooter traini
ng in August.  
Recommendations that were suggested after the training have been implemented.   Stud
ent supervision aides are provided with Two
-
Way radios to 
communicate to the office personnel and administration.  Gate keys are provided as another level of support if quick access w
as needed for evacuations.  
Student supervision aides are on duty before 
and after school and during recess and lunch periods to ensure a safe and orderly environment.  Numerous 
video cameras are also strategically placed around the campus to ensure security and safety of students and staff.  A securit
y fence was installed in 2
018
-
2019.  Electronic key card gates are used by staff.  A security guard supports safety and monitors the campus during the most
 
busy times of the day.  A 
district
-
wide School Resource Officers works with administration to support students and parents.  T
he SRO and security guard also work closely with 
our attendance clerk to monitor student attendance.  In addition, we have a safety patrol program that allows students the op
portunity to take ownership 
of school safety before and after school as students e
nter and leave our campus.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school incl
udes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies relate
d to suspension and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; 
sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school evaluates the plan annually and updates it 
as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are reviewed with school 
and district staff at the start of each school year. The plan is updated and reviewed with school staff in each year.

be an ongoing 
process. Curriculum guides are updated regularly to align with the state standards, district goals, and the statewide
 
assessment program.   Technology 
and Project Based Learning (PBL's) have been a focus of in previous year's professional development.  These two focus areas w
ere chosen based on the 
four C's:  Communication, Critical Thinking, Creativity and Collaboration
