By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Granite Hill has approximately 480 students, located in the Jurupa Valley area of Riverside County. The school opened in 
1992 and is the 14th of the 16 elementary school in the Jurupa Unif
ied School district.Granite Hill Elementary School is 
dedicated to helping all students learn, as well as developing their critical thinking skills, teaching them to respect other
s, 
and providing many opportunities for academic success so that they can app
ly their knowledge in a safe and welcoming 
environment. Granite Hill is an AVID Elementary school site. AVID assists students to become lifelong learners and achieve 
their career goals. We foster a shared leadership, involve our parents and community and p
ride ourselves in making and 
encouraging positive choices. The collaboration between teachers, staff members, and families is critical. Our program 
prepares students for the future by instilling lifelong skills for students to be college and career ready. 
All students receive 
instruction that supports mastery of the California State Standards. Teachers regularly meet to discuss effective teaching 
strategies, and they analyze data to determine what steps need to be taken to ensure that our students develop a
 
deep 
understanding of the California State Standards. Our goal is for our students to be prepared with all skills and knowledge 
they will need to be successful in future academic or career paths.
 
 
We have implemented several programs to help students beco
me more successful: Health and safety programs include 
the 100 Mile Club, and Parenting classes. The 100 Mile Club on campus supports running/walking as a means of promoting 
the Healthy Bodies/Healthy Minds initiative.  In addition, the school safety commi
ttee meets regularly to update, revise, 
and improve our school
-
wide safety plan to ensure that students will be safe in the event of an emergency.  Academic 
Programs include our California State Standards Units of Study, Grade level Impact Team Collaborati
on, Think Together 
Program, School Clubs, GATE program, Primary Intervention Program, Upper grade Guided Reading Intervention Program, 
and Special Education Programs. To help our students fully master the California State Standards, teachers have had 
exten
sive staff development focusing on the current initiatives in Language Arts, Science and Math.  Assessments are 
common core standard aligned.  Our after
-
school Think Together program is offered to students in grades 1 
-
 
6 to provide 
homework assistance, en
richment programs/clubs, and includes an intramural sports program.  Our GATE program is for 
students in grades 3 
-
 
6. GATE enrichment opportunities include special clubs, field trips, and differentiated instruction in 
the classroom. Our Primary Interventi
on program continues for students who are reading below grade level in grades 1 
-
 
3. Our intervention teacher works closely with the classroom teachers to strategically plan effective lessons based on the 
Reading Foundational Skills. Our goal is to have al
l students reading by third grade. Intensive reading support is provided 
daily for students in the classroom and through the primary intervention program. Progress monitoring is a key part of 
the program using DIBELS data. This year we implemented our "pus
h
-
in" Guided Reading Intervention program for 
students in grades 4
-
6.  Progress is determined using Pioneer Valley computer
-
based running records along with the 
traditional paper pencil format. Another tool utilized is Istation, a researched
-
based Computer
 
Progress Monitoring 
Program, that helps determine progress and guide instruction. For students who have special needs, health impairments, 
or learning disabilities, we have a Student Study Team, a Resource Specialist Program Teachers, a Speech Pathologist
, and 
a school Psychologist on campus. Counselors from various agencies also support students and families through the district 
PICO office.

Granite Hill continues to make great strides to incorporate technology in the classroom. Each student in grades 2
-
6 have 
their own Chromebook and grades Kindergarten and First grade have Chromebooks in classrooms for students to use.  In 
addition, students use the computers to research, write reports, collaborate, complete homework, communicate with 
staff, build compu
ter skills and for educational games. Our Socio Emotional Learning (SEL) program and SEL team have 
worked to improve school
-
wide social skill expectations and the program. We have incorporated a series of incentives for 
our students who practice positive b
ehavior on campus.  We have a great working team at Granite Hill, and it is a true 
privilege to work with an amazing group of students and a team of hard
-
working professionals who work together to make 
Granite Hill a great place to learn!

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School 
District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the 
appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, t
he State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected f
rom the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/
social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school a
nd high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on t
heir 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of our school facilities are high priorities in the Jurupa Unified School District. 
Overall, school grounds and facilities are in good condition. The district's Deferred Maintenance Plan is assessed and 
updated every year.
 
Work generated by the Deferred Maintenance Plan is generally completed during the summer 
months. Fire inspections are conducted annually and any issues are addressed immediately. The district also has an 
internal inspection team conducting annual safety i
nspections of all sites. All safety
-
related items are handled as a top 
priority. Our school has approximately 30 classrooms (22 classrooms and 8 portables), a school library, and multiple mini 
offices to accommodate the growing population. We have two full
 
time custodians (day and evening) assisting with 
maintaining cleanliness and safety of our buildings and facilities. Our morning custodian opens the school at 6:00 and 
works until 2:30. Our evening custodian works from 2:30 
-
 
11:00 PM. Student safety is c
onducted by all staff members on 
campus including office staff, teachers, support staff, activity supervisors, and crossing guards. A school
-
wide effort to 
Keep Our Campus Clean has been implemented. Daily announcements, posters, and reminders are given da
ily.
 
In October of 2019, site experienced a brush fire in close proximity to campus.  Due to the extent of the smoke damage, 
all air filters were replaced along with an extensive cleaning of the campus.  All areas of campus, both inside and out, were
 
resto
red using a private restoration company to ensure that all particulate matter was removed and that students and 
staff were not in contact with any residual matter.
 
Maintenance for future consideration may be in regards to plumbing needs. The structure of t
he pipes are older and have 
required many servicing calls to address flooding issues throughout campus.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents play an active role in our program through their participation in parent trainings, AVID workshops, parent 
conferences, volunteering in classrooms, School Site Council, and the English Learner Advisory Committee. We have an 
active parent group that
 
assists in coordinating school activities and assists school in fundraising efforts. Meetings are held 
approximately once a month for each of these committees. Parents are encouraged to volunteer in classrooms, attend 
field trips, and to participate in ot
her school events. Throughout the year, parent
-
student workshops focusing on areas 
such as AVID strategies, nutrition, technology, parenting, science, reading, and mathematics are held. These include 
Science Fair Night, Dr. Seuss Literacy Night, and Read T
o Me Literacy Night.  Translation and childcare are offered based 
on the needs of parents. Several other workshops are held on campus including Parenting Classes, and many types of 
Technology classes.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan is reviewed and updated annually by the school safety coordinators and administration. It is 
presented to the School Site Council for review and approval each year. The leadership team plays a critical role in 
disseminating important
 
information regarding school safety. The leadership team in conjunction with the school safety 
committee work to determine school needs. Parent committees such as ELAC and SSC have an opportunity to review the 
School Safety Plan and offer suggestions on p
ossible improvements. In addition, the school adheres to the guidelines in 

school handbook and teachers provide instruction on the rules, 
safety procedures, and sexual harassment in the 
classroom. The staff also attends a Sexual Harassment Training and Mandated Reporter Training every year.
 
 
Emergency drills (fire, earthquake and lockdown drills) are practiced on a monthly basis and the scho
ol participates in the 
state's yearly Great ShakeOut drill. During these drills, staff provides suggestions to improve our school plan as necessary.
 
We have emergency water and food supplies, blankets, first aid supplies, radios, flashlights, and tools rec
ommended for 
use in a disaster. An inventory of these items is taken annually so that items can be replenished as necessary. Students 
are also asked to bring in Comfort Kits with non
-
perishable food items and a water bottle in a Ziploc bag to keep in the 
c
lassroom emergency supply bin, for use in the event of an emergency. GH parents sell them at an affordable price to 
make every effort in ensuring all students have one. The school safety team meets monthly to review the plan, inventory 
supplies, or to disc
uss a recent drill. At these meetings, information is collected and reviewed to determine the 
effectiveness of our plan. The safety team attends district workshops as well as RCOE workshops on safety. Suggestions 
are brought back to the school site for dis
cussion.

School administrators, teachers, and paraprofessionals attend district and site

based professional development activities, 
as well as outside conferences and training relevant to the current curriculum and instructional programs. Major focus of 
professiona
l development has been related to AVID strategies, guided reading practices, impact team protocols, Balanced 
Math practices, and NGSS units of implementation. Professional development occurs through the use of collaboration 
time and continues to occur on a
 
weekly basis.
 
 
There are other committees which teachers serve on that provide insight and staff development. These include Science 
Committee, Instructional Council, Technology committees, and GATE committees. Granite Hill has four grade levels 
participat
ing in Impact Team Collaboration. Teachers review instructional strategies and support students develop 
ownership of their learning as well as to build teacher clarity on the CCSS. District support for Impact teams is ongoing to 
assist teachers to facilita
te the process of analyzing student work using common success criteria to evaluate effectiveness 
of student learning. Evidence of learning is portrayed through formal and informal testing data. Communication through 
principal
-
teacher conferences, walk

thro
ugh feedback, and staff meetings are also methods of support.
