By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
current enrollment is 765 
students. This 12
-
acre, 70,000 square foot building is surrounded by beautiful landscaping, row s of trees, and a walking 
path. An outdoor stage overlooks areas of the playground and is for student performances, including a weekl
y activity of 
students reciting the pledge and singing the school song together. Just to the west of the stage is a shaded eating area 
where students snack and lunch when weather permits. A full
-
time daily custodian is assigned to the site and maintenance 
personnel as needed.
 
 
Students are taught to care for their school and join in the efforts to keep our environment safe, orderly, and clean. A 
reward system of "caught being great" encourages students to pick up after themselves, to collect litter, and to 
retrieve 
equipment without being asked to do so. Staff models the "above expectations" behaviors and reminds students that they 
are vital contributors to a cleanly environment. Our custodians diligently work to keep all areas of the school clean.  The 
admi
nistration confers with the lead custodian daily, covering the needs of the staff, ensuring smooth operational 
efficiency.
 
 
The site amenities include fully equipped computer Chromebook cart stations for every second through the fifth
-
grade 
classroom. Ever
y two first grade classes share a Chromebook cart station in addition to their iPads for Center rotations. 
Kindergarten also has iPads for Center Rotations. We are utilizing the information collected from BrightBytes surveys to 
develop technology training 
for staff and students. Staff and parents provided input to the development of our safety 
plan, which includes the requirement of all visitors checking in at the office and the gates remaining locked throughout 
the day.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the HBE Comprehensive
 
School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills h
elp to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
H
BE staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, which include a leveled/colored 

-
in using our Raptor 
system. HBE 
Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly emergency drills and 
provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foste
r lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All HBE staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate 
complaint matte
rs thoroughly.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared to increase student 
engagement through 
the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be
 
aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been on the adopted curriculum and interventi
on. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provided before, during, and after school by 
either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and administrators continue to take 
college
-
level 
courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
