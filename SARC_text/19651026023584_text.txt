By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Even though Quartz Hill Elementary is an old school it remains a safe, clean, and well
-
maintained campus.  The last time 
the school had remodernization was in 1989.  The school has be
autiful established trees that border most sides of the 
playground.  The playground and playground equipment meet the needs of primary and upper grade students.  All 
playgrounds received modernization in the fall of 2003.  Students in our ecology club also
 
raised money to have a serenity 
garden added to the campus.
 
 
The school has a cafeteria, office, staff workroom, staff lounge, library, and computer lab.  Every classroom has at least 
three computers which have Internet capabilities.
 
 
The YMCA has a 
portable building located on the east side of the school.  The YMCA works with the district to provide 
before and after school child care for parents.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Quartz Hill Elementary 
School offers numerous opportunities for parental involvement.  We have many parents and 
community members who choose to volunteer in classrooms. These volunteers assist with academic activities such as 
listening to students read, preparing materials for t
he teacher, assisting with special events, and supporting the teacher 
according to the classroom needs.  Our PTA offers volunteer opportunities for parents and community members. 
Members of the PTA work to support classroom instruction and provide extra cu
rricular activities on the Quartz Hill 
campus through fundraising.  School Site Council offers parents an opportunity to provide input when the school is making 
decisions regarding it's instructional programs that it offers. Parents that are not native Eng
lish speakers are able to attend 
ELAC and Family Latino Literacy meetings. Parents that attend the ELAC and Family Latino Literacy meetings learn 
additional strategies on how to assist their students more effectively at home, learn about school events, and
 
have an 
opportunity to ask questions in their native language. The counselor at Quartz Hill also provides a  weekly parenting class 
which allows parents to learn parenting strategies and discuss family issues in a group setting.

A range of academic and social emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to individual 
school sites, tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these 
supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
based), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical education teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist s
tudents experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges, those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special classes and/or recommending specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for stu
dents with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
exceptional needs.
 
 
Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs and services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for 
threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
letters) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that are nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDT
PE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs include specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organiz
ation of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community outreach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a cadre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide soci
al emotional support and structure for students during more unstructured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members collaborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination 
of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The district continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for el
igible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional support staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assi
stants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of strategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic programs supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation 
during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.

Several programs, designed to build students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social deci
sion making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture continue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergarten through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5
, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addition to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  Th
ese online interventions are site
-
specific.
 
 
A variety of extended learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for 
collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review of foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summ
er intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to signi
ficant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purchased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The K
its contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and support reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCamp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for inco
ming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergarten expectations in a 
day camp

The goal of professional learning is to provide staff 
members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key area of focus for professional development and support for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particularly common formative assess
ment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staff, and site administrators are provided four days of professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.  For all groups, two of the 
days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
administrators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to use data, particularly forma
tive assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devoted a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Physical Education; and meeting 
t
he academic needs of students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Teachers are also encouraged to engage in optional professional learning opportunities that relate to their specific 
teaching assignment. Teachers are compensated at a contractual hourly rate for their
 
participation in these sessions.
 
 
Similar opportunities are provided for our site administrators.  Most regularly attend applicable ACSA Academies.  70% of

five years of teaching experience.   The 
district has developed a robust system for new teacher support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a mentor/coach dependent upon t
heir credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teachers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by their mentor/coach with the 
focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrators/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and the 
requirements of the C
TC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
upon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by teachers on special assign
ment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTPs). For veter
an teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
