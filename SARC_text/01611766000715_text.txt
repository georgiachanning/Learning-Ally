School Description
 
Tom Maloney Elementary School is a wonderfully diverse learning community located in the 
beautiful Glenmoor area of Fremont.  The school population of approximately 600 students is 
composed of many dif
ferent races and cultures.  We pride ourselves in building acceptance, 
creating environments where culture is valued, and recognizing that our differences make us 
stronger.  Our teachers are at the forefront of cutting edge instructional strategies impleme
nted 
through their work as collaborative communities . They also demonstrate a deep understanding of  
Common Core Standards, and how to incorporate them into everyday practice.  This is evident 
through the adoption of Math Expressions and Springboard Math 
in 2016, and the 2018 adoption 
of a new Language Arts curriculum, Benchmarks.  Teachers consistently work towards improving 
student outcomes, and refuse to accept failure.  This is evident in our schools achievement on the 
California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress, scoring well above the state average 
for students meeting or exceeding standards.  More importantly, you can observe our successes in 
the smiles you see on each of our students' faces.  Our school truly puts students FIRST in ever
ything 
we do!
 
 
Tom Maloney Elementary School's Mission:  At Tom Maloney Elementary School our mission is to 
educate, inspire, and empower each other.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Inst
ructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are pres
enting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our main building was built in 1962.  We added a new library and a computer lab in the mid 1990s.  Along with our main buildi
ng we also have five 
portables.  All of our 
portables are in good condition.  In the summer of 2004, we had our turf redone and added new play structures in the intermed
iate, 
primary and kindergarten playground areas.  In the summer of 2005, we had major renovations throughout the school, in classro
oms, the office, and 
multiuse rooms.  In the summer of 2006

2007, we had a new parking area put in and the old area redone to accommodate student drop
-
off and pick
-
up.  We have two areas outside for eating (weather permitting), one by the multipurpose room
 
and one in a courtyard. We have repaired/replaced 
blacktop in all three play areas during the summer of 2015. During the summer of 2016, all classroom floors were replaced as 
part of an asbestos 
abatement project.  Maloney has updated our technology by pu
tting in wireless access points throughout the school, and a new PA and clock system 
during the summer of 2018. A new phone system was installed in the fall of the 2019
-
2020 school year.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent expe
rts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilities 

ions you see on this report.  
Please not
e that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those condition
s may have changed.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Invo
lvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parental involvement is crucial to the every 
day operations at Maloney Elementary School.  We have many ways for parents to participate in the daily 
routine of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running smoothly.  Parents can join our School Site Coun
cil (SSC), which works 
with
 
administration to help make financial decisions to enhance our programs for the students by providing input to our school pla
n.  This group meets 
once a month.  Parents of English Learners are vital to our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to
 
our outreach efforts on behalf of new 
families.  The ELAC meets five times a year to assist with the allocation of LCAP funding.  We host Back to School Night in t
he fall for parents to become 
familiar with the school, meet their child's teachers, and bet
ter understand classroom expectations in regards to curriculum and behavior. We also host 
an Open House every spring to celebrate our students hard work, and connect with families in a fun setting.  Parent volunteer
s are always welcome and 
help with specia
l projects in the classroom, chaperoning field trips, working with small groups of students supported by the classroom teache
r, and even 
correcting and file assignments.
 
 
The PTA is a very important part of our school community.  It sponsors many different
 
activities, such as campus beautification days, when parents come 
on weekends to maintain our school grounds; funding technology, which provides access to computer programs such as Accelerate
d Reader; and evening 
events for families to come together and s
hare in fun activities with their children.  We invite all parents to attend school activities during the day or 

we encourage our p
arents 
to volunteer, and participate.  They are always looking for  new volunteers!
 
 
If you would like to become involved, contact the principal at (510) 797
-
4426 or Angie Andersen, the school secretary, at (510) 797
-
4426.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.

School Safety Plan
 
Staff members monitor the stu
dents and the school grounds before and after school as well as at all recesses. We have noon supervisors to monitor 
morning snack, lunch periods, and lunch recess.  The staff regularly reviews the rules for safety and responsible behavior in
 
class and on 
the playgrounds.  
Every year in the first week of school, the principal has grade level meetings to review all rules and expectations.  At Back
 
to School Night the teachers 
review classroom and school rules with parents so all parties involved have a full 
understanding of what it means to be a Maloney Bulldog.  All visitors 
must sign in at the school office, and put on a visitor or volunteer badge before going to any area on the campus.  Any paren
t needing to pick up their 
child before the school day is ove
r must come in to the office to check the student out. At the end of the day, all parents must wait at the front of the 
school until the dismissal bell rings. Parents are then welcome to pick up students at the classroom or wait for students to 
come to the
 
front of the school 
for pick

up.
 
 
The safety plan was reviewed and revised in August 2019, and presented to all staff at the August 26, 2019 staff meeting.  An
 
updated plan was approved 
August 2019 to ensure the best practices are being utilized in emerge
ncy situations.  Staff members go over procedures with their classes and in grade
-
level meetings for students.  The principal ensures that these are practiced regularly.  The plan includes procedures for all
 
emergencies and disasters, 
discipline policy, an
d school board policies.  The plan is available in the office for parents to review, and is reviewed with the School Site Cou
ncil (SSC).  
We practice four types of disaster drills during the year.  Fire drills, Earthquake Drills, and Lock
-
down Drills are p
racticed monthly.  At the beginning of 
each school year, the staff runs through a full evacuation drill to help prepare for major incidents. Our Safety Committee go
es over any areas of concern 
and gives updates and training on emergency preparedness.  Many
 
staff members, including the principal, are trained in CPR and first aid, and the school 
offers on site training for all interested staff.  At the beginning of each year, our Safety committee makes sure each class 
has water and food in all 
classrooms for 
emergencies.  We have an emergency cargo bin on the school grounds that holds our emergency supplies.  The safety committee g
oes 
through this yearly, and we are continuously adding to our supplies.  The school nurse ensures that all students with health 
pr
oblems have a health plan

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take s
ome time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach.  Below is the a
mount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
