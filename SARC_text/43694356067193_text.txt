About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearin
g on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, 
are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the Californ
ia State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted 
according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in Sept
ember 2018 about the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The Calif
ornia State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review materials
 
in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017
 
public meeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, 
so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district a
re classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cedar Grove Elementary School was originally constructed in 1969. School facilities were recently upgraded with the construct
ion of a new campus 
featuring multi
-
level new buildings. The chart displays 
the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Cedar Grove Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has ado
pted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. B
asic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

 
custodial 
staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

ith heavy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to
 
ensure that school grounds 
and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issu
es arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given 
the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program 
provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electric
al 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided sch
ool districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declinin
g state revenues, the Evergreen School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good repair.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
S
marter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligi
ble students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

, during recess, and after 
school by 
teachers and administrators. Lunch supervision is provided by noon

s badge at all times during their stay on school grounds. There is also a designated 
area for student drop
