School Description
 
Hope is one of nine elementary schools in the Carlsbad Unified School district in coastal North County 
San Diego. The campus includes 36 
classrooms, five workrooms, a cafeteria, a library, a multipurpose 
room, and a computer lab with Internet access. There are also two classrooms for before
-
school and 
after school daycare. Hope School serves students in kindergarten through fifth grade who 
come from a 
variety of home situations. Our K

5 programs also include three specialized classroom for autistic 
students and we work in cooperation with the North Coastal Consortium for Special Education. The Hope 
Elementary faculty demonstrates a high degr
ee of professionalism and dedication. The teaching staff 
includes teachers with experience ranging from 1 to 38 years. Teachers actively serve in leadership roles 
as grade
-
level leaders, site committee chairpersons, district team members, and mentors. Our 
professional learning community collaborates to carefully analyze student data, coordinate effective 
instructional strategies, and create a learning environment that addresses the needs of students. Our 

arned them the respect of our students and families. 
Students and staff benefit from the active participation of our parents and the local community. Parents 
demonstrate their commitment to our school by supporting programs that compliment our standards
-
ba
sed curriculum, such as Science Day activities, Family Science Night, literature, and character
-
building 
assemblies, and an active room
-
parent program. We take great pride in our campus. Students and 
families enjoy the inviting outdoor environment. A natur
e preserve surrounds our campus and provides 
daily sightings of hawks, our mascot, circling in the bright sky. As a community school, Hope Elementary 
is host to many community events such as scout meetings, athletic practices and competitions, dramatic 
pro
ductions, and music lessons. Our comprehensive educational program addresses all academic 
standards, including art, music, and movement/exercise classes every week. Students access technology 
within their instructional day with all classes in grades first 
through fifth grade enjoying 1
-
1 chromebook 
access. Reading is emphasized by means of weekly visits to our library. Students and staff at Hope School 
are justifiably pleased with their academic achievement and designation as a California Gold Ribbon 
School
 
in 2016 and one of only 4 schools in San Diego to win the State's Exemplary Arts Award in 2016.  
We also are the first Carlsbad Unified School to receive a SunWise Protection from the federal 
government for our Sun Safety program. Through the combined eff
orts of our dedicated staff, motivated 
students, and involved parents, Hope Elementary School has maintained a reputation for academic 
excellence.
 
 
The mission of Hope Elementary, an interactive community school, is to ensure the development of 
motivated, 
confident, and cooperative problem solvers through an academically challenging curriculum 
facilitated by a dedicated staff.

comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system 
that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, 
course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school 
district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

We invite parents to participate in the School Site Council, the PTA, the parent foundation, the room parent program, and the
 
classroom. Parents attend 
Back

Scho
ol Night and special PTA activity events such as Family Art Night, Movie Night, Family Science Night, and Open House. Parent 
volunteers 
show their community involvement and support through the number of hours they volunteer at Hope Elementary

more than 8,0
00 hours for school, 
classroom, and PTA
-
related activities. We could not do everything on campus without the help of our parents! Our academic success is based, in p
art, on 
the parents who read with students every day and manage small

group instruction. Th
e PTA raises over $72,000 in donations each year to provide 
classroom enrichment, fine arts classroom programs, and special activities for Hope Elementary students, staff, and parents.

ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our psychologist and site administrators are trained in threat assessment
 
techniques by expe

hazards. We have 
also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire, earthquake, and secure cam

Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the learning needs of the stud
ents in their class, teachers 
differentiate based on these learning needs and they collaborate with grade level team teachers as we
ll as the principal to ensure students progress at 
every level.  Beyond the general education classroom, some of our students have Learning Center support, and we host three Sp
ecial Day Classrooms, 
and GUIDE counseling. Our foundation pays for 180 hours of
 
small group reading intervention instruction as well as various intervention tools.
