School Description
 
We are pleased to share our annual Accountability Report Card for Charles Helmers Elementary 
School.  Charles Helmers Elementary 
School is the academic home of approximately 675 students 
and a staff of 70 adults who come together daily to implement our vision of excellence in 
elementary education.  Our goal is to provide a nurturing, well
-
rounded education that meets the 
academic, s
ocial, and physical needs of our students and create a unique opportunity for all 
students to gain and apply 21st
-

-
 
Critical Thinking, 
Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity.
 
 
We believe that a positive part
nership among home, school, and community enables our students 
to become socially responsible citizens who contribute to a rapidly changing and culturally diverse 

 
pride 
and a sense of family resonate throughout the campus.  High academic and Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support (PBIS) standards are embedded in the care and support that encourages 
each child to achieve personal bests.  As a result, Helmers has
 
been named a California 
Distinguished School five times and a National Blue Ribbon School and most recently a California 
Gold Ribbon School.  Our mission statement expresses our intent: Helmers Elementary School is 
committed to the development of a strong
 
community of lifelong learners, decision
-
makers, and 
persons of character.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
