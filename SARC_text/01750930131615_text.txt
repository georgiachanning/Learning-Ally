Amador Elementary serves students!  At Amador we work in teams: student 
teams, leadership teams, teacher teams, 
grade level teams, office teams, safety teams, and community teams, just to name a few. We work together 
interdependently to achieve common goals.  We offer a program that values relationships. Our lessons for studen
ts 
are steeped in Rigor and Relevance. We work together to ensure that all of us are building for the future and that 
our students will be college and career ready.
 
 
We are a five year old school with enrollment approaching 1040 students:  which includes 3
 
SDC classes and 38 grade 
K 
-
 
5 self
-
contained classrooms.  We are a racially and culturally diverse community and we are proud of the many 
languages, which the children and families bring to our school.  We have a dedicated staff and involved parent 
commu
nity. Amador is developing strong academic programs which support science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics. Reading, writing, and the arts serve as the foundational elements and skill sets that students will utilize 
as they prepare for the 21st Ce
ntury.  Students will explore learning through hands
-
on experiences as they prepare 
to be the leaders, inventors, and positive contributors of our future.
 
 
Pride, integrity, and collaborative leadership have joined forces at Amador to create a progressive 
and fully inclusive 
learning environment for our entire community. Our commitment to excellence is evident in our broad range of 
programs and services. The Common Core Curriculum, Next Generation Science Standards and Technology continue 
to be a focus. Our
 
classrooms have document cameras, tablets and Interactive SMART boards/screens for classroom 
instruction and student learning. Classrooms in all grades are using Chromebooks  and Google Applications to 
enhance student learning in math, science, social stu
dies, writing, and reading. All classrooms have student 
computers. Our Kindergarten program uses IPads. In addition, Amador's staff and parents are committed to a strong 
character
-
development program. We celebrate life skills in our classrooms through our 
Capturing Kids Hearts, 
Kimochi's, and Habitute programs.
 
 
Our staff, students, and families have joined together to ensure that all children have the skills, resources, 
knowledge, and experiences to prepare them for the future.  In classrooms, on the playg
round, and in our global 
community we want our students to value diversity and to be inclusive leaders, problem solvers, pursuers of 
knowledge, effective communicators, and creative thinkers. Our goal is for our  students to become compassionate, 
ethical, 
and inquisitive global citizens. To fulfill this vision, Amador Elementary School focuses are aligned with 
DUSD's Organizational Goals:
 
 
1)
 
Improve Student Outcomes by ensuring every student is challenged and prepared for success in school 
and life by focusin
g on supporting a rigorous classroom environment, closing achievement and 
opportunity gaps and committing to equitable and research
-
based instructional and socio
-
emotional 
practices.
 
2)
 
Support a Highly Effective Staff by fostering a responsive, caring, inclu
sive culture, which is built upon our 
professional learning communities and an unwavering commitment to robust recruitment, hiring, 
development, and retention practices.
 
3)
 
Ensure Effective Resource Allocation and Efficient Systems of Operation by championing
 
the needs of our 
school communities and being responsible stewards of the public's investment as our community rapidly 
grows.
 
 
Given these commitments, the Amador Elementary team participates in many site and district level committees.  
Some of these incl
ude: Professional Learning Communities (PLC), NGSS 
-
 
Science,  English Language Arts, Science, 
and Math Curricula Councils, Technology, and Safety Committees.  The measurable academic student gains observed 
at Amador Elementary School are the result of the
se collaborative professional efforts and life
-
long learning practices 
of our staff. Our school have been honored as a National Unity School as well as the past three year recipients of the 
Educational Results Partnership Honor Roll awards.
 
 
We are a dedic
ated staff and involved parent community. We are working on creating our School Mission Statement 
this year as a new school collectively. Our underlying philosophy is the belief that all children can learn, that our 
teaching is powerful, and that strong, p
roven instructional practices can make a profound difference in the lives of 
our children.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose our textbooks from lists th
at have already been approved by the state education officials. For more than six years, panels of scholars have 
decided what California students should learn and be able to do. Their decisions are known as the California Content Standard
s, and they apply 
to all 
public schools in the state. The textbooks we use and the test we give are based on these content standards, and we expect ou
r teachers to be firmly 
focused on them.
 
 
All students have their own set of textbooks to use in class or at home, many are 
offered digitally.
 
 
The elementary, kindergarten to grade 5, English
-
Language Arts textbooks are from the 2002 adoption list not the most recent 2008 adoption list. During 
the current financial situation, districts have been given the flexibility to use St
ate funds for textbooks for other needs as approved by the local School 
Board. This flexibility allows districts to continue to use materials from the previous adoption list and still meet the requ
irement of having the most recent 
state
-
approved materials.
 
Therefore, while our materials for K
-
5 English
-
 
Language Arts are not from the most recent state
-
approved list, we are still 
compliant with State regulations.

School Facility Conditions and Planned I
mprovements (Most Recent Year)
 
This is Amador Elementary's fourth year. It is state of the art in its construction. Classrooms are linked internally to supp
ort
 
grade level collaboration 
between students and staff. Furniture is on wheels. This offers teachers/students the ability to rearrange learning environme
nts to the desired groups 
quickly for lessons.  Student chairs encourage student movement and tracking. 
Cafe tables offer places where students can stand and work. Soft seating 
and hallway tables  expand traditional learning spaces. Outdoor seating areas and stages with WiFi, both inside and outside, 
creates new learning spaces. 
Two flexible classrooms have 
been converted into classrooms this year but it is our hopes to not fill them next year for they offer areas to work through 
messy science labs or art lessons for any teacher to use. We have one full
-
time day custodian, a part time custodian, and an evenin
g custodial team who 
clean all classrooms and all restrooms each day. District maintenance regularly maintains landscaping and larger maintenance 
projects.
 
 
The library, which holds a 1:17 book ratio for each student, is one of the most extensive elementar
y school libraries in Dublin. It also holds student tablets 
for research and digital media along with an expansive seating area. It offers a 2/3 non
-
fiction and 1/3 fiction library collection. We update the collection 
each year after doing a collection ana
lysis and aligning our needs with the state and school library standards. The library/media technician works on 
maintaining and improving our book collection, reading stories to classes, and circulating books to each class on a weekly ba
sis. The library is
 
open five 
days a week during school hours.

Teachers instruct their students to use technology effectively.  We have moved to a Google Classroom format where learning is
 
interactive, shared, and 
built upon. Our vision is for students to become proficient 
with technology as a tool so that it is used often in their day and deepens student learning. 
Students use multimedia to show evidence of learning. They use the Internet for research and web
-
based programs and resources to enhance the 
curriculum. All class
rooms have teacher
-
networked computers, Chromebooks for all students with a ratio of 1:1, and one networked printer. Teachers 
use computers to correspond with students, colleagues and parents via email and to access the Internet. All classrooms have d
ocume
nt cameras, 
interactive SMART Boards or 80 inch monitors, voice enhancing systems,  and Chromebooks. Our Kindergarten classrooms have iPa
ds. We have several 
web
-
based services connected to our adopted Textbook series which support students at home and at s
chool. We also use others such as Google 
applications, IXL, STARFALL, Accelerated Reader, and Brainpop  just to name a few, to enhance and assess student learning. Ma
ny of these programs 
support math concepts and reading comprehension and students find the
m motivating.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school bui
lding components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

School Safety 
Plan
 
Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is a top priority. Students 
learn best in a safe, nurturing environment. The Amador School Safety Plan 
is in place.  We annually update and revise the plan, which is based on the 
Safety Emergency Management S
ystem each year. Our plan includes 
procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency 
supplies. We share and monitor the plan with all staff during staff meetings 
throughout the year. This plan has been expanded into a Comprehensive 
Scho
ol Safety Plan. A copy of this safety plan  is available to view in our 
school office.
 
 
Our students and staff receive training in Intruder, fire and earthquake 
drills on a monthly basis. Our buildings and classrooms are locked.  We 
participate in county w
ide earthquake drills such as "The Great Shake Out." 
We use debriefing sessions after drills to gather input to improve on our 
safety procedures. Each classroom has emergency backpacks containing a 
variety of first aid materials and guardian and health inf
ormation. Each 
student has an emergency bag, stored at school, with supplies to be used 
in case of an emergency. In addition, we have a safety storage container 
that holds supplies, water and safety/comfort kits for all students in the 
event of an emergenc
y.
 
 
We have school
-
wide assemblies and activities on safety issues, including 
fire safety, drug and alcohol prevention (DARE/Red Ribbon Celebrations), 
conflict management, bullying, sexual harassment, and tobacco
-
free 
environments. We are a Bully
-
Free comm
unity.  We communicate and 
reinforce safety and student management through the student and parent 
handbooks, school and classroom rules, and assemblies. Parents learn 
about safety procedures in weekly bulletins and monthly letters, at parent 
meetings, and 

 
 
Visitors must enter the school through the main door and sign in at the 

We screen all volunteers before they are allowed to volunteer in our 
classrooms. A
 
trained campus security officer and assigned teachers and 
staff monitor the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school, 
as well as at all recesses and at lunchtime. Teachers regularly review the 
rules for safe and responsible behavior in school
 
and on the playground.
 
 
Our Comprehensive School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and 
discussed with the school faculty in August/ September 2019 and 
approved by our School Site Council, District Office, and a Dublin Police 
School Resource Officer 
in September/October 2019.

O
pportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Amador Elementary School, staff, students, and parents collaborate for success. We have a wonderfully active parent commun
ity and our parent 
volunteerism is high. Volunteers have dedicated many
 
hours in numerous activities that support the curriculum and student success.  Teachers encourage 
parents to assist in their classroom and work directly with students in support of their learning once trained.
 
 
We have many ways for parents to participate
 
in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running smoothly. Parents can 
join our School Site Council, which works with the principal, assistant principal and staff members to help make financial de
cisions that support the 
School 
Plan
 
for Student Achievement. Our School Site Council (SSC) has also spearheaded a Community Celebration Awareness Program. We are
 
a "salad bowl" 
of diversity in our community and we believe that understanding each other's celebrations will help use u
nite as a school culture and have deeper 
appreciations of each other.  We host our Multicultural Talent Show in December and coordinate multicultural assemblies throu
ghout the year.  These 
assemblies are generously funded by our Parent Faculty Club (PFC) a
nd ASB Fundraiser. A representative on our SSC attends our PFC meetings to support 
communication between the two parent groups. Our PFC also coordinates our Art in Action program that all student learn and pa
rticipate in each year 
at our school. Our PFC al
so support all grade levels in attending a performing art theatre expereicne yearly.   In addition, our PFC supports our Room
 
Parents who organize parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and chaperon on field trips.  Our PFC h
elps 
our school raise 
significant capital through fund
-
raising events to support student and school programs while our SSC oversees the expenditure of the funds and approves 
our 
School Plan
 
for Student Success (SPSA). Parents of English learners are vital to ou
r English Language Advisory Committee and to our outreach efforts 
on behalf of new families. We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to 
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spring, and parent
-
teacher conferences in 
November. The administration and staff 
have an "open door" policy when it comes to meeting with our parents at all times throughout the school year. 
We feel collaboration is essential to offer the kind of learning opportunities to students that we do at Amador!

Dedicated staff development days are scheduled on the school
-
year calendar during the negotiation process between the District and the teachers 
association. Content for two of the three days is usually determined by the District based 
on areas of focus, Common Core Standards, Professional 

f input as well, typically through 
surveys. Teachers and administrators also
 
review test scores of the previous year. The third staff development day is determined in collaboration between 
the staff and principal. We use a needs survey to gather teacher and staff input for suggestions. Each site plans their teach
er training based 
on needs 
identified in their site plan, such as finding ways to narrow our student achievement gaps and working with at
-
risk students.
 
 
In addition, teachers and administrators have also participated in training from the Association of California School Ad
ministrators, California Reading 
Association, California Mathematics Association, National Council of Mathematics Teachers, Association of Supervision and Cur

leased through use of 
substitutes to attend workshops or
 
conferences, at district sponsored after school workshops, during grade level collaboration, and via district

based 
coaches.
 
 
Staff development includes, but is not limited to: The new adoption of curriculum materials for ELA (Benchmark Advance), Resp
