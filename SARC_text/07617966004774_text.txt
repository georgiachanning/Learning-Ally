By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card
 
(SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Pla
n (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCA
P, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
princi
pal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Grant Elementary School was built in 1956 and is located in the city of Richmond along the 23rd St. corridor. The school is 
located on Downe
r Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets. Grant is a Title I school with 100% free and reduced lunch Our 
student population is largely Latino, with 66% English Language Learners. Grant has had several facility improvements this 
past year. Grant Elementary ha
s 570 students from Pre
-
school through 6th grade.
 
 
Staff and parents at Grant Elementary work together to create and provide a safe environment which is conducive to 
learning and developing academic and social skills. Together we strive for our students to
 
become life
-
long learners and 
productive citizens. We feel strongly that it is important to address all of the needs of the child. We share a belief that o
ur 
children deserve to be prepared so that they are ready and able to pursue any career or life path
 
they choose when they 
grow up. Our teachers have become GLAD Certified in order to provide the best learning opportunities for all learners. We 
are robustly implementing the Common Core State Standards in our TK through 6th grade program. We also offer ma
ny 
opportunities for parents to provide input and receive information. There are monthly SSC , ELAC, and APPAC meetings, 
Informational Coffees, parent workshops, parent
-
teacher conferences, assemblies, and messages on ClassDojo and social 
media to keep par
ents informed and involved. Our School Community Worker helps to support our families with any 
educationally related concerns and connect families to community resources to address other concerns they may need 
assistance with.
 
 
Grant is an RTI2 school, whi
ch means we offer both academic and behavioral support to all students. The Grant community 
also respects and celebrates the diverse backgrounds of its parents and students. Our Learning Center provides pull
-
out 
support for students who need more specializ
ed instruction and we also offer push
-
in support to classrooms where our 
data shows the need. We offer differentiated instruction in all subject areas to provide support for individual learning 
styles while maintaining high, attainable expectations for stu
dents. Intervention programs have also been added to target 
learning gaps for our struggling students. Study trips are arranged by teachers to enhance student learning and give them 
real world applications. In addition, we have a large after
-
school program
 
which supports the core subjects and provides 
a variety of extracurricular activities to enrich the lives of our students.
 
 
We have had many initiatives for behavioral support as part of our RTI2 model. Three years ago, Multi
-
tiered System of 
Support (MTS
S) and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), were implemented. MTSS is to support a 
process of systematically documenting the performance of students as evidence of the need for additional services after 
making changes in classroom instruc
tion. MTSS promises to change the way schools support students with learning and 
behavior problems by systematically delivering a range of interventions based on demonstrated levels of need.
 
 
MTSS is defined as "the practice of providing high
-
quality instr
uction and interventions matched to student need, 
monitoring progress frequently to make decisions about changes in instruction or goals, and applying child response data 
to important educational decisions Based on a problem
-
solving model, the MTSS approac
h considers environmental 
factors as they might apply to an individual student's difficulty, and provides services/intervention as soon as the student 
demonstrates a need. Focused primarily on addressing academic problems, allows us to think in a new way a
bout both 
disability identification and early intervention assistance for the most vulnerable, academically unresponsive children.

PBIS is based on a problem
-
solving model and aims to prevent inappropriate behavior through teaching and reinforcing 
appropri
ate behaviors. PBIS is a process that is consistent with the core principles of MTSS. PBIS offers a range of 
interventions that are systematically applied to students based on their demonstrated level of need, and addresses the 
role of the environment as i
t applies to development and improvement of behavior problems.
 
 
Both MTSS and PBIS are grounded in differentiated instruction. Each approach delimits critical factors and components to 
be in place at the universal (Tier 1), targeted group (Tier 2), and 
individual (Tier 3) levels. Our goal is to describe the shared 
characteristics of these approaches as a basis for highlighting how best to meet the needs of children experiencing 
academic and social difficulties in school. This past August, we received a P
BIS distinction at the Gold Level.
 
 
We are also teaching the tools to our parents which help them to use these skills with the children when they are at home. 
We will continue with our school

e 
Project teaches 50
-
minute pull out sessions twice per week, to groups of six to eight students in each grade level. During 
the year students are taught in eight
-
week rotations of expressive arts, yoga, and performing arts. All sessions include 
mindfulnes
s instruction that is taught on its own and is also woven into each morality. Through our partnership with 
Mindful Life, we've seen a dramatic change in the number of discipline referrals.
 
 
Last year, was the final year of a three year grant through Long 
Foundation to work with Seneca Family of Agencies. The 
grant provided our site with an Unconditional Education Coach full time. The coach was utilized to support school 
leadership to coordinate services at identifying, referring, and tracking progress of s
tudents requiring support. This year, 
by request of all stakeholders, we are using site funds to continue with this program.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the
 
school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
us
ed to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental
 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged to participate in 
the SSC, ELAC, AASAT, and PTA
-
 
as committees assisting in developing the shared 
vision and mission of the school. Parental input and participation is highly valued and appreciated by the school staff. 
Parents are also encouraged to get a district volunteer
 
badge and help in the classrooms, on study trips, and during 
lunches. In addition, Parents are invited to attend our Informational Coffees, these give parents an opportunity to speak 
in a casual setting with various experts on a variety of topics. During 
these meetings, guest presenters provide support on 
topics of concern.
 
 
In partnership with local organizations, we provide parents with opportunities to learn ways in which they can support 
their children at home with their learning. Family Math, Literacy
, and Science Nights are part of the school's tradition to 
provide parents with tools in supporting their children and becoming involved in their children's education. Other family 
fun events are planned throughout the year and parents are encouraged to pa
rticipate actively. For the convenience of 
our Spanish speaking parents, our meetings are bilingual. In addition to the above, we will use our network of Community 
Partners, to provide opportunities for our parents to gain useful information such as awaren
ess of age
-
appropriate 
disciplinary techniques, to identify important health issues in their community and enhance their own abilities to address 
these health issues with concrete solutions based on the strengths of the community. Additionally, with the as
sistance of 
our Community Engagement Office and School Community Outreach Worker, we offer Parent University and ESL courses 
for our parents. We continue our work in hosting a Father's Club. For more information, please contact our office at (510)

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coord
inated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over ti
me and those that may occur without warning.

An Unconditional Education approach will continue to be our school
-
wide focus at Grant. Unconditional Education (UE) 
model empowers the entire school community with the skills and resources required to implement a multi
-
tiered system 
of academic, behaviora
l, and social
-
emotional supports, devoting time and resources toward creating a culture and 
climate that is engaging and responsive to the needs of all students and their families. A primary focus of the UE model is 
to increase the achievement of strugglin
g students, including students with disabilities, within inclusive education settings. 
Our teachers are provided professional development opportunities that provide them with tools that allow them to serve 
the whole child. Quality instruction and instructi
onal leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To 
ensure this, the Academic Supports engage teachers, administrators and other personnel in ongoing professional 
development focused on improving teaching and learning. Our school lea
dership has sought out training to improve our 
ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at our school site. We provide support 
to our teachers through staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and pl
anning, and individual coaching 
based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site professional 
development in all standards based curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, professional develo
pment is 
provided in English Language Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), differentiated instruction and 
educational technology.
 
 
In addition, training is made available in classroom management and the effective use of assessment data and te
acher 
data teams in meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional development program is ensuring that 
all students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable 
instructio
nal leaders. Specifically, monthly professional development is planned and presented to the Grant Staff based 
on needs identified by teachers. Grade levels meet weekly and meet regularly with district coaches, principal, and vice 
principal to review data a
nd plan instruction. Teachers are encouraged to attend conferences, workshops, and training 
outside of the school day. They may also visit other schools or classrooms within Grant.

In order to best support our students' social emotional Development, our s
taff has been receiving Professional 
Development around Trauma from our Seneca Partnership. Our staff has worked closely with Seneca to complete a School 
Climate Assessment to improve our culture and climate. Teachers will continue to be supported in recei
ving training and 
maintaining positive classroom environment by implementing behavioral interventions that support students. Through a 
trauma
-
informed lens, continuous support of stakeholders, professional development, and uniform practices, we will 
prepar
e our school community in taking the proper approach in the education and development of our students. In 
addition, we will tap into all professional development opportunities provided by the Anti
-
Defamation League including 
Anti
-
Bias, Anti
-
Bullying, and A
lly Training.
