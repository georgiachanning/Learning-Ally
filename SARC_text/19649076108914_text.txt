By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

A 
Community of Scholars!
 
The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 
November 1988. The Report Card, issued annually by school boards for each public school in the state, provides for 
parents 
and other interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and areas in which 

Our sta
ff is outstanding in leadership, instructional abilities, and concern for students. Each employee at our school has 
the best interests of your children at heart. I hope you will find this report informative and beneficial. If you would like 
additional info
rmation on any of these areas, please feel free to call my office at 397

4985. I welcome your comments on 
this report!

Vejar School serves a diverse and growing population. It is our position 
that the school program reflects the goals and 
objectives of parents, staff, and the school community. Our responsibility is to provide an education that challenges our 
students academically, personally and socially. It is our belief that by enhancing the 
educational growth of students they 
will develop a commitment to personal excellence. The school was built in 2006 and both the classified and certificated 
staff work in concert to ensure a clean and safe learning environment in which to teach and learn.
 
 
Vision/Mission Statement and Goals
 
The vision of Vejar Professional Learning Community is to work together to ensure that all of our student scholars are 
critical thinkers, problem solvers and responsible citizens. Our mission is to create a school that kn
ows no limits to the 
academic success of each student and promotes an atmosphere in which students develop the desire to learn by working 
in partnership with parents, staff, and administration. Our school provides a rigorous instructional program that focu
ses 
on academic language and informational text, the 21st Century skills of Collaboration, Communication, Creativity and 
Critical Thinking that prepares students for college and/or career. Reading, Writing and Problem Solving are integrated 
throughout the 
content areas and are key goals in the SPSA. Through educational excellence we cultivate active 
engagement, enthusiasm, core values, positive behaviors, and a mindset of no excuses.
 
 
School activities promote responsibility, positive behaviors, 
confidence, respect and trustworthiness. Our PBIS (Positive 
Behavior Intervention Support) program revolves around our theme of M.A.S.K. (M for Making Good Decisions, A for 
Acting Responsibly, S for Solving Problems and K for Keeping Calm and Leading On.) 
directed towards developing citizens 
who perceive themselves as important participants in a democratic society
 

 

-
esteem, confidence, responsibility, and respect.
 

 
Promote productive citizens who are skilled communicators, problem solver
s, and critical thinkers.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the distr
ict 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Staff attended a training in 
October 
of 2018 and a disaster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. The search and 
rescue team also meet regularly. All buildings within the district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A 
discipline policy may be 
found at each school that seeks to insure a safe and orderly environment for students and staff.
 
 
At Vejar there is an Administrator headed Search and Rescue team that revise the school safety plan every year. The school 
conducts monthly fire drills and fo
ur disaster drills a year to ensure that Vejar students are safe under any situation.
 
 
Vejar School has a discipline plan and code of conduct, developed by administration, teachers, parents and students, and 
is distributed to each parent at the beginning o
f every school year. The school has a code of conduct that is consistent 
with the California Education Code and contains rules and regulations regarding student discipline. Students who violate 
school rules may be subject to detention, suspension or expuls
ion.

as well as articulation with grade level and 
department colleagues to enhance instruction and assessment.   These focus areas are in direct alignment with federal, 
state, and district student achievement academic goals. In ad

sites use their weekly late start Friday sessions, 2 additional hours per month, and 4 additional hours per year (once per 
semester), to analyze student achievement data in a collegial forum. They 
then design effective instructional interventions 


 

School Plan

as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, the essential components of
 
the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/support instruction and learning. Perform
