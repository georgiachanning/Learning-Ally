By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Thomas Edison Mission Statement:  Thomas Edison Elementary School is a safe and nurturing community, committed to 
working collaboratively to ensure achievement for all students in the areas of academics, social
-
emo
tional wellbeing, and 
physical education. We are a learning community of families, students, and staff committed to excellence. We are 
dedicated to building respectful, responsible citizens and to creatively and authentically empower all students to become
 
independent, self
-
motivated learners.
 
 
School Description:  Thomas Edison School is located in a quiet neighborhood on the west side of Daly City and serves 
approximately 415 students in pre
-
school through sixth grade. The campus consists of three main bu
ildings with lovely 
grass areas in the center of each quad. We have a large playground and field where students play and participate in 
physical education classes daily.
 
 
All classrooms have internet access along with our library and 3 computer labs on whe
els. Thomas Edison was the first 
school in the district to institute a uniform policy that helps maintain a focus on education and promotes equity among 
our students. The school has an experienced staff of credentialed teachers who continue to work to rais
e student 
achievement regardless of linguistic, ethnic or economic background. Thomas Edison has an extra teacher on staff who 
helps ensure that our English Language Learners and students who are not meeting their academic benchmarks can 
receive small grou
p instruction.
 
 
All students participate in the program Soul Shoppe to learn about conflict management, how to be a responsible citizens 
and community building.  Kindergarten through Fifth Grade participate in the Music for Minors program which culminates 
in classroom performances. Thomas Edison has implemented the Positive Behavior Intervention Support program during 
the 2016 
-
 
2017 school year.  Our students know our three expectations:  Be Responsible, Be Respectful, Be Safe.  We have 
monthly PBIS assemb
lies to review school norms.  Students earn "Caught Being Good" awards and classrooms earn the 
Eye of the Tiger Awards. We have a half
-
time counselor on site to meet with at
-
risk youth individually, in small groups and 
with whole classes.
 
 
We strive to mak
e Thomas Edison a place where students are eager to come every day and successful with their academic 
goals. Thomas Edison is a school wide Reading Log School with all students reading for 20
-
30 minutes a night and 
completing a common log.  Students also h
ave the expectation of completing a summer reading assignment. Thomas 
Edison School will work in partnership with parents/guardians and the community to provide an excellent educational 
program in a safe and caring environment that promotes lifelong learni
ng and responsible citizenship.  In 2019 we received 
the PBIS Platinum Award.  In addition we received an Honor Roll School Award in 2018
-
2019 and the 2019 California State 
Distinguished School Award. We are very proud of our wonderful school.
 
 
The 
SARC is available on the district website at www.jsd.k12.ca.us and can be made available in hard copy upon request.

Thomas Edison encourages the involvement and support of our parent community. We believe that only through working 
together can we truly make a difference for our student's. Thomas Edison has a very active Parent Teacher Organization 
(PTO), School Site Cou
ncil and ELAC groups that work with the school to improve the quality of education for our students. 
Our parent groups support Thomas Edison by participating in parent education, the decision making process, and 
volunteering in different capacities at the 
school. Our PTO funds our music program and various classroom activities.  
Parents run a Weekly Wednesday Workshop, where they help teachers and school staff prepare for upcoming events and 
lessons and a monthly parent/community event . Parents and familie

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety is a high priority here at Thomas Edison. Students need a safe and secure environment in order to learn properly.  
At Thomas Edison we strive to provide such an environment so that our students feel safe, secure, happy and encouraged 
to do their bes
t.
 
 
Thomas Edison staff, along with our School Site Council reviewed and updated our comprehensive safety plan in 
November of 2020. The plan was then reviewed with a member of the Daly City Police Department. Parents received 
information about key points o
f the plan. The plan is located in the central office for parents to read.
 
 
Thomas Edison holds monthly emergency drills to ensure that the students understand how to react in the event of 
different kinds of emergencies. Each staff member has an emergency 
backpack with first aid supplies, student emergency 
information and a walkie
-
talkie. Each classroom has a bin with emergency supplies for the students.

We believe that clearly communicated expectations for behavior is essential for a safe school environme
nt. Students and 
parents receive the school behavioral expectations. Students are reminded of these policies at an assembly and within 
their classrooms. "Caught Being Good" slips are handed out to reinforce positive behavior. Classrooms can receive the 
"Ey
e of the Tiger" weekly prize for good citizenship. All students know our three expectations, Respect, Responsibility and 
Safety.
 
 
Monthly mini
-
assemblies are held to reinforce the behavior expectations. All students participate in Soul Shoppe to learn 
how to become good citizens and how to manage conflicts, classes also receive character education classes presented by 
our school counselor.
 
 
Constant supervision on campus is handled by our noon supervisors, physical education aides, teachers, staff and p
rincipal.
 
 
All visitors are required to stop by the office and get clearance through our Raptor online system and receive a visitors 
badge.

Thomas Edison has participated in the district staff development 
opportunities for both classified and certificated staff. 
Our focus has been on the implementation of Math and English Language Arts Curriculum. Thomas Edison works with the 
district ELA and Math coaches to ensure proper implementation.  Every Wednesday ou
r students are dismissed at 1:43 
allowing the teachers to participate in additional professional development. The Early Release Wednesday professional 
development has focused on ELD, PLC's and data analysis, MTSS, PBIS and Inclusion Techniques and Best Pra
ctices. The 
teachers take the opportunity to visit other classrooms to observe other teaching practices. Finally, the staff at Thomas 
Edison has attended training on differentiating instruction to help meet the needs of our English Language Learners. These
 
workshops provide the teachers with ideas and tools to support, engage, and challenge the students at their individual 
level. Our Preschool and Kindergarten team along with the school administrator are part of a County Math Alignment 
Cohort. In addition, 
they participate in a PK
-
3rd grade Continuam Cohort.  Teachers receive opportunities to attend 
conferences and county trainings.  They are then expected to share their new knowledge and techniques at a future Staff 
Meeting/PD.
