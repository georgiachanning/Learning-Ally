By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
Charleston Elementary School facilities are in GOOD condition.  The school is maintained in good repair with a number of 
non
-
critical deficiencies noted in the 
FIT report.  These deficiencies are isolated and/or resulting from minor wear and tear 
and are in the process of being mitigated. Below is a list of deficiencies discovered and listed in the inspection tool.  A 
number of work orders for each deficiency hav
e been submitted and will be completed as time and funding allow. 

 
 
This facility report will list repairs completed since the last report and also list those areas which were not repaired and/
or 
additional areas discovered during the inspection that needed repair.

Structural damage:
 
Room 13 ramp railing; square tubing rusted through at corner weld and creates a risk of an injury to students or staff.  If 
left un
-
repaired, tubing will eventually
 
break free of the weld.  Room 17 Library ramp ply board side panels deteriorated 
and needing a replacement made of galvanized sheet steel.
 
 
The exterior of all building on site were painted in the summer of 2018.
 
 
Roof gutters:
 
During the  2015
-
2016 schoo
l year Charleston Elementary school year experienced some maintenance challenges during 
the very wet rainy season.  New roofs were added to rooms 12, 13, 14, and 15.  These major repairs solved problems with 
leaking roofs and gutters present with those cla
ssrooms.
 
 
Other leaking roof gutters that were treated with a spray
-
on material to cover holes began to leak again well into the wet 
season.  The following gutters need complete replacement:  rooms 3 and 4 on the south side of Building B, rooms 6 and 7 
on 
the north and south sides of Building C.  These locations have again been included in the FIT report and have not been 
fixed.
 
 
Playground / School grounds
 
In 2016, action was taken to replace portions of the existing playground structure and new 
equipment items were 
approved and installed in late June / early August 2016. However, our play structure is still functional, but will need to be
 
replaced in the near future.
 
 
The parking lot in the front of the school that was showing damage such as hole
s, depressions and uneven surfaces was 
repaired in July 2019.  New concrete was poured covering the north half of our parking lot, but the south half will need to 
be repaired/replaced in the near future.
 
 
Windows/ Doors/ Gates / Fences:
 
Another deficiency 
listed in this year's report is window coverings in classrooms. These are vertical blinds and screens 
which are not adequate due to damage from age and wear.  The vertical blinds need to be able to completely block the 
view of the inside of the room from t
he outside in a lock
-
down situation to prevent intruders (shooters) from seeing 
potential targets (students, staff, parents).  The following rooms need window blind replacement:  classrooms 5, 10, 12, 
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.  Screen repairs
 
in the following rooms:  5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 22.  Well fitting, 
undamaged screens are in compliance with the state's IPM practices for excluding pests.
 
 
Overall, Charleston Elementary School is in GOOD condition.  With the help of our district 
and our parent club, we have 
been able to keep our school maintained and looking very nice.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not;
 
however, the number of students tested

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Charleston Elementary is committed to providing a safe learning environment. The School Safety/Leadership Committee 
meets regularly to review safety issues and recommended 
improvements. School suspensions, vandalism, and crime are 
reported monthly to the district office. Monthly drills including fire and lock
-
down drills are performed to ensure all 
students, staff and parents are prepared in the case of an emergency. An eart
hquake drill is also performed each year in 
the month of October.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  A public meeting takes place on site each year to allow 
members of the community an opportunity to provide input regarding the saf
ety of our school. The public meeting will 
take place this year on October 15, 2019 at Charleston Elementary.  The Comprehensive Safety Plan will be reviewed for 
approval by School Site Council members, community members, and law enforcement officials who 
at this meeting.  The 
Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed by the school board annually as well.

The Comprehensive Safety Plan is available in our main office.  All staff at Charleston Elementary is knowledgeable of the 
Comprehensive Safety Plan and the 
District Disaster Plan components.   In addition, each classroom is equipped with an 
emergency lock
-
down kit, emergency backpack, and laminated step
-
by
-
step instructions containing information about 
emergency procedures.  This information can be found next
 
to the door in every classroom.  All teachers are also provided 

 
 
There are two full time custodians who take great pride in making sure the clas
srooms and campus are clean, safe, and 
well maintained at all times.  The Head Custodian and the Principal perform a Facilities Inspection every year in September 
to look for any items that need to be replaced, repaired, or updated.  The Facilities Inspect
ion provides us with a school 
rating on the condition of our school.  Ratings are either poor, fair, good, or exemplary condition.  Work orders are also 
submitted with the report to repair or replace items that are in poor condition.  This year 2019
-
2020 o
ur Facility Inspection 
resulted in an overall school rating of GOOD.  The Facilities Inspection report  is submitted to the District Office each yea
r.
 
 
In addition, the County Fire Marshall performs an annual inspection of our school site and 
provides a detailed report of 
the inspection including items that require immediate attention.  The report also includes fire codes and other rules and 

available in the school 
office.  The County fire inspection occurred on June 12, 2019.  No visible violations were noticed at the time of inspection.
 
 
A safety assessment was conducted by "Knowledge Saves Lives Incorporated" in September of 2018.  Many fac
tors are 
evaluated when determining the threat potential of a school facility including but not limited to building egress, room 
capacity, and current safety protocols.  FEMA outlines several areas to be evaluated regarding risk assessments.  They are 
refe
rred to as Potential Threat Elements or PTE's.  PTE's provide a baseline for evaluation.  Potential Threat Elements 
include: terrorism, violent crime, sabotage, rioting, natural disaster.  Final recommendations were given by KSL 
Incorporated to understand 
and recognize potential threats in order to create an action plan to address such incidents.
 
 
Overall, Charleston Elementary is a very safe campus.

Based on our 2018 CAASPP math results, it was determined that math will be our primary focus for professional 
development this 
year.  All certificated staff members are participating in the current math initiative with Math Solutions.  
Math Solutions is currently providing professional development (math coaching) to our teachers 3 days/month for 6 
months during the regular day and
 
after school along with a full day of professional development on October 29, 2018 
and February 1, 2019.  Our teachers are committed to improving math instruction and strategies in order to help all 
students reach higher levels of achievement in math.
 
 
Ev
ery certificated Charleston Elementary staff member is involved in ongoing professional staff development. Our district 
has a strong commitment to provide the needed support to our staff for their professional development. Certificated staff 
members also p
articipate in weekly grade level collaboration meetings in which teachers share instructional strategies 
and look at student data.  Eight Professional Learning Community (PLC) meetings are held throughout the year to review 
benchmark data in ELA and math a
s well as to offer staff development in teaching methodologies and technology use in 
the classroom. PLC meetings are also used to help teachers plan and develop lessons for the implementation of the new 
common core state standards and develop timelines for
 
the implementation of the Interim Math and ELA assessments.
