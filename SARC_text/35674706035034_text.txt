School Description
 
R.O. Hardin Elementary School is located in the city of Hollister. Built in 1948, it is the oldest school 
site within the district. During the 2018/19 academic year there were approximately 463 students 
enrolled in Transitional Kindergarten through fifth g
rade at R.O. Hardin, with an additional 50 
preschoolers enrolled in the State and Migrant Preschool.
 
 
Collaboration among all segments of our school community is essential to the success and safety 
of our students. We actively utilize positive behavioral s
upports such as Capturing Kids Hearts. We 
also participate with local law enforcement to bring Gang Resistance Education and Training 
(G.R.E.A.T) to our fourth graders and invite and welcome parents to participate in our Parent 
Teacher Organization (PTO), 
English Learners' Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council 
(SSC). We are fortunate to have formed partnerships with the Arts Now organization, Navigator 
Schools and Hollister Youth Alliance.
 
 
Our work at R.O. Hardin is guided by research based tea
ching practices.  In our lesson designs we 
are exploring the purpose and reasoning of each lesson and students calibrating their own success.  
At R.O. Hardin we have two Support Teachers, Intervention teacher, two coaches, an Instructional 
Assistant for ev
ery two classes and one Instructional Assistant dedicated to the Transitional 
Kindergartners.  All staff on campus value collaboration and use the four critical questions at the 
heart of every Professional Learning Community. We collaborate regularly to ha
ve a better 
understanding of each grade level's essential standards, to create assessments and analyze data, 
and to plan how we will differentiate for each child. We incorporate a blended learning program 
into each of our classrooms and strive to meet and 
teach each child at his or her level. All teachers 
are committed to the highest quality and most effective standards based instruction using District 
State
-
Adopted Standards
-
Based curriculum.
 
 
Our vision for our school is that we will be a caring and chall
enging learning environment where 
students are inspired to be the best version of themselves in all areas.  To do this students will need 
to show proficiency in language and all academic areas, tolerance and empathy, perseverance, and 
problem solving skill
s. Our community works collaboratively to inspire and motivate all children to 
do their personal best.  We are creating a school culture and climate that rewards and 
acknowledges academic achievement and social responsibility.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
R.O. Hardin School, originally constructed in 1948, provides a safe, clean environment 
for students, staff, visitors, and volunteers. The site has 43 
classrooms (shared with an independent charter school), 5 sets of bathrooms, a library, a multipurpose room, a staff room, a 
playground and 3 baseball 
diamonds, and a large grass area for other
 
sports.
 
 
Safety: Students are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school.  Supervision is provided for students throughou
t the school day; the 
responsibility is shared between administrators, teachers, yard duty supervisors, and other members
 
of the school staff. The campus is enclosed by 
fencing and all visitors must go through the school office, sign in and out, and wear an identification badge while on campus
. The school is in compliance 
with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to h
azardous materials and state earthquake standards.
 
 
Cleaning: A team of three custodians ensure classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe daily.
 
 
Maintenance and repair: A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the Hollist
er School District. A work order process is utilized to ensure 
efficient service and completion of tasks in a timely manner.
 
 
Modernization:  On November 4, 2014, the voters of the Hollister School District passed Measure M, a $28.5 million Facilities
 
Bond
 
that will address the 
most critical renovation and modernization needs at the District's elementary and middle schools. In the summer of 2016, the 
R.O. Hardin buildings 
underwent a total modernization under Measure M. For a complete list and photos of the
 
R.O. Hardin project go to

education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

O
pportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
R.O. Hardin encourages parents to be actively involved in the education of their children at school and at home. Parents and 
the community are very 
supportive of the educational programs. Parents 
play an active role by participating as classroom and school volunteers, field trip chaperones, and 
volunteer readers. Parents with students who are English Learners are encouraged to participate in the English Language Learn
er Advisory Committee 
which rev
iews and provides input for the instructional programs at the school site. Parents and staff are also elected to participate 
on the School Site 
Council, which makes decisions regarding the priorities and direction of the educational plan as well as expendi
tures to support student improvement.
 
 
R.O. Hardin is a community school in that most families are within walking distance of the campus.  We recognize that student
s have different abilities, 
learning styles and personalities and require learning that exte
nds beyond the classroom. Our staff offers parents assistance in connecting with doctors, 
dentists, mental health services, counseling, other health programs, social services, legal assistance for domestic violence 
and other community or school 
based servi
ces as needed. A high priority for all staff is to build relationships with students and their families so that we may reach 
and serve every child 
by name and by need.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Cl
imate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Student and staff safety is of primary concern at R.O. Hardin. We strive to provide a safe, clean environment for 
students, staff, volunteers, and registered 
volunteers.
