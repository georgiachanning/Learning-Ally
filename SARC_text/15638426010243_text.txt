About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and
 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Karl F. Clemens Elementary School was established in 1926. Although the school is about 94 years old, its facilities are up
-
to
-
date and provide adequate 
space for students and staff. The facilities include ample cla
ssroom and playground space, adequate office spaces, and a well
-
equipped staff resource 
room. The last re
-
modernization project was in 1986, which means Karl F. Clemens is due and eligible for re
-
modernization funding. This is a major 
planned project that 
will be undertaken in the next  several years.
 
 
Karl F. Clemens has recently added and upgraded seven classroom portables to give site a total of 30 classrooms.  The school 
site also has one computer 
lab, library, physical education/health room, and music/
band room.  The computer lab is quipped with 32 computers. All classrooms have Google Chrome
-
book Carts equipped with enough Chrome
-
books, one for each student. Classrooms have an auditory instrument, doc camera, and interactive Smart 
Board.  In addition, 
the entire site is connected to a district network with wireless internet (WiFi) capability.
 
 
Due to concerted efforts from maintenance and grounds crews, along with our head custodian and custodial staff, all classroom
s, restrooms, and campus 
grounds are 
kept clean and safe on a daily basis.  Apart from safe facilities, school administration and staff work diligently with paren
ts to ensure a safe 
campus for all students and staff. For example, all students must enter campus through one gate. At dismissal, 
students must exit through the same gate. 
All gates are monitored and locked daily by school staff. All visitors, including parents, are required to register and show 
proof of identification through 
the front office before entering campus. Once cleared thr
ough our Raptor monitoring software, visitors are issues a badge that must be worn while on 
campus. All staff members are also required to wear an identification badge at all times.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement 
(Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Karl F. Clemens Elementary is continuously 

that parents are encouraged, such as attending monthly Parent University Nights, Back
-
to
-
School & Parent Orientation Night, District Science Fair, 
Mot

parents are invited to our 
Patriotic Program and our Christmas Holiday Program.  Karl F. Clemens works closely with parents who ser
ve on the School Site Council (SSC) and English 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC).  The Migrant Education Program (MEP) also provides monthly parent workshops and meetings 
through the Parent 
Advisory Committee (PAC).
 
 
It is important to maintain a close w
orking relationship and communication between parents and teachers. For this reason, teachers are encouraged to 
schedule parent
-
teacher conferences throughout the school year to discuss their students' academic progress.  Likewise, parents are encourage
d t
o visit 
their student's teacher to discuss any circumstances that may be affecting the learning process/progress.
 
 
We encourage parent volunteers in our classrooms/school setting.  However, to ensure the safety of all students on campus, th
ere are guidelin
es they 
must follow.  For instance, they first need to meet with the classroom teacher to discuss the type of support they are willin
g and able to provide. Once 
this has been established, they are required to attend a scheduled training/orientation on pare
nt volunteer code of conduct with a site administrator.
 
 
For more information on how to get involved in our classrooms/school setting, parents may contact Mrs. Anna Armendariz, Schoo
l Community Liaison, 
at (661) 758

The SARC provides
 
the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan was last 
reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty in August 2019.  The 2019
-
2020 School Safety Plan will be 
approved by the Board of Trustees on January 14, 2020. The Safe School Plan is for the operation of the school to ensure a sa
fe and orderly e
nvironment, 
and it is implemented continually throughout the school year. Included in the Safe School Plan is the crisis
-
response section, which can be used when or 
if necessary.
 
 
The plan is written and developed by a school safety planning committee and 
School Site Council. The Safety Planning Committee also consults with law 
enforcement in the writing and development of the plan. The committee meets to revise the school safety plan quarterly. The v
ice principal facilitates 
this process and works diligent
ly to implement all components. The school safety plan addresses both a prevention as well as intervention approach. To 
write the plan, the committee collects and analyzes data that includes office referrals, attendance rates, suspension and exp
ulsion data
, local law
-
enforcement juvenile
-
crime data, student, parent, and teacher needs assessments (surveys). The Safe School Plan includes a needs assessment survey
 
to address three specific areas; physical environment , people & programs, and social/emotional. 
The Safe School Plan addresses four areas: prevention, 
preparedness, response, and recovery. The plan is kept at the district office for review andt a copy is also kept at the scho
ol site.

At Karl F. Clemens School, staff professional development (PD) is based on multiple 
measures using local data analysis, district & administrative classroom 

he Rigorous Curriculum 
Design (RCD) model and Common Core S
tate Standards (CCSS) and designed to improve curriculum and instruction.  Teachers are encouraged to 
participate in professional development at different times during the school day and year.  Teachers receive PD at the beginn
ing of the year and on
-
going 
PD throughout the year on Early Release Days Wednesdays.  Karl F. Clemens provides professional development for all teachers 
on the use of all adopted 
textbooks. In addition, ELPD has been offered based on ELL data and needs assessments (i.e., EL strategie

Share, & Socratic Seminar.  Other ELPD provided to our staff includes the management and implementation of software programs 
for our ELLs in 
grades 4th

data analysis. Our 
school is in its third year using the 95% Group Literacy Program.  It is fully implemented school
-
wide. Teach

consultant of 95 Group three times a year.
 
 
The academic coach and learning director provide instructional assistance throughout the school year.  In addition, the acade
mic coach puts out a teacher 
needs assessment 
survey to get an idea of the PD needed at each grade level. If unable to provide specific PD from within the district, then w
e work in 
conjunction with KCSOS to provide professional development that addresses the needs of all students (i.e., EL, SDC, Migra
nt, etc.).  Additionally, our 
English Language student coach gives focus EL instructional strategies and resources throughout the year in the form of after
-
hours PD as well as in class 
modeling for teachers.
