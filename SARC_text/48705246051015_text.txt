School Description
 
Robert Semple Elementary, named after one of the city's founders, is a pre
-
kindergarten through 
fifth grade school with approximately 470 students. Built over 50 years ago, Semple has been an 
integral part of Benicia for half a century. Many of our parents
 
attended Semple when they were 
children. Robert Semple is a neighborhood school and on any given weekend, you'll find community 
youth teams playing sports on the school field, families recreating on the playground, and 
community members utilizing our faci
lity. Many children walk or bike to school. There is easy access 
to several parks, the public library, and downtown for walking field trips to explore our rich history.  
Robert Semple's community is proud of its close ties to the local artist community thr
ough 
collaboration in performing arts, sculpture, pottery, painting, music, our STEAM Wheel, and our 
annual Art Day.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
