Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
current school facilities were built in 1963. Bella Vista Elementary School also has two preschools on its campus. In 
2005, construction of the new gymnasium with two classrooms for Music and PE was completed. The project included a 
stage, large drop down 
screen, and sound system, which allows the gymnasium to serve as our Performing Arts Center.
 
In 2007, six classrooms and the administrative building underwent a complete modernization project. This project included 
the kitchen, cafeteria and the library.
 
I
n 2013, additional fencing was added. In areas that had 4' fencing it was replaced with 6' fencing. Three out
-
dated 
portable classrooms were removed, and a large portion of the school's septic system was replaced.
 
In 2014, renovations were completed in the
 
kitchen, cafeteria and administrative building. The remodeling project 
improved the functionality of the kitchen as well as the cafeteria.
 
In 2015, physical fitness equipment for the playground was purchased along with with swings to encourage student 
act
ivity and fitness.
 
In 2016, one half of the school was painted and PBIS signage was added to the playground, common areas, and classrooms.
 
In 2017, the other half of the school was painted, updated fencing replaced chain link fencing in the front of the 
school, 
and window tinting film was applied to classroom windows.
 
In 2018, drainage was added to alleviate the flooding of classrooms, and the garage was refurbished with new siding, 
paint, and signage.
 
In 2019, the playground and parking lot were resurfac
ed and restriped, the gym floor was stripped and rewaxed in July 
and December, new siding and trim was added to the preschool buildings, and the air conditioners on the gym roof had 
protective structures built over them to keep pigeons out of the units.
