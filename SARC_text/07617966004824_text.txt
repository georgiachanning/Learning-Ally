By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Lake Elementary School is a TK
-
6 school located in the city of San Pablo. The school is located in a building constru
cted in 
1957. Due to the condition of the property, many repairs are needed to modernize the structure and meet the needs of 
our community. Despite the current conditions, Lake has continued to strive to provide quality education for all its 
students. Lake
 
is a Title 1
-
 
School. As a Title 1 school, lunch is provided at a 100% free and reduced rate. The 393 student 
population is comprised of 75% Latino, 11% African American, 12% Asian, 2% White, and 1% various other ethnic descent. 
Forty
-
Six percent of the s
tudents are classified as English Language Learners. Lake is part of the City of San Pablo's 

community school is both a set of partnerships
 
and a place where services, supports, and opportunities lead to improved 

 
 

 

ademic and social expectations 
for ourselves and our communities.
 
 

 
Our primary goal is to develop lifelong learners that are committed to lives characterized by love, integrity, respect, self
-
discipline, and hope in pursuit of just
ice and equity for all. We believe it takes an entire community to develop a well
-
nurtured child. Educators, parents, students, and community partners work collectively every day to provide hands
-
on, 
exciting inquiry
-
based learning and social
-
emotional sup
port opportunities to inspire young minds to reach new heights. 

Response to Intervention Model includes academic as well as social/em
otional supports. The implementation of workshop 
based bully support along with robust counseling opportunities contributes to a culture of students and families feeling 
safe and supported.
 
 
Our after
-
school program is run by an organization called Love, L
earn, Success. The program provides students in grades 
1
-
6 with homework support, academically
-
aligned lessons, character building skills and enrichment activities such as hip
-
hop dance, kickboxing, art, gardening, and mentor groups.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effor
t, the school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process
 
is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and 
recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response acti
vities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon goal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.
 
 
The objectives of the School Site Safety Plan are as follows:
 
1.
 
Protect the safety and welfare of students, school staff, and visitors.
 
2.
 
Provide for a safe and coordinated response to emergencies.
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
Enable the District to restore normal conditions with minimal confusion in
 
the shortest time possible.
 
5.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between sites and the District Emergency Operations Center (DEOC).
 
6.
 
Provide for the interface and coordination between the District EOC and the Cities of Richmond, El Cerrito, San 
Pablo
, Pinole, Hercules, and Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
 
7.
 
Provide for the orderly conversion of pre
-
designated District sites to mass care sites, when necessary.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is updated annually.  Our school sa
fety plan was last annually reviewed, updated, 
and discussed with school faculty and a student representative in January 2020.  A copy of the Comprehensive School

Lake teachers participate in professional development in a variety of ways. The core of our program is guided by the 
Instructional Leadership Team which meets once a month to plan and/or review upcoming professional development. 
Leadership is provided by t
he principal and various teachers who have gone to district training. Teachers use the cycle of 
inquiry to monitor student learning and guide instruction. Teachers also receive on
-
site training on strategies for English 
language arts, math or ELD to suppor
t student learning. Teachers meet in grade
-
level teams, look at student work, and 
plan the implementation of the instructional program. Teachers also participate in district
-
wide literacy and math training 
and English Language Development training.
 
 
Qualit
y instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Academic Support Division engages teachers, administrators and other personnel in ongoing professional development 
focused on improving t
eaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrators to improve their 
ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The principals, in turn, 
provide support to teachers thro
ugh staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and planning, and individual 
coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with both on and off
-
site 
professional development in all standards
-
based curr
iculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, professional 
development is provided in English Language Development, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), differentiated 
instruction and educational technology. In addition, training is made available in cl
assroom management and the effective 
use of assessment data and teacher data teams in meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional 
development program is ensuring that all students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers a
nd that teachers are 
supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
