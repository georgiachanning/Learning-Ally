About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in C
alifornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local education
al agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, da
ta reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca
.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Classroom space at Discovery Charter School is adequate to support our school's enrollment of 900 students.  Discovery School
's custodial staff works 
closely with Chula Vista Elementary
 
School District's Facilities and Maintenance personnel to maintain a systematic cleaning schedule that ensures routine 
maintenance functions are performed on a regular and scheduled basis.  Three full
-
time custodians perform basic cleaning operations dail
y.  Through 
the use of the Facility Inspection Tool, an annual review of available educational space is conducted by the District and sit
e to ensure that all students 
and teachers have adequate teaching and learning space.
 
 
The entire school campus is secu
red with perimeter fencing and gates are open at limited times to control access to the campus.  The RAPTOR Visitor 
Management System tracks all visitors and volunteers on campus while gates are closed.  The system promotes a safe environmen
t by identifyin
g all 
adults on campus at any given time.  During operating hours, all visitors must report to the main office, receive permission 
to gain access to the campus 
and sign in prior to being issued a visitor or volunteer badge.   A DVR Surveillance Security Sy
stem was installed on the campus at strategic points with 
12 cameras. In 2016, an additional 5 DVR Surveillance Security camera's were installed to bring the total to 17 cameras.  Mon
thly fire drills and other 
scheduled emergency drills are conducted in co
njunction with the District and law enforcement experts, including Chula Vista Police Department.
 
 
All air conditioning units were replaced with energy efficient units.  The school received energy efficient lighting in porta
ble classrooms, as well as new 
c
arpeting and tile work in the 2007 school year.  The school purchased 2 additional portable classrooms for the 2017
-
2018 school year. The school 

ry's custodians take pride in maintaining a 
clean and safe campus.  Working collaboratively with district facilities and maintenance, the custodial staff immediately rec
tifies any concerns or safety 
issues.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools.  
Parents are highly encouraged to become actively involved in the 
education of their children through participation on school governance committees, classroom volunteer opportunities, and ser
vice opportunities.
 
 
Parents orchestrate and implement special eve
nts, such as the Spring Fling, Family Dances, Fall Carnival, and the School Campout through the Parent 
Teacher Children Committee (PTC).  Parent meetings are designed and delivered around topics generated from annual parent surv
eys.  Such topics 
include, b
ut are not limited to: grade level standards, assessments, curriculum and instruction, technology, support/networking, and pa
renting skills.  In 
addition, parents have access to special events through both the school and the Chula Vista Elementary School D
istrict, such as the school's GATE Parent 
Night on technology use and the District's Parent Academy.  Furthermore, parents and members of the community volunteer many 
hours in classrooms, 
in the school office, and at our traffic loops, as well as at the sc
hool's special events.  Parents help with events such as the Annual APEX Fun Run, Student 
Safety Day, Red Ribbon Week, Military Appreciation Day, Dual Immersion Cultural Night, STEAM Night, Speech Contest, theater p
roductions, and Walking 
Club.  Room paren
ts work with teachers and staff to implement meaningful learning activities both in and out of the classroom.  Parents serve 
as 
chaperones at field trips.  Parents volunteer as safety monitors at the parent pick up loops, working closely with the school
's 
Safety Patrol and School 
Resource Officer (SRO).  Discovery is a model of true two
-
way communication as parents and teachers communicate on a regular basis through such 
communication tools as: Class Dojo, Jupiter Grades, Edmodo, and Bloomz.
 
 
Discovery Char
ter School parents serve on various academic and school support committees and are an integral part of school governance. Par
ents serve 
as members of the Charter's Board of Directors, School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), t
he School Safety Committee, 
and Parent /Teacher/Children (PTC) Committee.  Parents are also invited to meet with the school's administration through the 
quarterly "Coffee with 
the Principal" meetings.  Parents provide input in annual budget planning and in
 
promoting school activities.  Parents are invited to help with the Friends 
of Discovery, an organization committed to providing additional opportunities for students.  Dual Language Immersion Program 
parents have helped 
shape the program and provided valu
able input through forums and our Bi
-
literacy Committee.  Parents' voices are heard through surveys and responses 

y, by participati
ng in home 
projects, and by reviewing math concepts and facts with them. Parents also played a major role in monitoring homework by chec

planners and by ensuring that their children have a specified time and appropriate place to comple
te their assignments. Parent voice through surveys 
and school committees are an integral part of the school's LCAP plan.
 
 
Parent involvement and volunteerism is encouraged for parents of students of Discovery Charter School. Each family is 
encouraged to volunteer a 
minimum of 6 hours per year.  There are many opportunities to volunteer at Discovery. Volunteers are expected to attend a bri
ef in
-
service at the 
beginning of each school year and all volunteers must sign a Volunteer Agreement for
m. All volunteers who work directly with students do so under the 
supervision of certificated staff and must have a current TB skin test result on file in the school office. Arrangements for 
volunteering in a classroom are 
to be made with the teacher and/o
r school administration in advance. Contact us at (619) 656
-
0797 to get involved!  Translation services and services 
for the hearing or visually impaired are available upon request and provided regularly by the school.  In addition, the schoo
l makes every 
effort to provide 
childcare at all major parent meetings in the evenings.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Discovery Charter School seeks to enhance school safety through a variety of strategies that focus on the people and the prog
rams of our school.
 
 
Student safety and well
-
being are ensured throug
h monthly fire drills, quarterly duck & cover earthquake preparedness drills, annual bus evacuation 
drill, and bi
-
annual secure campus and lockdown drills.  Through a special grant from the Anti
-

the s
chool is able to fund activities that educate students on topics such as anti
-
bias, anti
-
discrimination, drug and alcohol abuse and prevention, 
character development, social skills, bully prevention, and cyber
-
bullying.  The School Safety Patrol assists st
udents and families by providing pedestrian 
crossing before and after school in nearby designated crosswalks.  Two adult supervisors also monitor crossings at key inters
ections adjacent to the 
school. Parent volunteers, classified staff, and administrators
 
also help support student safety in traffic loops.  School personnel monitor students during 
recess and during lunch and lunch recess.  Led by teachers and the school's Dean of Students, the school's MTSS Committee has
 
worked on developing 
restorative pra
ctices, such as community circles and using components of the Sanford
-
Harmony social
-
emotional curriculum, to support students.  
Additionally, Discovery has brought back the KIDCO program and hired a student support provider.  The goals of the KIDCO prog
ra
m are to insure that 
all children at Discovery Charter get off to a good start in school by fostering healthy self
-
concepts, developing social skills to get along with others, and 
make friends.

Discovery's Safe School Committee monitors and 
measures progress towards annual safety goals that evolve from staff, student, parent, and greater 
community input. There are two major components within our plan, Creating a Positive School Climate and the Physical Environm
ent.  These components 
address a
ll areas that impact the safety of students, staff, and visitors.  The school's safety plan ensures Character and Citizenship
 
Development, 
Restorative Practices, Student Surveys, Youth Mental Health, First Aid, Attendance, Safe Egress/Ingress, and Security
 
Protocols and Procedures.  The plan 
also includes emergency procedures.  Discovery's School Safety Plan was reviewed, discussed with staff, shared at a community
 
forum with the school's 
Board of Directors and updated in October 2019. It was approved by th
e school's School Site Council in October 2019.
