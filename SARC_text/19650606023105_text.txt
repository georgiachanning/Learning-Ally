California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress(CAASPP) System includes the Smarter Balanced SummativeAssessments (SBAC) for students in the general education population,and the California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for students with themost significant cognitive disabilities.  Only eligible students mayparticipate in the administration of the CAAs.  CAAs items are alignedwith alternative achievement standards, which are linked with theCommon Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are ameasure of how well students are mastering California's standards inEnglish language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given togrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess studentperformance in ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizingcomputer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test itemsare aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked withthe Common Core State Standards (CCSS).The CAASPP results shown in this report include overall resultscomparing the school, district and state scores as well as the school'soverall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown only forsubgroups with ten students or more taking the exam.

 Campus Supervision
School administration and teaching staff place a high priority on providing
adequate adult supervision on campus before, during, and after school.
As students arrive on campus each morning, teachers are strategically
assigned to designated entrance areas and the playground. During
recess, teachers monitor playground activity. Noon aides monitor lunch
time activity in the cafeteria and on the playground. At the end of the day
when students are dismissed, teachers monitor student behavior to
ensure a safe and orderly departure. 
Hickory Elementary School is a closed campus. During school hours, all
visitors must be buzzed in at the front school entry gate where office staff
members can monitor who is at the gate. They must also sign in at the
school's office with a valid state issued identification card to be scanned
through the Raptor security system and wear the printed identification
sticker while on school grounds. 
 School Site Safety Plan
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan was developed for Hickory
Elementary School in collaboration with local agencies and the district
office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan
include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of
dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedures
for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and

dress code policy. The school's most recent school safety plan was
reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff in November 2019.
Classroom Environment
 Discipline & Climate for Learning
Hickory Elementary School's discipline policies are based upon Positive
Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS), a multi-tiered approach to
social, emotional and behavior support. This schoolwide positive
behavior management plan is used as a guide to develop school rules,
develop behavior management programs, promote responsibility,
promote respect, and minimize classroom disruptions. Progressive
discipline and proactive measures are employed in the classroom for
those students experiencing difficulty following school rules and
demonstrating positive behavior. Disciplinary intervention is managed by
school administrators in a fair, firm, and consistent manner based upon
the nature of each situation.
