About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

committee of teachers, known as 
the Curriculum Council, with representatives from each school. The Curriculum Council narrows the field of state

finalists in an actual instructional setting. They then submit a recommendation to the Curriculum Council. Administration the

day 
public review period. Provided there are no exceptions, the recommendation is brought back for action at the following meetin
g.
 
 
This year, the school district adopted a new social studies textbook.  Four John Muir
 
teachers participated in the pilot of 2 programs.  District teachers 
recommended the Pearson, My World series to the Board.  The new adoption was implemented during the 2019
-
2020 school year.  Science textbooks 
will be piloted during the Spring of 2020 an
d will make a final recommendation at the end of the 2020 school year.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. On
ly eligible students

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities)
; and

The safety plan covers safety procedures, including visitor policy, emergency materials, and evacuation procedures. The safet
y plan is reviewed with all 
staff at the beginning of each year. It was most recently reviewed, updated and discussed with s
taff in January 2020.  Our Big Five Committee leads 30 
minute sessions on safety procedures monthly during staff meetings.   Drills are held on a monthly basis and include fire, ea
rthquake, lockdown, and 
evacuation. The safety plan is located in the office
 
for public access. All visitors must sign in and out of the office and wear a visitor sticker. Visitors are 
accounted for in all drills. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lu
nch, and after school.
 
Supervision 
is shared among noon supervisors, teachers, and the administration.
