By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General Information
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. Below is more specific informati
on 
on the condition of the school and the efforts made
 
to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional 
learning environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking 
with the school principal.
 
 
Age of School Buildings:
 
Our facili
ties were built in 1953. The school facilities include a library, multipurpose room, cafeteria, gymnasium, music 
room, technology center, and 18 classrooms. In our field area of the school, we have a large blacktop area with several 
basketball courts, a st
andard size football field, and an open grass area. The classrooms were modernized in 1999
-
2002. 
Walls, floors, ceilings, and cabinets were installed. New roofs and canopies were done as a part of modernization and a 
deferred maintenance hardship.  The res
trooms were updated during the summer of 2017 and the outside of the school 
was repainted.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a 
timely manner. Our most recent Williams Inspection validates our overall score of good in all perimeters 
of the school. This table displays the results of the most recently completed school site inspection to determine the school 
facility's good repair sta
tus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of West Fresno Middle School. Before, during, and after school, 
responsibility for monitoring the campus is shared by instructional support staff and certificated staff. All 
visitors must 
sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus. We have a closed campus and students are not 
allowed off campus during the school day. The comprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for 
emer
gencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The plan requires 
identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, evaluation of physical facilities, 
and communication with st
aff and students.
 
 
Components of the plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, procedures for teacher notification of dangerous 
pupils, disaster response procedures, procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and 
suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and fully compliant with 
federal and state regulations. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, individual staff responsibilities during an 
incident, exit rou
tes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make the plan available on our school website and keep 
copies in the office for parents. We ensure all staff is properly trained throughout the year, practice fire drills monthly, 
and individual crisis drills 
three times a year. An updated copy is available to the public at the school office.

Professional development at West Fresno Middle School is designed to meet the individual needs of teachers as well as 
broader school concerns. It is designed to assist staff members in refining 
existing skills and learning new skills to achieve 
district and state accountability goals. The professional development program is ongoing and clearly reflects the vision 
and mission of our school. Our Administration team, grade level leads, and teachers 
are committed to the ongoing 
practices of a Professional Learning Community (PLC)  Model. Our Teachers analyze assessment data and student work to 
ensure accurate reflections of student academic growth. This information is in turn utilized to infuse learni
ng strategies, 
lesson design, and best teaching and student engagement practices to increase levels of student proficiency.
 
 
West Fresno has 2 hours of PLC time per week embedded in the master schedule for teachers.  Also required are three 
days of distric
t and site professional development prior to the start of the school year and four days of optional 
professional development offered each summer.  Teachers are paid for their participation.  Topics for these sessions are 
selected based on greatest areas of
 
needs outlined in the LCAP using data from the dashboard and other local indicators.
 
 
Academic Coaching is also offered to our teachers.  Two coaches share their time between the four district sites.  Areas of 
coaching focus are:  classroom management for
 
new teachers, math lesson engagement, and lessin design and delivery 
for all subjects.
 
 
Current Professional Development opportunities include Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures, Lesson Design and 
Delivery with emphasis on student engagement strategies
 
(T4 Learning), Eureka Math, Guided Rading provided by Fresno 
County Superintendent of Schools, and English Language Development also provided by FCSS. Our teachers also provide 
each other with numerous teaching strategies and focused professional developm
ent in areas such writing skills, creating 
Constructed Responses for SBAC, and graphic organizers.  In addition, our Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and 
Assessment has facilitated district
-
wide trainings in Mathematical Mindsets, Units of Study, Illum
inate, Instructional 
Technology, and Professional Learning Community Facilitation.
