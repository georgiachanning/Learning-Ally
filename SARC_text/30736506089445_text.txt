By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

Report Card ref
lects current information. It provides an overview of our school profile and communicates specific data 
regarding demographics and student achievement results.
 
 
Located in the village of Greentree, our school is a neighborhood school with an enrollment of 
approximately 470 students 
in grades Kindergarten through Grade six including a self
-
contained Tk
-
K Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI)  classroom.  
Our attendance area includes the communities of California Homes, Greentree, Heritage Park, Heritage Poi
nt, Irvine 
Groves, Walnut Square, El Camino Glen and the Willows. We have an open enrollment policy that allows children from 
other communities in Irvine the opportunity to attend Greentree Elementary School. Greentree Elementary School has a 
diverse commu
nity with children coming to us from many cultural backgrounds. This diversity allows for many additional 
learning experiences for our students.
 
 
There are many people who share the responsibility for the successful education of children at Greentree Eleme
ntary 
School. We have a strong instructional staff that is committed to providing children with the highest educational 
experience possible. Our school support staff, our school office, and our custodial staff are an integral part of our school.
  
Our missi
on at Greentree Elementary School, is to foster a growth mindset, in order to empower all students to be risk 
takers, creative critical thinkers, communicators who collaborate, and who are committed to success. Through our 
professional learning communities
 
we celebrate both academic and social responsibility in all of our students.   It is our 
Vision to be: "One Team ~ One Goal ~ Committed to success for All".
 
 
It is our philosophy to provide an academic environment that is safe and child
-
centered.  Our tea
chers are involved in staff 
development opportunities that provide further excellence in teaching.  They work together in Professional Learning 
Communities to plan and analyze student work and progress.  All students are challenged to reach their individua
l 
potential.   Students who have not reached proficiency in reading or math are offered additional instruction, during the 
instructional day, through our GO Time Intervention block of time. Teachers and Instructional support staff use research 
based instru
ctional strategies to develop each student to his/her greatest potential including Response to Instruction (RTI) 
in the area of Reading.
 
 
Our program offerings have included GATE clusters in our 4th 
-
 
6th grade classrooms, support services (Speech, 
Occupat
ional Therapist, Physical Therapist, Guidance Assistant, Elementary Resource Counselor (ERC), and school 
psychologist), English Language Development Instructional Assistant, Title I Reading/Math specialist, and a school site 
Teacher On Special Assignment (
TOSA)  to work with our staff and our students. Our curriculum specialists provide 
enrichment in the areas of art, music and science and our support staff provides assistance and reinforcement of essential 
skills learned in the classroom.
 
 
Greentree Elemen
tary School practices Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS).  Staff, through collaborative 
staff development opportunities, created the behavioral expectations for student behaviors on our campus.  These 
behavioral expectations are explicitly
 
taught and reinforced through our schoolwide SOAR matrix as well as by classroom 
SOAR matrices for expectations within the classroom setting.  It is our hope that these practices will help students build 
internal practices so they can experience healthy s
elf
-
esteem and develop a vision and a passion about ways to contribute 
to their community.  We conduct monthly awards to honor student academic and behavioral achievements.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Greentree is a facility made up of 5 pods developed around a central office, a little theater, and a media center. Each 
pod/neighborhood consists of four classrooms and boys and girls restrooms.  These areas were renovated
 
in the summer 
of 2017 and now consist of open collaborative spaces with innovative furniture for various student instructional purposes.   
Five portable classrooms, located to the North of the main building house our Innovation Lab, a science lab, Speech,
 
school 
psychologist's office, as well as a Principal's conference room.   We have a large field area directly behind our school whic
h 
is used for K
-
6 Physical Education and recreation activities during recess and lunch periods.  This field is also used by
 
community groups on evenings and weekends with prior district approval.  A three foot high barrier wall and a six foot 
high fence separate our field from the Metro Link tracks to ensure student safety.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance
 
and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grad
es three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with t
he most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical educatio
n sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and staff work 
in partnership to ensure that every child is successful.  There are many wonderful opportunities 
for parental involvement at our school.  Our teachers meet with parents in the Fall to set goals for each child's academic 
program.  The School Site Council (S
SC) is an advisory group that meets regularly to receive information, discuss school 
programs and provide input towards school based decision making.  This group is comprised of an equal representation 
of members of the community (5) and site level staff (
5).  SSC members serve a two year term on this council.  Our 
wonderful PTA supports our school program by encouraging and organizing parent involvement and enriching the school 
programs by providing enrichment opportunities, special assemblies, services, a
ctivities, and providing funding for 
classroom supplies, upgrading software, hardware, and other technological needs. Our Dad's group has provided multiple 
activities, such as Donuts with Dads and our spring field activities, for students and their dads or
 
other important adult, to 
become involved in our school.  Parents can become involved with PTA by attending regularly scheduled PTA association 
meetings as posted on our school website and/or contact http://greentree.my
-
pta.org to get in contact with any 
of our 
PTA Board Members.  Teachers enjoy having parents support their classrooms by working with small groups of children, 
assisting on field trips, and/or helping to coordinate classroom activities.  Please contact your child's classroom teacher t
o 
inqui
re about ways they may be able to utilize your skills within the classroom setting.

Monthly fire evacuation drills are conducted and our school participates in earthquake preparedness twice each year as 
part of our commitment to a safe and orderly campus. 
The disaster preparedness committee meets on a regular basis to 
continually update and improve our plan. A school crisis team has also been formed for an unforeseen crisis situation. 
Students and staff alike participate in annual "lock down" drills twice e
ach year for practice in emergency situations. In 
addition, Greentree Elementary School has the School Messenger Web Portal messaging system that allows us the 
opportunity to contact all parents at once in the event of an emergency via their phones, e
-
mail
, text, or a combination of 
all. The school is equipped with the necessary items and emergency supplies to shelter students immediately following a 
disaster and until students can be moved to a safe harbor. Greentree School also has social media accounts t
o alert parents 
to any and all issues at Greentree School, especially in the area of safety. Parents can follow us at: FaceBook: Greentree 
School IUSD Instagram: greentree_iusd and Twitter: @greentree_iusd
 
 
Greentree is equipped with seven (7) exterior and
 
one (1) interior camera to capture images of anything significant that 
could harm our facility and/or our students, staff and community that are housed within the facility. We also have the 
ability to "lockdown" our school at the push of a button that wil
l immediately notify local authorities should any kind of 
need arise. 
 
 
We place a high value and have a strong commitment to safety at Greentree Elementary School.

taking. Teacher
s are involved in three full day 
professional learning opportunities and six after school workshops, ranging from 1 1/2

3 hours in length, that continually 
refine and extend their teaching strategies. Each grade level team works in Professional Learning 
Communities to plan, 
share ideas/materials, analyze student learning data, and to problem solve strategies to provide a cohesive program within 
each classroom.  Current research in education continues to be an ongoing priority for us. Our areas of focus fo
r 
professional development recently have centered around the following concepts:  Assessment/Grading Practices, Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS),   Professional Learning Communities (all 2nd
