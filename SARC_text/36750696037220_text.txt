School Description
 
Citrus Elementary School is one of 14 schools in the Upland Unified School District, located at the 
base of the San Gabriel Mountains in the city of Upland.  Citrus Elementary is situated amongst a 
mixture of residential single dwelling homes, apartments, 
condominiums and commercial 
buildings.  Our student population reflects the demographics of our community and we value the 
rich experiences and opportunities that our diversity offers as we learn, play and work together.
 
 
Vision Statement: Working as an 
educational community, we utilize best practices to facilitate 
lifelong learning and social responsibility for all students.  We are committed to foster individual 
success by providing an environment that builds self esteem, promotes lifelong skills, and n
urture 
intellectual curiosity.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The Citrus Elementary School staff pride themselves on providing an atmosphere that promotes 
cooperation and collaboration among community members, students and staff.   Our expectation 
is that students wil
l be provided a rigorous and challenging curriculum utilizing best practices and 
differentiated instruction so all students thrive. We appreciate and embrace all differences, 
celebrate and nurture diversity and weave character and values through our work. 
 
We will provide 
a safe and nurturing environment in which students, staff and community feel a sense of security; 
physically, mentally and emotionally, and build the tools and skills necessary for our students to be 
competitive in educational endeavors an
d productive members of society.
 
 
Goal
 
Student achievement results will not show significant differences between student sub
-
groups.
 
 
Citrus classrooms are models of 21st Century learning that include an electronic teaching wall with 
interactive boards, pr
ojection/audio systems, skylights, room upgrades and 1:1 Chromebooks for 
student use in Grades TK
-
6.. We are excited to see our school continue to grow technologically with 
the addition of our Innovation Lab.  The Innovation Lab is available to all grades 
and consists of 
iPads, Robotics, Lego Robotics, Spheros, 3
-
D printer, green screen, digital microscopes, digital 
cameras, 360 degree camera and a touch screen television. Citrus also provides after school clubs 
for enrichment. Some of the clubs that have b
een offered include: Homework Club, yearbook, 
garden, Engineering for Kids, Coding, Success Through Chess, and English Language Arts and math 
intervention. We are excited to offer these programs, directed by teachers, support staff, and local 
consultants f
or minimal or no cost to parents. Think Together is an after school program established 
through state funds to keep kids safe after school. This program has a maximum of 100 students 
supervised by trained adults. Think Together meets Monday through Friday

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For
 
additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Citrus Elementary believes there is great value in working in partnership with the families and community we serve.  To build
 
community, Citrus has 
quarterly "Coffee with Ms. Golbaf" where parents and care
-
givers can learn abo
ut the school and express concerns about the school and its practices.  
The principal also gives suggestions for building strong partnerships with teachers and the school community.  Monthly PTA me
etings, and quarterly 
School Site Council and ELAC meetings
 
encourage parents to actively contribute to the school community.
 
 
A school website provides parents with resources, a yearly calendar, and frequently asked questions about our school. Opportu

available at Back

our doors are open for parents to volunteer in our workroom or in a classroom in any way they feel comfortable.
 
 
We are extremely proud of 
our Watch D.O.G.S. (Dads Of Great Students) program.  The purpose of the program is to provide positive male role models 
for the students and demonstrating, by their presence, that education is important.  They also provide extra sets of eyes and
 
ears to e

school year. Fathers and father

Additionally, we host Family Education nights throughout the school year on our three goals: Social Emotional Learning, Numer
acy, and Literac
y.  These 
allow specialists to share strategies for parents to use at home for behavior and academic growth.  We balance these with PTA
 
community events such 
as our Fall and Spring Festivals and movie nights.  It is our goal for parents to feel they are va
lued members of the learning community.  In an effort to 
support our families, we partner with the district's Healthy Start program for additional resources.

The Upland Unified School District believes that high quality, research
-
based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of 
teaching skills and concepts. The District provides or 
coordinates on
-
going training based on needs identified through student performance indicators, 
including results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessme
nts for California, District 
iReady
 
benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding specific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District S
trategic Plan for 
Student Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, an
d conferences that allow them to 
grow professionally and provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathema
tics, reading intervention 
and technology as well as follow
-
up coaching support full implementatio
n of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration 
on student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom
-
based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching 
implemented as the result of analys
is of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and 
Mapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning
, 21st Century 
Cla
ssroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Desi
gn for Learning, 
and Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all
-
day workshops, after
-
school wo
rkshops and meetings, individual 
coaching/mentoring, and off
-
site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review 
Program is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of conten
t knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the District calendar includes a 
collaboration day schedule each week to allow for on
-
going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.
