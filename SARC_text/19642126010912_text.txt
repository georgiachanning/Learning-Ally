A Message from the Principal
 
As the 
Principal of Melbourne Elementary I am committed to continuing to work with all 
stakeholders for the academic success and social
-
emotional well
-
being of all students.  Melbourne 
Elementary School is a Professional Learning Community school which means our 
teachers 
collaborate regularly to ensure the academic success of all our students. As a staff we are dedicated 
to utilizing the most effective teaching strategies with our students on a daily basis through our 
implementation of AVID. AVID, or Advancement V
ia Individual Determination, provides focused 
instructional strategies and support around Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization and 
Reading to learn. As a teaching staff we will continue to provide the very best educational program 
for students tha
t provides rigor and support.  Our staff is dedicated to providing students with 
instruction aligned to the California State Standards, which our district has supported by providing 
professional development opportunities for teachers that support every stu
dent on our campus.  
Our teaching staff is also involved in received training in the areas of English Language 
Development, writing and the review of instructional data. During this time they participate in 
academic interventions, homework help, sports pro
grams, and many other activities. We will also 
offer before and after school intervention programs for at risk and English Learner students in order 
to close the achievement gap.
 
 
As an AVID Elementary School we believe our students deserve to be college a
nd career minded as 
early as elementary school.  Our teachers, students, parents and community have shown their 
support of becoming an AVID school through our PTA, ELAC and School Site Council meetings. We 
are committed to providing students differentiated
 
instruction that is focused on closing the 
achievement for our at risk and English Learner students.  Our teachers are committed to providing 
regular opportunities for writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization and reading to learn.  Through 
Melbourne'
s implementation of AVID we have felt and seen the difference in the Instruction, 
Culture, Leadership and Systems of the school all towards the goal of closing the achievement gap 
of all students.
 
 
Melbourne Elementary School is located in the city of Lake
wood and serves 530 students in grades 
from Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through sixth grade on a traditional calendar system. 
Melbourne Elementary School is committed to providing students with high quality education and 
opportunities to use technology 
that will prepare them for 21st Century skills.
 
 
Ella P. Melbourne Elementary is a school community where the highest expectations are 
maintained. Melbourne utilizes all available resources to enable students to become life
-
long 
learners who possess the ab
ility to achieve their utmost potential. We promote a safe, nurturing, 
and stimulating environment that invites students to actively participate in educational 
opportunities. Melbourne provides a welcoming atmosphere in which parents and community 
members 
are encouraged to become immersed in student's educational endeavors. Individual 
academic and social needs of staff and students are met, creating a desirable environment where 
all participants are successful.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in C
alifornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local education
al agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, da
ta reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca
.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate 
Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement st
andards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to th

Our teachers actively seek opportunities for professional growth to provide effective instruction with the focus on student l
earning.  Staff development 
is based on the assessed needs of the school 
personnel. Staff members work collaboratively to determine the school's needs and take direction from 
District and State requirements when establishing professional development goals for the school year.  Schoolwide training fo
cus areas include 
technology,
 
differentiation, and using data to drive instruction. Staff members build teaching skills and concepts by participating in ma
ny conferences 
and workshops throughout the year and by sharing their experiences and knowledge with colleagues. The District offe
rs professional development funds 
to school sites for professional development activities. Professional Learning Communities and Secondary Literacy are example
s of district wide 
professional development.  Our district is also providing every teacher with p
rofessional development related to Common Core Standards.
