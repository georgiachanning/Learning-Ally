Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Poster Club, Safety Patrol, and the Yearbook Committee, offer opportunities to provide service to the school community.
 
 
Differ

in our di
verse society. MHT has an active PTA that supports programs such as Young Audiences, Art in Action, and hosts 
numerous community building events.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Tobias maintains a clean and safe facility. The custodians clean daily and the district maintenance department removes 
graffiti, repairs vandalism, and broken windows immediately.
 
 
Several years ago, voters approved a 52 million dollar bond to renovate district schools. Our school now has upgraded 
bathrooms, wiring, flooring, and handicapped accessibility.
 
 
Data reported are the determination of good repair as documented in a completed Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
conducted every year. The most recent inspection was conducted in August, 2019. Additional information about the 
condition of the school's faci
lities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The larger safety plan is in the process of being updated to include smokey day procedures and
 
active shooter/intruder 
procedures.  As a site we already have protocols in place and will continue to practice.  For smokey days we have 
procedures similar to rainy day recesses.  Also, students sensitive to smoke have access to the library and MUR on 
mo
derate days.
 
 
Staff practice intruder drills in their classrooms and on the yard during PE.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff 
Development and Continuous Improvement

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent 
three
-
year period.
 
 
Professional development is provided to the staff so that 
everyone is abreast of current instructional techniques that 
benefit teaching and learning in the classroom. District and County workshops, Common Planning Time on a weekly basis, 
and monthly staff meetings all focus on optimal instructional practices. Our
 
current professional development, focuses on 
instruction that address the Common Core State Standards in both Language Arts and Math.
 
 
Common Planning Time occurs every Wednesday. Students are released at 1:43 pm affording instructors an opportunity 
to pl
an instruction across all CORE curricular areas, analyze assessments, and strengthen teaching practices, for one hour 
each week. The program was implemented in 2008
-
2009.
