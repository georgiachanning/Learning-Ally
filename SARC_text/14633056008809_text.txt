By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The maintenance staff at Round Valley school is committed to keeping our facilities clean and in good repair. In addition, 
every effort is 
made to keep our campus safe and beautiful for the students, staff, and community. The buildings at Round 
Valley School were originally built in the early 1950s. All buildings are in good repair and are inspected annually. With the
 
passage of a school faci
lities bond in November 1999, Round Valley School has made many improvements to the facilities. 
A school modernization project of the primary wing and school cafeteria was completed in 2000. In 2003, Round Valley 
School received a Federal Renovation Grant,
 
and asbestos removal was completed along with remodeling the primary 
wing bathrooms. In 2004, using bond facilities money, a complete remodel of the front of the main school building, 
including expansion of the administrative offices, was completed. The s
chool has replaced an old relocatable classroom 
with a new relocatable to be used as a library/learning center. A classroom has been remodeled as a modernization project 
to be a new art/science room. The projects were funded using a local bond measure and 
State modernization funds. These 
improvements were completed in the 2008
-
2009 school year. We are proud of the additions made to the school in recent 
years. Along with the construction projects that have been completed, many landscaping features have been 
added to 
the school campus. These landscaping projects, which include additional grass and trees, have given the school a beautiful 
new look.  In 2015 Round Valley School received a state grant to put in a new well that will service the District for decade
s 
to come.
 
 
Round Valley School continues to upgrade its wireless Internet connection to the Bishop Union School District, which gives 
our campus broadband capabilities.
 
With a 50/50 commitment from our STEP Foundation we were able to purchase 90 Chromeboo
ks for use from 3rd to 8th 
grade. Students in K
-
2 were given the older Acers. Every student has one to one access to computer technology. Retired 
Dell laptops are loaned to students yearly for home use.   Round Valley also has an open
-
use policy for techno
logy.
 
 
Utilizing Prop 39 funding, the school has undergone an energy conservation upgrade which included interior/exterior light 
retrofit, HVAC duct work modifications, window shades, thermostat replacement, interior lighting controls, and a solar 
panel in
stallation. Roof repair has been completed.
 
 
Various maintenance projects have renovated the storage shed, modernized data storage, created new student 
lockers/cubbies, added more convenient laptop storage, and added a  bear proof trash container. With sup
port from the 
Inyo County Office of Education, the school was resupplied with modern desks and chairs in every classroom focusing on 
collaboration.  The  security gates have been installed. An outdoor paging system was installed last year to support 
emerge
ncy communication to playground areas. Interior paging has been unproved in classrooms and bathrooms.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The success of th
e students at Round Valley Joint Elementary School District is the direct result of an extensive partnership 
with our community and our parents. Community support comes in many forms that include monetary gifts, donations of 
merchandise and services, and t
he contribution of time from the many volunteers that help at our school on a regular 
basis.
 
 
Round Valley Joint Elementary School District has a very successful Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), instrumental for 
providing assistance in the areas of class
room activities, planning and creating our annual Fall Festival, serving on 
decorating committees, and as dance chaperons, yearbook advisers, Student Council advisers, Science Fair judges, Spelling 
Bee coaches, and speech contest coaches, and athletic coac
hes. In addition, our parents are extremely valuable in the 
Round Valley School Art Program and Ski Program.
 
 
Round Valley Joint Elementary School District also has a School Site Council (SSC), which is made up of  parents, community 
members, and staff. Th
e SSC is utilized for the purpose of ongoing analysis of school data, continuous planning for school 
improvement, and the development of our LCAP. We encourage parent participation on the SSC and accept all 
nominations.
 
 
The Round Valley Joint Elementary S
chool District Student Enrichment Program (STEP) is another area where parents and 
community members work together to raise funding for enrichment opportunities at the school. This not for profit group 
has raised more than $300,000 to contribute toward tec
hnology, art programs, library improvement, field trips, cultural 
assemblies, and teacher requested materials.
 
 
Parents and community members are always invited to attend the Board Meetings held monthly.
 
 
The staff members at Round Valley School deeply app
reciate the tremendous support we receive from our community 
and parents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Security Plan goal is to provide information and direction for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of 
a safe, secure, and peaceful environment in which all students and staff may interact in the formal structure of schooling.
 
 
The Round Valley School Security Plan addresses the assignment of basic responsibilities to staff during an emergency; 
procedures and protocols in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency; and calls for regular fire, earthquake, and 
shelter in 
place drills.
 
 
The school staff, School Site Council (SSC), and School Board annually review the Round Valley School Security Plan. Every 
effort is made to ensure that our students and staff are free to learn and teach without the threat of 
physical and/or 
psychological harm.
 
 
The School Security Plan was last approved by the School Board on April 20, 2016. The School Security Plan is currently 
being reviewed by the Inyo County Sheriff's Department and suggestions are being 
incorporated. The School Security Plan 
was last reviewed and discussed with the school faculty in December, 2019. We have monthly fire drills, two earthquake 
drills, and two shelter in place drills yearly. In July 2018, the Sheriff's Department conducted i
nternal training drills utilizing 
Round Valley Campus, both improving their training and assessing our preparedness. On November 21, 2019, a 
coordinated lock down drill was conducted with the Sheriff's Department. Lessons learned will enhance the Security 
Plan 
and some facilities work will be done to improve safety.

services, workshops, and conferences. This allows our staff 
members to remain current regarding any changes or trends in their areas of expertise.
 
 
Round Valley Joint Elementary School District employs 8 full
-
time teachers and one part time teacher who 
are fully 
credentialed and are teaching within their subject area. Teachers, in cooperation with the superintendent/principal, 
establish annual performance goals and objectives, which they endeavor to attain during the school year. Professional 
development
 
opportunities are aligned with the annual performance goals and objectives.
 
 
Our district has provided in
-
service training in many areas, including the use of technology in the classroom, differentiated 
instruction, mandatory reporting procedures, first a

For the previous eight school years, we have had two days per school year for district directed training and two additional 
days per school year for staff selected training or conference atten
dance. In addition, we have an early release on 
Mondays, which provides an additional eight hours per month for professional collaboration and training as identified. 
This year teachers are being provided a 30 minute prep period several times a week so tha
t collaboration between grade 
levels can be accomplished.
 
 
The focus this year is on Next Generation Science Standards with a current year adoption in the works and the school is 
confident that the staff is well prepared for this shift in education.
