About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Cali
fornia is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data 
reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.go
v/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community mem
bers should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

from its most recent facility 
inspection in June 2018.  The district governi
ng Board has adopted cleanliness standards for all district schools to ensure that all schools are clean, safe 
and functional.  The district Operations Department takes great pride following a work order process that provides efficient 
and timely services 
to all the 
sites.  The principal works directly with the site custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure that the school is
 
clean and safe.
 
 

ng to all district schools.  The district performed 
Quick Strike projects during the summer of 2014, which allowed schools to pick from one of the following improvements: 1) mar
quees, 2) closed
-
circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior painting, 
or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district schools 
were upgraded.  Additional 10 million dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to beg
in in 2019.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including
 
ELA Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and 
Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through thi
s program deeply align with the needs of our individual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional in
structional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson
 
design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunit
y for teachers to engage in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instruct
ional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of 
responsibility.
