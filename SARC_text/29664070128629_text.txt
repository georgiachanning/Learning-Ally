Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Union Hill Elementary School District was established in 186
8, with only a few students in a one
-
room schoolhouse.
 
 
Since that time the district enrollment grew to over 800 students and now consists of a traditional K
-
8 program at Union 
Hill School, with student population of just over 700 students, and the Bearc

preschool and infant through eighth grade childcare program. The District continues to expand and modernize its facilities, 
new playground equipment, new roofs, and other property improvements. Even with the mo
dernization projects the 
district continues to provide a school environment that symbolizes its rich history and tradition.
 
 
Union Hill School District has a rich history beginning as a one room school in 1868, and growing into the trademark for 
excellenc
e in education that it is today. Our district features an outstanding preschool through eighth grade articulated 
and enriched academic program taught by staff who are devoted to the academic and personal well being of every 
student; and an acclaimed before
 
and after school extended child care program. Our integrated technology and art 
programs, band, choir, after school sports program, and the most supportive and productive Parent Teacher Club in the 
county enhance the high quality student learning in Union
 
Hill School District!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Union Hill 
Elementary School takes effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, 
the school uses a Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) as a survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The result
s 
of this surv
ey are avilable at the school district office.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
The maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A process is used to ensure efficient ser
vice and that emergency and safety
-
related repairs 
are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The Supervisor of Maintenance, Operations and Transportation works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a 
clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
Union Hill School District has a deferred maintenance plan to assist in budgeting for expenditures associated with major 
repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes ro
ofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
The district has created a schedule to implement projects that have been postponed beyond normal timelines due to 
curbacks in school funding
 
in recent years. In 2017 and 2018 school facilities improvements included: sewage system 
repairs/replacement, irrigation system repairs, heating
-
ventilation
-
air conditioning replacement, minor applicance 
replacement, parking safety features, preschool pla
yground equipment replacement, harmful brush and debris removal, 
fencing repairs, and roof replacment and repairs.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Family 
engagement is an essential strategy for supporting the success of all students. When the District focuses on building 
trusting relationships and connecting family engagement to student learning, and when it builds the capacity of educators 
and families to 
work together, family engagement leads to a school
-
family partnership that positively impacts student 
outcomes and help close achievement gaps.
 
 
Parents play an important role in Union Hill School through their active participation and involvement in the 
School Site 
Council, Parent Teacher Club (PTC), and Music and Sports Boosters Clubs. Each club adds unique programs and activities 
to our school culture.

Union Hill Middle School and the Union Hill School District have developed a comprehensive safety plan which identifies 
major safety concerns and 
delineates specific prevention and action activities including community and local law 
enforcement agencies. District personnel participate in monthly meetings with representatives of various public safety 
agencies and schools to keep current on local comm
unity safety issues. In conjunction with District Goals and Priorities, 
Union Hill's safety plan ensures a safe and secure campus by maintaining a positive learning environment that uses 
prevention strategies, such as Positive Behavior Interventions and Su

Program and emphasized high expectations for student conduct (Bearcat of Character). All staff wear name badges and 
all visitors to the campus are expected to check in at the office and receive a tempo
rary visitor badge. All staff has been 
trained in the identification of hazards and appropriate procedures for action. In 2017 the District installed security 
cameras that provide coverage and remote viewing of potential hazards.
 
 
 
The current safety plan 
was reviewed, revised and board adopted in March 2019.
