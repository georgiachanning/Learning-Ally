Principal's Message
 
The School Accountability Report Card is to provide 
parents with information about our educational 
programs, academic achievement, materials, facilities, and staff.
 
 
At El Dorado School, we are a community of learners empowering students as they develop a 
capacity for leadership, the ability to build relati
onships, a joy of learning, and the academic 
foundation for college and career readiness.
 
 
Our teachers provide instruction and assessment based on the California Common Core Standards 
and utilize the curriculum and resources adopted by the Stockton Unifie
d School District as well as 
supplemental technology supported resources. The students at El Dorado Elementary School 
benefit from a number of programs and strategies designed to address their individual needs. We 
strive to provide all students with the op
timal program that benefits their unique needs. We offer 
English language acquisition support, additional tutoring for at risk and our special needs 
population. We have a full time and a part time counselor and part
-
time therapist that provide 
support to s
tudents with their social
-
emotional development and attendance. We have partnered 
with Fathers and Families of San Joaquin for additional therapeutic support for our students and 
their families. FFSJ provides professional development to our staff on trauma
 
informed teaching 
practices, social emotional learning and equity. Our staff is committed to working collaboratively 
with our parents and the community to provide our students with an opportunity to grow 
academically, socially and emotionally.
 
 
In an effo
rt to create a culture of community and inclusion, El Dorado has implemented restorative 
practices school wide. This approach to student discipline is one that provides students with an 
opportunity to make amends when a mistake has been made and repair rel
ationships when harm 
has been done. Restorative conferences and other interventions based on the principles of 
restorative practices are used as an alternative to suspension. This systematic approach to student 
misbehavior provides logical consequences and
 
allows them to be welcomed back into the school 
community after harm has occurred. All members of the school community have a voice and the 
opportunity to be heard. Through daily/weekly "Classroom Circles", students build trust, develop 
healthy relationsh
ips and learn to communicate effectively with peers and adults. The goal is to 
keep kids in school and provide the support needed to shape positive behaviors. In addition, we 
have included additional social emotional learning and instruction through execut
ive functions and 
mindfulness activities which are embedded in academic instructional practices. We are continuing 
to align our practices to meet the needs of our students and have dedicated resources and created 
partnerships to become a trauma informed "h
ealing" school.
 
 
We have a large library with books to support preschool to eighth grade students. We host several 
mobile computer labs that can be accessed in the classroom. All computers have supplemental and 
intervention programs available for students 
who require additional support in English Language 
Arts and Math.
 
 
We are focused on building our parent teacher association into a strong and important component 
of our school. It will be instrumental in helping us build a solid partnership with families,
 
staff, and 
community members.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availab
ility of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whether 
those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with 

mes of the
 
textbooks used 
in our core classes and their dates of publication.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
El Dorado was built in 1977. Modernization was completed prior to the start of the 2010
-
2011 school year with the support of Measure C funds.
 
 
El Dorado School site has 25 classrooms 
to support our student population. We have a multipurpose room which supports our lunch program and school 
events. We had new heating and air conditioning units installed in 2008 and during the modernization in the 2009
-
2010 school year.
 
 
Our district main
tenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timel
y manner. 
A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
A sc
heduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, and facilities are well
-
maintained and in good 
repair. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean 
and safe school.
 
 
Stockton Unified takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, we
 
utilize the facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California OPSC. The full report is available u
pon request.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Note: Mathematics test results include the 

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met th
e standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of s
tudents in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students test
ed is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

School Safety Plan
 

ures the school facilities 
are in 
compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. In the event of a facility plant emergency, the principa
l notifies appropriate 
site and district personnel to resolve the emergency and safely secure or evacuate the students, based upon 
the site and district emergency preparedness 
plans. A site review with the district Internal Evaluation Instrument (IEI) occurs annually.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan, also called Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS), is updated ann
ually and reviewed by all 

procedures to follow during 
emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency drills are conducted on a regula
r basis. El Dorado's CSSP was last reviewed and approved on May 21, 2018.
 
 
Every effort is made to ensure students are monitored while on campus throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, campus saf
ety assistant, teachers, 
site administrators and other s
chool staff as assigned provide supervision for students before and during school. The playground is safe for all students 
and well supervised during recess time by certificated and classified staff. All visitors must sign in at the office and rece
ive prop
er authorization to be on 
campus, and must display their passes at all times.
