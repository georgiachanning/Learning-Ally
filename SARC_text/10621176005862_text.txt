District Mission Statement
 
To be a quality educational system providing the resources for all students to reach their potential 
in mind, body and spirit.
 
 
District Vision Statement
 
Clovis Unified School District strives to be 

 
 

 
Fort Washington Elementary is a high
-
achieving school whose mission is to provide a safe learning 
environment in which everyone collaborates to ensure students reach their full potential
 
in 
developing mind, body and character. The Fort Washington community is dedicated to maintaining 
an effective and efficient educational team of students, parents, educators, and community 
members to direct and facilitate the delivery of exemplary curricu
lar and co
-
curricular services. It 
is also our mission to prepare all individuals to successfully deal with the changing world and to 
become productive, contributing members of society.
 
 
Fort Washington has once again earned the Clovis Unified School Distr
ict (CUSD) Exemplary School 
Award for excellence in education and co
-
curricular programs. Fort Washington has much to be 
proud of this year. The Patriots continue to be some of the best
-
prepared students as they enter 
Kastner Intermediate School. In additi
on, the California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress (CAASPP) results have returned and proven, once again, that the Fort is the place to be. 
Last year, Fort Washington was named an Honor Roll school for the 2018
-
19 California Honor Roll 
and i
s a Digital Citizenship Certified school. The Fort Washington teachers and staff maintain high 
expectations, and students strive to meet these expectations.
 
 
In CUSD and at Fort Washington, we look at students individually and use their strengths and 
weakn
esses to prescribe instruction utilizing Teacher Grade Level Expectations (TGLEs). Through 
this process, teachers and site administrators examine standards
-
based, grade
-
level specific data 
on individual students and plan the next steps for instruction. In 
this way, teachers really 
differentiate their instruction to meet the needs of their students. With the implementation of the 
professional learning community (PLC) process, instruction has become even more targeted for 
individual student needs.
 
 
Working fo
r CUSD and Fort Washington is different than working for any other U.S. school district. 
Our teachers teach the California State Standards through district
-
adopted curriculum to a high 
level of mastery. There are more than 34 different co
-
curricular activi
ties in which Fort Washington 
students may participate, including athletics, school service, academic enrichment, humanities, 
music and the performing arts. It is the expectation that we teach the whole child and provide 
opportunities for every student to 
be involved. Parent involvement is strong at Fort Washington. 
Our Parent Association has been a dedicated group for more than four decades by providing 
financial, emotional and volunteer support to our school. Parents are also provided with many 
opportunit

special events that require parent involvement such as School Site Council (SSC), English Language 
Advisory Committee (ELAC), School Assessment Review Team (SART), Inte
rcultural and Diversity 
Advisory

being a three
-
time National Blue Ribbon School and four
-
time California Distinguished School, Fort Washington has received three awards 
for character education since 1992 and 
has earned nine CUSD Exemplary School Awards.
 
 
We are a proud school with a proud past, but the future we are providing for students is what makes Fort Washington the place
 
to be.
 
 
The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) was established by the passage
 
of Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters 
in November 1988. The SARC, issued annually by local school boards for each public elementary and secondary school in the sta
te, 
provides parents and other interested people with a variety of in
formation about the school, its resources, its successes and the areas in 
which improvements are needed. Some of the statistics reported in this SARC are from various school years but provides the mo
st current 
information available. If you have any questio
ns, please contact the school office at (559) 327
-
6600. Your input is always valued.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Melanie Hashimoto
 
 
About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

School Safety Plan
 
Our school safety plan addresses the emotional, physical and social safety of all students. On the 2018
-
19 SART survey, 91
 
percent of Fort Washington 
families indicated they think our school provides a safe environment for their child. Faculty and parents update and discuss 
our plan annually. Most 
recently, the school safety plan was updated in December 2019. Various safety d
rills are practiced with the students each month including lockdown, 
evacuation, fire and earthquake drills.

An effective process for staff development and curriculum improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrato
rs on an annual basis. 
Staff development activities are held prior to the beginning of the school year as well as throughout the ye
ar. Members of
 
the staff are directly involved in planning the development activities. The administration actively supports the program thro
ugh participation, allocation 
of time for staff development activities, and the use of fiscal and personnel resource
s. The staff
-
development program is consistent with the school goals 
for curriculum, instruction, assessment, and student achievement. Staff
-
development days that focused on meeting the needs of our increasingly diverse 
student population while evaluating 
data to drive instruction and sharing best practices, were held during the 2017
-
18 school year. Additionally, staff 
development is ongoing as we align the Common Core State Standards to curriculum and instruction. Staff members are currently
 
attending dist
rict and 
site in
-
services on best teaching practices as they relate to the Common Core. Specifically, staff development has focused on the eig
ht mathematics 
practices and how teachers can prepare students now using current state standards for the upcoming 
Common Core standards and subsequent 
assessments.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mast
ery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California 
Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018
-
19 school year, 
the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional develop
ment opportunities on staff 
development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also offered throughout the school 
year.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional 
development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible 
Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.

CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re
-
K 
-

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
 
2018
-
19 School Accountability Report Card for Fort Washington Elementary School

of

children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additiona
l assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activit
ies are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challen
ge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
