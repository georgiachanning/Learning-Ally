District, including charters. The school opened it's doo
rs on July 19, 2017 and is located in Otay 
Ranch, a middle socio

respected
, and incorporated into the school curriculum and activities.
 
 
Approximately 16% of our students are classified as English Language Learners (ELL's). Staff 
provides daily integrated and designated English Language Development (ELD) instruction centered 
on 
the English Language Development (ELD) Standards. Staff focuses specifically in speaking (oral 
language development), listening, reading and writing while utilizing the Benchmark and Adelante 
English Language Arts (ELA) support materials for English learne
rs. Additionally, ELL students are 
taught English instructional skills through a variety of Specially Designed Academic Instruction in 
English (SDAIE) and GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) strategies to ensure academic 
learning while students incre
ase English language fluency. As a tier of intervention, some teachers 
are using phonics and foundational reading skills are also taught systematically through SIPPS 
(Systematic Instruction in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and Sight Words). There is a h
eavy 
emphasis on the Listening and Speaking Common Core Standards where teachers implement 
structured strategies and routines. After receiving professional development, staff has been 
implementing Socratic Seminars to enhance Speaking and Listening skills.
 
Students have access to 
Accountable Talk, structured dialogue and rubrics to reinforce the expectations for Common Core. 
All students, including our English learners have access to Achieve 3000 and/or Imagine Learning  
(CELDT 1 and 2) daily to enhance lan
guage arts and ELD. Designated ELD supports all English 
Learners at all levels.  All classroom teachers have either a CLAD or BCLAD credential.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eli
gible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

The parents at Mu
raoka School are the foundation to the success of Muraoka. The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) will sponsor many projects f
or the 
benefit and enjoyment of our children. Many parents and members of the community volunteer in the classrooms, help the overa
ll school and assist 
with special events. The community feels welcomed and they actively support our school.  They recognize the importance of par
ent engagement as vital 

 
 
Currently, we offer programs that encourage parent involvem
ent and participation school
-
wide. Parents participate through the School Site Council (SSC), 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) and as classroom volunteers throughout the year
. Coffee Chats with 
the principal wil
l help maintain ongoing communication and build a strong home
-
school partnership. In addition, throughout the year Muraoka PTO 
offers many events that promote family engagement. A parent volunteer committee led by the PTO supports teachers and students
 
in 
the classroom. All 
cultures and languages are affirmed and respected at Muraoka Elementary School. We embrace diversity and promote acceptance, 
respect and tolerance.
 
 
Innovation, inclusion, collaboration and teamwork are the key to fostering our school's 
success. All stakeholders, students, parents, and staff will work 
together to enrich learning opportunities for our students and to make Muraoka a place of educational excellence and a 21st C
entury learning 
environment.
