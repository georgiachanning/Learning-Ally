School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In June 2019 the middle wing was found to have mold at varying degrees in each wing. In August 2019 major repairs were 
made to 3 of the classrooms in the 
middle wing with new flooring, wall and ceiling panels where needed. Room 11 was 
completely modeled with all new floors, ceilings and walls to create the new staff room. Cabinets and countertops were 
installed, and electrical was upgraded to handle the sch
ool copy machines and create a work room.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Before the start of the 2017
-
18 school year, we began with foundational Professional Development in Dual Immersion 
Research and Strategies and Common Core Standards in both Spanish and English.  We provided Professional 
Development in all curricular areas 
including Spanish Language Arts through Benchmarks Adelante, English Language 
Development through Imagine Learning, Eureka Math, ELD and Dual Immersion Strategies.  In order to develop a positive 
school culture, all staff participated in Professional Devel
opment in PBIS and Restorative Practices. Before the start of the 
2018
-
19 school year, all staff participated in the 6
-
day Project GLAD training in research based strategies for standards 
based, integrated thematic instruction, unit design and assessment, 
and 1 day of Math Corner curriculum PD.  Teachers 
are given 10 days of Professional Development before school begins in August, as well as 2 additional non
-
student PD days 
during the school year. In August 2019
-
20, all teachers participated in a 2
-
day Proj
ect GLAD refresher training, and 4 new 
teachers completed the entire 6 days of training in addition. Unfortunately the 2 non
-
student PD days were used as 
student days to make up for power outage school closures.
 
Every Wednesday, teachers meet for 3 hours f
or Professional Development and Collaboration. An Instructional Coach for 
ELD supports all teachers on an on
-
going basis throughout the school year, as well as a Math Coach who meets monthly 
with the staff for PD in Eureka Math and Math Corner implementati
on.
