School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019

ve 

each student.  Through exploration, direct experience and discovery each student can take ownership of his or her 
learning.  The stu
dent at Monarch is a self
-
directed learner who is able to demonstrate, articulate, and evaluate what he 
or she learns.  Monarch Education is developmentally appropriate, centered on language, mathematical, and science 
literacy, and is achieved through the 

 
 
Currently, we have 5 classrooms, with students from TK to 8th grade.  Monarch has just under 100 students this year.  We 
pride ourselves on knowing each and every student and their parents by nam
e.  This makes school a much more personal 
endeavor.  Having fewer students also gives us the ability to customize education for students who need something a little 
different.  We have created an environment where all students feel welcome and are free fr
om worrying about safety.
 
In the past year, we have concentrated on improving technology.  We have enough Chromebooks for each student.  We 
have invested in the Acellus Program, which will teach students coding along with having at least 300 other lessons 
in ELA 
Math, Science, History,y, and many more subjects.  These lessons can be used as a stand
-
alone in order for students to 
work at their current ability level, or as a classroom to enrich.direct instruction.  Monarch students go on at least one fie
ld 
tr
ip per month, field trips concentrate on the arts, sciences, or local history and community.

School Facility Conditions 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
After a snowstorm in February of 2019 we had a tree service come in and remove all dead and fallen trees.  In March of 
2019 Monarch had a busted water main that caused a floor in three of  our rooms.  One 
entire classroom and our office 
area and our multi
-
purpose room were completely remodeled.
 
Monarch is kept clean and all safety requirements are met.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

20 hours per year.  This can be done by supplying classroom supplies, field trips, helping in classrooms, and volunteering 
to help with recess and lunch break.  teacher
s are in constant communication with parents using Class Dojo, flyers phone 
call, and an all call phone and text system.  Parents are constantly encouraged to participate in their child's education.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Monarch Learning Center Safety Plan: Since we are a  very small school our safety plan is not complicated.  We have a fire 
drill monthly, and 
earthquake, and lock down drills quarterly.
 
In case of an emergency where we actually leave campus, we have emergency notebooks; it is the responsibility of our 
receptionist to grab these notebooks so we can call all parents.  We also maintain a one
-
call t
exting system to get ahold 
of all parents.  We have made arrangements with the church next door to give us a place to wait for emergency rides.

Here at Monarch Learning Center, we have several special programs that we bring in for our special education students.  
We have 
Occupational Therapy, Speech Theapy, and a group that comes in and works with special students on social skills, 
and appropriate school behavior.  We have a full time special education aide and will be adding another person to that 
program after the first 
of the year.  All students can benefit from tutoring and homework club if needed.  We also have 
many outside people who come in and run electives to give students more opportunities.
