About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC).
 
The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP)
, which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more inf
ormation about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

We believe that our student achievement and success are based upon a strong school and community partnership. Therefore, Ramo
na Elementary not

lvement, but also provides a wide variety of activities that allow for direct parent and community 
participation.
 
 
Parents, as members of the Booster Club, enrich the quality of our school climate. Our Booster Club and parent volunteers sup
port and promote
 
the 
following: Red Ribbon Week, school spirit, teacher/class support, assemblies, field trips, rewards and incentives, and fifth 
grade promotion activities. Our 
Title I program provides parent workshops and technology training.
 
 
Community involvement incl
udes support from area businesses and civic organizations in academic programs and student recognition activities. The 
School Site Council (SSC), African American Parent Advisory Committee (AAPAC) and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) a
lso strength
en parent 
participation by providing forums for input on matters such as curriculum, budget, support programs, and special services and
 
needs.

School Safety Plan
 
The comprehensive School Safety Plan includes, but is not necessarily limited to, assessing the current status of school crim
e committed on school 
campuses and at school related functions, identifying appropriate strategies and programs that will provide o
r maintain a high level of school safety, and 
addressing procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are held at least twice a year at the secondary schools and once a month at the elementary schools. Disaster and 
ear
thquake drills are conducted 
as needed. The School Safety Plan also includes the MVUSD discipline policy, which describes the consequences for student mis
conduct (such as 
detention, Saturday School, suspension, and expulsion).
 
 
The School Safety Plan was l
ast reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff in August 2019.
