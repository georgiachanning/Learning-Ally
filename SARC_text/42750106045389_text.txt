Description
 
Cuyama Elementary is a rural school serving students from a forty mile radius, covering three 
counties.  It is located in the scenic Cuyama Valley, educating kindergarten through eighth grade 
students taught by eight highly qualified teachers, 
one intervention teacher, and one special 
education teacher.  Three instructional assistants work closely with teachers to address student 
needs.
 
 
Cuyama Elementary School is dedicated to the ideals of academic excellence and to the personal 
and social dev
elopment of our students. Academic integrity is fostered in a climate which respects 
the unique needs of each individual. Our students develop a positive self
-
image, respect for the 
rights of others, and the ability to communicate effectively, think critic
ally, meet challenges, and 
accept responsibility.  Cuyama has the following expectations consistently reinforced in all 
classrooms and areas of the school:  Be Responsible, Excel Together, Actively Participate, Respect 
All, and Safety First.
 
 
Our staff is 
continually looking to meet the needs of our students, forty
-
six percent of whom are 
English Learners, and eighty
-
two percent who are socioeconomically disadvantaged.  Meeting 

ment.  One of 

our school and develop personal connections with staff.
 
 
Family involvement is increasing at Cuyama Elementary.  Many parents are active memb
ers in 
School Site Council, the English Learners Advisory Committee, the District Advisory Council, and the 

-
teacher conferences and campus events.  
We are continually seeking avenues to encourage
 
more family support.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cuyama Elementary School is situated on 20 acres, and includes two large grassy playgrounds and fifteen regular classrooms. A
 
new science lab was 
completed and the school received a new roof and paint in 2003. 
Additionally, new doors were installed to meet handicapped regulations, and the fire 
alarm system has been upgraded. New playground equipment was installed for the upper grades in the spring of 2002 and new pla
yground equipment 
was installed for the primar
y grades in the summer of 2013. The driveway and parking lot was repaved in the summer of 2017.  There is a Head Start Pre
-
School program housed on campus.  There is space for baseball, soccer, football, and track activities, as well as a cafeteria
/auditor
ium for performance 
events.
 
 
Our school meets most or all of the standards for good repair, established by the Office of Public School Construction. If we
 
have any deficiencies, they 
are not significant. We scored between 89 and 100 percent on the 15 categ
ories of our evaluation, with an overall percentage of 90.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., Calif
ornia Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
A Site Emergency Plan (Revised April 2018) is on file, and earthquake, fire, and lockdown drills are held regularly. While we
 
pride ourselves on our safe 
community, we ensure that 
emergency response procedures are in place. Faculty, staff, and students are trained to exit the school buildings safely. Sta
ff 
and administration worked collaboratively to develop an updated lockdown procedure with successful implementation. Classified
 
st
aff members are also 
trained to assist in case of an emergency. Staff is on duty and assigned to monitor all students both in classrooms and on th
e playground.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is the primary concern of Cuyama Elementary. The school is awa
re of and complies with laws and regulation regarding 
hazardous materials. Laboratory supplies are carefully housed, and their use is diligently monitored. A regularly scheduled m
aintenance program ensures 
classrooms, restrooms, and other facilities are ke
pt in good condition.

For the 
2017
-
2018 school year, teachers have been deepening their knowledge of the ELA curriculum adopted the previous year.  Based on stu
dent 
assessments and teacher input, support was provided by the Santa Barbara County Office of Education through after school 
workshops, along with in
-
class coaching.  The goal has been to differentiate instruction utilizing the new curriculum.  Cuyama Elementary initiated gr
ade span team meetings, 
partnering with special education, the intervention teacher, and administration to
 
examine individual students and brainstorm to better meet the 
students' needs, and to allow for more dialogue between the grades.  The school has also begun Next Generation Science Standa
rds (NGSS) training, with 
beginning implementation in the classrooms
.
 
 
Based on student data evaluation and teacher input, the focus for 2018
-
2019 was developing teacher skills in the area of social
-
emotional learning, with 
the main emphasis being on Universal Design for Learning (UDL).  Support has been provided by the Sa
nta Barbara County Office of Education in the 
form of individual coaching, after school workshops, and conference attendance.  Grade level span monthly meetings are conduc
ted to reflect on practice 
and student data, with the opportunity for colleagues to p
rovide support to each other.
 
 
Building on the foundation built in the previous year, professional development continues to focus on UDL.  Particular attent
ion has been paid to meeting 
the social
-
emotional needs of students and developing a growth mindset.
  
Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) training has occurred over the past 
two years. Teachers are supported through coaching sessions and after school workshops.
