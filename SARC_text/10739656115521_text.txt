About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, 
Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repair, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currentl
y approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent SBE adoptions and support
 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student, including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations ha
ve their own textbook. In the case of class sets, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitment of the
 
district administration 
and the governing board and are not the produ
ct of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, 
administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. The Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees and Educational Services.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Pri
ority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

calculated by taking the 
total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Liddell Emergency Response Plan was prepared in compliance with Central Unified School District Governing Board Policy an
d California 
Administrative Code, Title 5, California Education Se
ction 560, which requires all public schools, transitional kindergarten through community college, to 
have written emergency response plans which will be reviewed at least annually by the local governing board. This plan was de
veloped and approved in 
coope
ration with state, county, city, and district civil emergency response staff. Cooperation with these agencies is essential in
 
times of an emergency. 
This plan is devoted to the welfare and safety of the students of Liddell Elementary School during school h
ours. It includes a procedure whereby the 
school could be used, under disaster conditions, as a community resource for the care of people. The major objectives of emer
gency response procedures 
are to save lives and protect property in the event of a disast
er. This plan was developed with these objectives in mind.  The plan was last revised in 
August 2019 and reviewed with the School Site Council and ELAC.  The staff last reviewed and practiced it in August 2019 and 
will review and practice it 
again in Febru
ary 2020.  EPRs will be created to ensure the entire staff is present.  Once a month during professional development, safety 
information 
will be discussed with staff. Quarterly, safety scenarios will be performed by the staff during professional developmen
t. The School Site Council reviewed 
and approved the plan in September 2019.  The plan includes staff assignments, contingency scenarios,  drill guidelines, and 
evacuation locations.  
Through the course of the year, we practice lockdown, earthquake, and fi
re drills.   We have practice drills during class, recess, and Physical Education. 
Once a year a drill will include implementing Plan B, communication through radios and the use of Remind app.
