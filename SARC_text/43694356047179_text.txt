At Quimby Oak, we be
lieve in choice. We are keen to the needs of our students and fundamentally 
understand that learners are unique. Quimby is proud to offer parents and students two 
instructional program choices. Whether you select the Lobo Comprehensive Program (LCP) or Lob

School of Innovation (LSI), an exciting two
-
year experience awaits. By providing choice between a 
fully project
-
based program, and a rigorous comprehensive program, our students are offered 
cutting edge opportunities that prepare them for the demands of 
high school, college and career. 
Our guarantee is that both choices deliver students an excellent academic experience where 
students can master the Evergreen Profile of a Learner attributes of being a learner, advocate, 
communicator, collaborator, critical
 
thinker, and innovator before leaving us to the next phase of 
their educational journey.

-
Based Learning model that offers 
students a 1:1 digital learning environment with co
-
taught classr
ooms. LSI is partnered with the 
New Tech Network, a network of schools, that is dedicated to transforming teaching and learning 
around the country. LSI meets both CCSS and NGSS requirements through collaborative projects in 
all core courses. Students in LS
I continue to participate in campus wide electives and PE classes to 
promote integration across the campus. Students interested in music have the opportunity to 
participate in Concert Band, Symphonic Band, and Jazz Ensemble. Through Project
-
Based Learning,
 
LSI ignites mastery of five student outcomes: Knowledge & Thinking, Written Communication, Oral 
Communication, Collaboration and Agency.
 
 

NGSS standard integration. LCP is an anchored program offering students rigorous and meaningful 
learning opportunities. Each LCP student is offered diverse elect
ive choice, PE, and four core 
courses. Students in LCP have the opportunity to enroll in options like: wrestling, volleyball, art, hip 
hop dance, yearbook, coding, peer advisory, and more. Students have daily access to technology 
making digital learning op
portunities rich and engaging. Language Arts, Social Studies / History, 
Math and Science classes support students to build strong communication skills and challenge deep 
critical thinking.
 
 
The pillars of Quimby Oak Middle School are to develop Leadership,
 
to Own your choices, to be 
Respectful, to be Open
-
minded and Studious. That is our LOBOS Anthem.  In 2018, we launched 
our school

nd honored for demonstrating our school
-
wide 
values. The purpose of school wide PBIS is to establish a climate in which appropriate behavior is 
the norm and encourages good character and values by all students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accounta
bility Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported i
n the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP,
 
see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the

Quality, 
Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school within the district has 
sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and ins
tructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in 
the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned with the C
alifornia State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typicall
y adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional material
s used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review 
material
s in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting aligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Quimby Oak Middle School, originally constructed in 1968, is currently 
comprised of 37 permanent classrooms, eight portable classrooms, two computer 
labs, a library, a gymnasium, a staff lounge, and an athletic field.
 
During the 2017
-
2018 school year, a new two story facility was added to the campus offering six new classroom
s, one conference room, and additional 
staff and student restroom facilities.
 
 
The school has been thoroughly modernized over the past decade. Renovations occurred in 2007 and included remodeling of the s
cience classrooms, 
student restrooms, upgrading of c
ampus sidewalks, and new construction of the library, faculty room, and office. The blacktop was expanded in fall 2008 
and eight new portables were added for the Math Department over the summer of 2008.  In 2012, a room was remodeled into a Pro
ject Based L
earning 
classroom.  The chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Quimby Oak Middle School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted 
cleaning standards 
for all 
schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on
 
classrooms and restrooms. 
A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-
free. The princ

sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.

Maintenance & Repair:
 

ial staff on a regular basis, with heavy maintenance functions 
occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure th
at school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. A work 
order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State Schoo
l Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heat
ing, air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided sch
ool districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to m
itigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities ar
e clean, safe and in good repair.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

ing break, and after school 
by teachers and administrators. Lunch 
supervision is provided by noon
-
duty aides and administrators. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the main 
office and wear a visitor

s pass at all times during their stay on school grounds. There is also a designated area for student drop

front of the school.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated in November of 2019 by the School Site Council. It will be reviewed
 
again this winter with a 
revision submission date of February 7, 2020. Any and all revisions t
o the plan are immediately communicated to classified and certificated staff. 
 
 
Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following:

Policies related to suspension/expulsion
 

 
Disaster procedures/routine & emergency drills
 

 
Safe ingress & egress of pupils, parents, & school employees
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulation
s pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school

s disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lock down drill

Using state testing data and school surveys, Quimby Oak Middle School will be focusing on math concepts and procedures, demon
str
ating understanding 
of literary and non
-
fictional text, and school culture.  Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences an
d 
workshops throughout the year such as strategies for English Language Learners, Culturall
y and Linguistically Responsive Teaching, Special Education IEP 
Training, College Preparatory Mathematics, Project Based Learning, and Next Generation Science Standards.  For the past three
 
years, the district has 
sponsored staff development days annually 
where teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, 
teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Additionally, Quimby Oak Middle School is specifically dedicated to the development 
of Restorative Justice 
practic
es, including the implementation of circles, to strengthen student and teacher relationships, to build stronger connections w
ith students, and to 
develop practices that focus on building positive culture on campus. Restorative Justice in schools is a set o
f principles and practices that build community 
and involve processes that restore relationships when harm has occurred. Restorative Justice practices support and compliment
 
current school initiatives 
and can be used to positively impact school culture, di
scipline, and academic needs. Quimby Oak Middle School, along with other Evergreen School 
District sites,  is also implementing Positive Behavior Interventions & Supports (PBIS) and participating in training run via
 
Santa Clara County Office of 
Education. 
A leadership team has been designed for the implementation, support, coaching, and training needed for teachers in Restorativ
e Justice and 
PBIS. Quimby is a pilot school for Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) and continues to focus on building academic
 
and behavior success for all 
students.
