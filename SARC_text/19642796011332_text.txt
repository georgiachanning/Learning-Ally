School Description
 
The staff at Valleydale Elementary School is very committed to increasing student 
achievement by 
offering quality instruction through such programs as DBQ (document
-
based questioning), PLC 
(professional learning communities), and quality intervention/ enrichment.  Our academic focus is 
centered around creating an instructional environme
nt where students are provided daily 
collaborative practices, instruction supports cognitive rigor, and students are engaged in academic 
discourse. Valleydale staff works to increase rigor in daily instruction by providing opportunities to 
collaborate arou
nd complex tasks, text, and problems.  This focus has lead the staff to create 
higher
-
level questions throughout the curriculum and across content areas to ensure that all 
students have an opportunity to engage in critical thinking. Instruction at Valleyda
le is centered 
around student opportunities to experience the Four Cs; collaboration, critical thinking, 
communication and creativity. These experiences will help students to be prepared for the 
demands of college and careers in the 21st Century. In additi
on, we have a CCSS aligned English 
Language Arts and math curriculum. Students are supported with differentiated instruction 
through our school
-
wide intervention block. English Language learners are afforded both daily 
designated and integrated English Lan
guage Development instruction. In order to create a positive 
learning environment, we have implemented Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports, PBIS.  
Staff, students, and the community are encouraged to follow three behavior expectations; show 
respec
t, solve problems, and make smart choices.  Students are recognized for positive behavior 
choices and are motivated through incentive programs. Our staff recognizes the important role that 
self
-
esteem plays in the success of each child. In partnership with
 
McKinley Center and other 
agencies, we provide counseling services for students on campus.
 
 
We are committed to providing our students and parents with a quality instructional program.  We 
are proud to offer:
 
 

 
Emphasis on a Common Core standards 
instructional program in English, Math and Science
 

 
Focus on high expectations and achievement for ALL students

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Parents and community members are very supportive of the educational program at  Valleydale Elementary School. Parents and th
e community 
participate in parent nights, parent workshops, Coffee with the Principal, School Site Co
uncil, English Language Advisory Committee, Back to School Night, 
Open House, parent
-
teacher conferences as well as other school
-
wide events. An essential responsibility of the School Site Council is the approval of the 


curriculum. Parents are included in the planning, review, and improvement of programs through organized, ongoing School Site 
Council meetings. As a 
scho
ol site that receives Title I funding, an annual meeting is held to inform parents about the Title I program and its requirem
ents. Regular meetings are 
held to provide an opportunity for open dialogue between stakeholders regarding student achievement, as 
well as topics related to school performance, 
curriculum, assessments, and proficiency levels. Parents have also had the opportunity to participate in the Families in Scho
ols program which focuses 
on parent engagement and parent leadership. These workshops
 
are lead by parent leaders who work to provide our families the literacy skills that will 
support student academic achievement. Additionally, parent workshops are provided based on identified needs from school and d
istrict

Parents also volu

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC prov
ides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is one of
 

student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, lockdown, and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout t
he school year. Ann
ually, the 
school practices a complete district
-
wide earthquake drill, which includes an entire school evacuation. Teachers, staff, and administrators are trained 
and practice lockdown procedures that, in an emergency, can secure the entire campus. Additio
nally, staff has participated in ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, 
Inform, Counter, Evacuate) training which is a research
-
based approach to respond to an imminent threat situation.
 
 
A storage bin located at the school contains food, water, and other 
supplies for use during a disaster. All visitors must sign in at the front office,  wear 
identification tags while on the school grounds and sign out upon departure. Teachers and administrators are on duty during r
ecess and before school. 
Our noon supervis
ors and administrators are on duty during lunch and after school to ensure the safety of all students.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the Safe School Committee in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997
. The plan provides 
student
s and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan inc
lude the 
following: monthly facility safety inspections; child abuse reporting procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils
 
procedures; disaster response 
procedures; procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; sexual harassment policy; suspension and expulsion pol
icies; dress code; and 
discipline policies. Valleydale Elementary School
-
aligned the safety program 
with Positive Behaviors Interventions and Supports.   The School Safety 
Committee and School Site Council evaluates the plan annually and updates the plan as needed.

Our Valleydale teachers have undergone many hours of professional development to bring 
research
-
based teaching strategies into every classroom.  
Teachers collaborate weekly in our Professional Learning Communities model, which focuses on effective instructional strategi
es including the best use 
of student data at least times per month. Topic
s are decided through leadership team meetings and through annual staff surveys that identify areas of 
interest and needs. In addition, statewide SBAC assessment data help to guide the areas our educators must focus on in terms 
of staff development. 
During
 
the PLC process teachers regularly develop formative assessments and to share work samples. Based on the data analysis teache
rs modify 
instruction to best support students. Additionally, teachers have the opportunity to share best teaching practices and t
o reflect on their own instruction.
 
 
The district annually holds professional development days in which teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional learning opportunities in 
curriculum and instructional practice in support of a 
continuous cycle of improvement. Professional learning opportunities include grade level and/or 
content
-
specific programming on full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data co
ntinues to be the 
determini
ng factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last 
three years have been 
in the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history
-
social science, and science cu
rricula, content standards, frameworks, as 
well as the use of student data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by dist
rict staff, Teachers on Special 
Assignment, as well as consultants and coaches who speci
alize in content
-
area pedagogy. Professional learning is structured in job
-
embedded workshops 
and professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and c
oaching support, and 
student work/dat
a analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes strategies and pedagogy to support all learners access rigorous, 
grade
-
level 

elopment of academic language 
and literacy.
 
 
Beginning in 2017 through 2020, all teachers participated in six days of systematic, district
-
wide professional learning with a focus on instructional 
strategies in support of our three student success drivers: 
academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive rigor. In addition, several opt
-
in days 
of various ongoing professional learning offerings were held to differentiate among grade and content levels and included sta
ndards
-
aligned instructional 
pra
ctices in support of all learners, including English learners and students with disabilities; college and career readiness; a
