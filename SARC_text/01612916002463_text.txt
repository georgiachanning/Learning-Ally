School Description
 

 
Woodrow Wilson Elementary School is a community of learners who share a committed focus on 
ensuring that every child who comes to our school receives an equitable education within a 
nurturing and safe environment. The strength of our school lies with the s

embrace the skills that will make them lifelong learners. Our teaching faculty of highly qualified, 
fully credentialed teachers is dedicated to t
eaching rigorous core academic curriculum based on 
the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards that ensure access 
for all of our student subgroups. Educators at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School collaborate and 
analyze data reg
ularly to produce deeper learning opportunities for our students that includes an 
analysis of academic performance and language development to determine EL student program 
needs as well as other student subgroups needs. We believe that focused practices le
ad to stronger 
results! Our goal is to make continuous year to year growth for each individual student, so that all 
are prepared for middle school, high school, and beyond for college and career. Education requires 
teamwork. The Wilson staff, teachers, fam
ilies, community members, and students will continue 
to communicate clearly and work effectively to enable our students to meet the Common Core 
standards and to achieve our school
-
wide site plan goals and objectives.
 
 
Woodrow Wilson School is made up of a 
rich and diverse student body. The school serves students 
in grades TK
-
5. Additional resources are allocated to serve students in need of Math and Reading 
Intervention support services. Support services are also offered in English Language Development 
inst
ruction, Speech and Language, Special Education Resource Program, Adaptive Physical 
Education, Occupational Therapy, and Counseling. Students also receive instruction in Music, Art, 
and Physical Education taught by Specialists.
 
 
The Woodrow Wilson staff is
 
committed to providing an educational program in which the school's 
resources and services are effectively coordinated to meet the needs of students. Our teachers 
strive to provide students with explicit direct instruction lessons and project
-
based learni
ng (PBL) 
opportunities that are combined with blended learning opportunities in our 1:1 (1st
-
5th Grade) and 
2:1 (Kindergarten) digital learning environments. It is always our goal to provide academic 
programs that are culturally responsive, rigorous, perso
nalized and appropriately challenging for 
all students.
 
 
Instruction is focused on English Language Arts and Mathematics Common Core State Standards 
and Next Generation Science Standards as all students make progress toward mastery. Teachers at 
Woodrow Wilson Elementary School differentiate their instruction by regularly assessing and 
grouping students within and/or outside of the classroom for instruction in a variety of core 
academic content areas. Through this process, teachers are able to wor
k together to meet the 
needs of all students by sharing resources and best instructional practices. This has become a focus 
by aligning activities to achieve school goals through improving the academic performance of 
English learners students and students 
who require additional intervention to support their 
learning needs. Recognizing the need to focus on the whole child, our teachers also provide learning 
experiences that foster social/emotional growth as well as develop students' communication and 
collabo
ration skills.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet an
nual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/
ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members 
should contact the school principal or the district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three throu
gh eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
signif
icant cognitive disabilities); and

) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi

Wilson is dedicated to engaging parents in a variety of ways. The Wilson staff believes in building engaging, collaborative p
artnerships with our families 
and community members. Staff members encourage parents/guardians to par
ticipate in and out of the classroom on an ongoing basis throughout the 
year.  Kindergarten and TK teachers meet with parents prior to the start of the school year to welcome new families to our sc
hool. Staff communicates 
regularly with families through ne
wsletters, phone calls, emails, auto
-
text programs, in
-
person meetings, and emails. Many staff utilizes teacher 
webpages and online outreach programs to connect with families. Parents/guardians receive multilingual school and classroom n
ewsletters on a reg
ular 

 
system are 
multilingual. Parent volunteers are encouraged to work in classrooms around the school through our volunteer sign
-
up policies.  Twice a month Coffee 
Chats with the Principal provide the open format to receive information and ask pertinent questions on an ongoing basis. Pare
