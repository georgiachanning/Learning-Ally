By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's Message
 
The River Oaks staff takes great pride in creating a culturally sensitive school environment that is safe, nurturing, caring,
 
and intellectually challenging.  High standards have been 
set for behavior and academic personal growth.  Students are 
recognized and rewarded daily, weekly, and monthly for demonstrating the Eight Great Character Traits in their school 
work and personal interactions with adults and peers.  We believe it is impor
tant for students and parents to have a voice 
and to feel a sense of ownership and pride in their school.  Students have many opportunities to participate in 
extracurricular activities such as:  Student Council, Cross Age Tutoring, Band, Choir, After Schoo
l Clubs, and Running Clubs.  
Parents are encouraged to volunteer in and out of the classrooms.  They support teachers and contribute to our positive 
school community in many ways.  We are thankful for a very active and supportive PTA, English Language Advi
sory 
Committee, and School Site Council.  All students are challenged to meet individual growth goals and to perform to the 
best of their abilities.  Individual strengths and talents are recognized in all learners.  There are many opportunities for 
student
s to use their strengths and talents at school.  The teachers and support staff at River Oaks are dedicated to student 
achievement towards meeting Common Core State Standards.  Teachers, specialists, and administration collaborate on a 
regular basis to pro
vide a personalized, standards
-
based education for all learners.  Careful and precise data analysis of 
state and local assessments drive instruction and the needs for enrichment and remedial interventions.  We are proud to 
report that River Oaks has been r
ecognized as a California Distinguished School in 1995, 2002, 2008, 2018, and 2020.

August, 2019
 
 
Galt Joint Union Elementary held a Public Hearing on August 28, 2019, and determined that each school within the district 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement 
of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
sup
plementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recomm
endation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality
, currency, and availability of the standards

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The district has developed a comprehensive emergency plan in conjunction with the Galt Police and Fire Departments, 
which describes specific procedures for all types of 
emergencies. The plan is updated every fall and spring.
 
 
Our school site Emergency Handbook outlines the plan of action for emergencies such as earthquakes, fires, floods, 
lockdowns, and chemical spills.  Our school site has an evacuation plan and emergenc
y drills are conducted monthly.  We 
have a site crisis team that meets in August and September to review emergency procedures and protocols.  We have an 
emergency phone tree system to call classrooms and staff.  Staff are trained on emergency procedures in
 
August and 
September each year.  Periodic, random school safety inspections are conducted by the Schools Insurance Authority of 
Sacramento County.  Visitors to the campus are required to check in and out at the office and wear a visitor badge while 
on cam
pus.

Typ
es of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-

Supplemental programs and services at River Oaks that support and assist our learners include: 
 

 
Our school currently has a team of eight instructional assistants that provide additional reading and math 
skills 
practice in small groups. We focus these supports and interventions primarily in our TK
-
3rd grades. However, 
depending upon the need, our instructional assistants provide intervention in grades 4th
-
6th, as well. 
Instructional assistants are provided
 
training throughout the year based on the needs of our learners. This 
training is completed by our district curriculum coaches and site administration.
 

 
Extended day services are offered two days a week after school. Teachers and instructional assistants s
upport 
students with reading, science, and math.
 

 
Free after school meals are offered to all students.
 

 
Approximately fifty families have been chosen to check out a Chromebook with Wi
-
Fi services for home use.
 

 
The Bright Future Learning Center (BFLC) is util
ized as an enrichment hub which offers and supports blended 

The BFLC is open Monday 
-
 
Friday from 8:00 a.m. 
-
 
4:00 p.m.
 

 
Our school social worker 
program helps to keep children supported through their school years. Though school 
dropouts are rare in the elementary grades, enough knowledge exists to be able to identify the children who 
are at
-
risk of dropping out of school at a later age. Our social 
worker is responsible for various programs aimed 
at reducing or eliminating the high risk factors that interfere with student learning. Our social worker provides 
support to our students and staff, support to our families, works with attendance interventio
n, and provides 
on
-
going workshops for parents and staff.
 

 
Health services are under the supervision of a qualified school nurse. Vision screening, hearing tests, first aid 
and health counseling are among the services. Our district nurse, along with our sch
ool health clerk, is available 
to address health problems that interfere with the learning process.
