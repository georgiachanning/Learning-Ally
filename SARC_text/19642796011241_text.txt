School Description
 
Murray Elementary is one of nine elementary schools within the Azusa Unified School 
District. We 
are a Preschool
-
5th Grade Structured English Immersion Elementary School that serves 470 
students.  In 2018 we were recognized as a California Gold Ribbon School putting forth exemplary 
effort in ensuring all students are ready for 21st centur
y college or careers.  We believe that Murray 
exists to provide an effective educational program and to offer all students opportunities to 
develop their capabilities to the maximum of their potential so that they become contributing 
citizens in our changi
ng society. Murray has a strong academic foundation, a parent community 
that is interested and is actively involved, a faculty professionally skilled and personally committed 
to meeting the needs of students and a student body motivated to perform well. At
 
Murray we 
hold high expectations for every student every day.
 
 
Our school has a strong instructional leadership team which includes the principal, resource 
teacher, classroom teachers, classified staff, and parents. The teachers and instructional aides 
co
ntinuously receive staff development training in methods and strategies to assist them in 

policy and dress code are key factors in providing students with 
a positive learning environment. 


 
 
Every classroom has advanced computer and internet technology.  First through fifth grade 
classrooms have 
a chrome cart with enough Chromebooks for each student.  First Grade classrooms 
have access to Chromebooks daily and kindergarten classrooms have access to a set of desktops in 
the classroom in addition to i
-
Pads for each student.  Every student has access
 
to our school library 
which has a collection of over 15,000 books and a state of the art computer lab with 55 computers. 
To meet student needs, all of our teachers and instructional aides work together on a daily basis to 
plan and provide intervention pro
grams for every student who is not at grade level and to provide 
enrichment programs for every student that is above grade level. Our students also benefit from 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program, CHAMP, California Common Core aligned 
curriculum,
 
and a part time intervention teacher. At our school site you will always find a growing

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Onl
y eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with

School Safety Plan
 

paredness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety 
during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a monthly basis throughout the school year. Twice a year, the sc
hool practices a complete 
earthquake drill, which includes an e
ntire school evacuation. A storage bin located at the school contains food, water, and other supplies for use during 
a disaster. Murray has a closed campus.  All visitors must sign in at the front office, wear identification tags while on the
 
school ground
s and sign out 
upon departure. Teachers are on duty before school and during recess.  Noon aides monitor the campus during lunch and after s
chool dismissal to ensure 
the safety of all students. Teachers, staff, and administrators are trained and practice l
ock down procedures to secure the entire campus, ALICE (Alert, 
Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) procedures, which is a research based approach to respond to an active shooter situation
.
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan was developed by the Safe Scho
ol Committee in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997.  The plan provides 
students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety
 
Plan include the 
following: monthly facility safe
ty inspections; child abuse reporting procedures; teacher notification of dangerous pupils procedures; disaster response 
procedures; procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; sexual harassment policy; suspension and expulsion pol
icies; dre
ss code; and 
discipline policies. The Safe School Committee evaluates the plan annually and updates the plan as needed.
