School Description
 
 
Luther Elementary School, which is located on the west side of the town of Live 
Oak, puts forth its 
personal best to foster educational growth and community relationships.  Our school's many 
programs allow for high expectations for student achievement and offer experiences for students 
in the form of high quality instruction, after sc
hool program, intervention programs, and support 
services.  Academically, Luther has received many prestigious awards such as the Title 1 Academic 
Achievement Award, the California Gold Ribbon Schools Award, and the AVID Teacher Advocacy 
Award.   Luther Sc
hool's dedicated staff is constantly focused on creating a safe and positive 
learning environment in which students are challenged to be good citizens and achieve 
academically.  At Luther Elementary School, our teachers utilize a comprehensive district ado
pted 
curriculum that aligns with the requirements set forth in the California Common Core Standards.  
Staff Development is a priority, and teachers are continuously incorporating areas of professional 
development and model the role of life
-
long learners.  
We place a heavy emphasis on AVID by 
preparing our students for college and careers early on by embedding essential skills into our 
instruction on a daily basis.
 
 
During the past three years, Staff Development focused on English Language Development, readi
ng 
comprehension, Advanced Grammar Strategies, technology in the classroom, AVID, and 
mathematics. Support mechanisms are in place to help all students improve academically. 
Response to Intervention (RTI) classes provide identified students targeted instru
ction in reading 
and math.  Robotics and Advanced Music classes are offered at the third and fourth grade level for 
high achieving students, and English Language Development Classes are provided for students 
learning English. Ongoing analysis of student as
sessment data helps teachers differentiate and 
refine their classroom instruction in order to meet specific student needs.  Data is analyzed 
extensively at PLC meetings and at staff meetings.
 
 
Our classrooms are equipped with essential technological tools 
such as smart projectors, document 
cameras, and student computers.  In first through fourth grade, each student is provided with a 
Chrome Book to use in the classroom.  In Kindergarten, we have ten Chrome Books available in 
each class for use during worksh
op and for computerized assessments.
 
 
The Luther Library holds over four thousand Accelerated Reader fiction and non
-
fiction books.  
Accelerated Reader is a motivational and engaging reading program for students that allows them 
to take a test and earn poi
nts after reading a book.  Students are welcome to take quizzes in their 
classroom or in the library during their library time or at lunch recess.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a comprehensive School Safety Plan has 
been developed by the Live Oak Unified School District Safety 
Committee. The Plan is updated annually and covers various safety procedures including playground supervision, school safety,
 
and emergency 
procedures. Safety drills are held on a regular basis;
 
fire drills are held monthly, while earthquake drills and intruder alerts are held once per year.
 
 
Staff members are updated annually on their Safety Plan responsibilities. Teachers train their students on the proper procedu
res and responses to various 
si
gnals and drills used for emergency preparedness. All classes have on display the district Emergency Preparedness Guidelines 
flip chart. This flip chart 
is reviewed with staff annually.
 
 
All visitors to Luther Elementary School are required to sign in at t
he office and wear a visitor's pass at all times. Playground supervision is provided by 
teachers, support staff, yard duty supervisors, and administration to ensure the safety of each student before school, during
 
recess breaks, during lunch, 
and after sch
ool.
 
 
Local law enforcement and the Live Oak Unified School District Superintendent have helped develop a county emergency prepared
ness guide to ensure 
the safety of students and staff.
