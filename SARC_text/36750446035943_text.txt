By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

scores.

number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who 
met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both as
sessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of 
students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number 
of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentage
s are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Parent and community partnerships are important to the staff at Joshua Circle Elementary. To align our instructional 
practices with the parents and community needs, we have 
established Teacher for the Day, as well as the Joshua Circle 
Vision Coalition (JCVC). The Teacher for the Day and JCVC are made up of parents, community members, and staff for the 
purpose of developing a school wide vision and aligning our educational pra
ctices to that vision. Parents are also 
encouraged to volunteer in the classroom, help with school events, tutoring programs, and be involved in the decision
-
making process through school committees. The School Site Council, Parent Teacher Club, English La
nguage Advisory 
Council, Back to School Night, community nights, Parenting Classes, and Innovation Nights are a few ways we offer for 
parent and community involvement.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around the Common Core State 
standards and the 21st century learning 
skills.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training sponsored by the distric
t 
and school site. During the 2019
-
20 school year, the district provided staff development buy
-
back days. Each school site
 
identifies and coordinates its own staff development activities based upon individual student needs, school site plans, and 
the district's designated focus areas. Supplemental training involving curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies 
in the co
ntent areas of reading/language arts and math were provided at site request via Coordinator of Staff Development 
and Academic Coaches. There has been a total of approximately 40 days of professional development provided to our 
staff for the 2018
-
19 school 
year.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the staff and site leadership team. Training programs and topics were 
chosen based upon the school focus and student needs. Results for the Grade level single assessments, common formative 
assessments, t
eacher feedback, and findings from classroom observations help identify areas for improvement and 
training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based education fostering 
student success and proficiency.
 
 
The di
strict supplements site

-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on Common Core State standards and the 21st Century Learning Skills. Supplemental professional development 
is offered throughout the sc
hool year on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff 
development topics and focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the district's Professional 
Development Committee, Principals' Roundtable, and teac
her survey results. The Principals' Roundtable provides 
opportunities for school principals to discuss and share training needs based upon data analysis and classroom 
observations from each school site.
