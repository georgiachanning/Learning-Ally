By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School 
Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Principal's Message:
 
Twin Lakes seeks to provide a high
-
quality instructional program that focuses on skills that are required to be successful 
in college and career.  Our staff is 
dedicated to the success of each student and differentiates instruction based on specific 
student need and ability.  Our goal is to see students go on and participate in rigorous classes in both the middle and high 
school level that will translate in more 
opportunities later in life.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
The mission of Twin Lakes Elementary, dedicated to developing creative and innovative thinkers, is to ensure all students 
become collaborative, confident problem solvers through a high
-
quality, balanced acad
emic program, integrating fine arts 
and fitness, while developing compassionate life
-
long learners in partnership with our community.
 
 
School Profile:
 
Twin Lakes Elementary School is a TK
-
6 school with a focus on developing the whole child through academic
s, fine arts, 
and fitness in order for children to reach their full potential.  We believe that children need the opportunity to express 
themselves in many ways: through writing, movement, music,as well as visual and performing arts.  The staff at Twin Lak
es 
is committed to teaching students the skills they will need to be successful in the twenty
-
first century.  These "survival 
skills" include: critical thinking & problem solving, collaboration & leading by influence, agility & adaptability, initiativ
e & 
e
ntrepreneurialism, effective oral & written communication, accessing & analyzing information and curiosity & 
imagination.  In order for students to learn these skills, they need exposure and opportunities beyond the basic academic 
skills.  We provide these
 
opportunities through comprehensive balanced literacy in language arts and across the 
curriculum and engage students in enrichment classes during, before, and after school hours.  By partnering and working 
collaboratively with parents and community member
s, we can provide the best, comprehensive educational experience 
for all children.
 
 
SCHOOL PROGRAMS:
 
Technology:
 
We have one computer lab at Twin Lakes, which is adjacent to our library.  The computer lab provides students the 
opportunity to access 
information in multiple ways.  Teachers bring their classes during scheduled times and the students 
can complete research projects in many academic areas by using the library and internet resources. Additionally, we have 
14 COW (computer on wheels) carts, 
one in each 2nd 
-
 
6th grade class, which allow students to access technology and 
online academic programs.  All students are encouraged to check
-
out books from the library and to read at every 
opportunity.
 
 
Comprehensive, Balanced Literacy:
 
Comprehensive l
iteracy is the focus of our school.  Our approach to accomplish high
-
quality personalized instruction is 
through the gradual release of responsibility model.  Through the use of interactive read
-
alouds, shared reading/writing, 
guided reading and independen
t reading/writing, teachers are able to assist students in their learning in a personalized 
way.  Students are regularly assessed by teachers so that there is a clear understanding of what students know and are 
able to do.  These skills are essential for s
uccess in college and career.

Twin Lakes also offers online programs to support students' independent reading growth. Many classes utilize the 
Accelerated Reader program to motivate students to read books at their independent reading level, and we also of
fer a 
school
-
wide license to Lexia Core 5.
 
 
Art, Music, Physical Education:
 
The staff at Twin Lakes believe that art, music, and physical education are just as important in a child's development as 
reading, writing, and math.  All students in grades kinder
garten through sixth grade participate in specialized programs 
taught by highly qualified teachers.  Student's art work is displayed in the school and in the community.  All children are 
taught appropriate developmental physical skills and the importance o
f nutrition.  All children are taught to sing and 
express themselves through music and take part in class or in grade level performances.  Many staff members have been 
trained in the Education Through Music Program, which was taught by our music teacher an
d other professionals.
 
 
At Twin Lakes, we believe every day is an adventure and together we can help every child develop to his/her full potential.

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
October, 2019
 
 
San Juan Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment
 
pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to 
take home. 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed 
by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption. The table displays i
nformation collected in September 2018 about the quality, currency, and availability of 
the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. If you would like more information 
on the textbooks and instructional materials pl
ease visit our website: http://www.sanjuan.edu/Page/23485 In July 2009, 
EC Section 60200.7. The State Board of Education has adopted frameworks for ELA/ELD, Math, Science and Social 
Sciences, and has identified an approved list of instructional materials a
vailable for adoption. For more information

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Twin Lakes Elementary School is evaluated for ongoing maintenance needs on a yearly assessment. This evaluation 
includes roof repair or replacement, exterior painting, energy
-
efficien
t lighting, heating and cooling system condition, 
doors with handicapped accessible hardware, restroom restoration, electrical infrastructure ability to provide for internet, 
cable, telephone, new fire, intrusion, and intercom systems. Currently, there is 
sufficient space to house the student 
population. There is a site custodial staff that cleans the building along with district support for major/minor repairs. The
 
district provides gardening and landscape services on a regular schedule. Regular fire/emerg
ency drills are held, and 
badges are required for all visitors and personnel. Field repair, and irrigation system retrofit continues to be a concern.  
In 
2005, under Measure J Bond a new gas service was installed to support future heating and air condition
ing upgrades. In 
addition, a low voltage upgrade using Measure J funds was completed in Spring  2014; this included intercoms, fire and 
intrusion alarms.
 
 
The Board of Education and the Superintendent's policy is to ensure that all students are provided with a safe and well
-
maintained learning environment. The board approved resolutions in 1998 and 2002 to adequately fund maintenance 
activities and preserve 
the repairs and improvements funded by two facility bond measures. The school buildings, 
classrooms and grounds are safe, clean and functional. An inspection of the facility was conducted in September 2019 and 
determined that there were no unsafe condition
s that required emergency repairs. District maintenance staff ensures 
that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A 
computer automated work order process is used to ensure efficient servi
ce and that emergency repairs and health and 
safety repairs are given the highest priority. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards and custodial staffing 
requirements for all schools in the district. This school meets the Board's standards f
or custodial staffing and cleanliness. 
The school's custodians are trained in the proper use of cleaning chemicals and Integrated Pest Management techniques. 
They are managed day to day by the Principal with assistance from the district's maintenance depar
tment. The district 
participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, with funding allocated for major repair or replacement 
of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electri
cal 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. Annually the district budgets two million dollars for deferred 
maintenance activities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

a Community Safety Specialist assigned to this school within a geographic zone that includes nearby schools. In addition, 
via a part


school. The Deputy Sherif
fs are assigned to patrol a geographic zone either on the east side of the district or the west side 
of the district. They are assigned specific schools within their assigned zone and respond to this school, or others, as safe

needs dictate. The two CHPD
 
Police Officers are School Resource Officers (SRO) who work identified schools within the 
City of Citrus Heights and respond as safety needs dictate. The two law enforcement agencies will overlap response when 

fficers are dispatched to critical incidents via the Safe Schools Dispatcher, 
a law enforcement dispatcher or via a direct report from a school staff member, school visitor or other person. This school 
has a school safety team which reviews safety matters 
that may affect the campus. Our school safety team meets regularly 
to discuss safety issues, update our site emergency plan, and to take steps to be proactive in preventing various types of 
school
-
related safety issues. Community Safety Specialists and law
 
enforcement provides speakers to address students, 
staff and community groups on matters of school safety. Our safety team receives training, when requested, from Safe 
Schools or law enforcement. This school is responsible for updating our Comprehensive S
chool Safety Plan (CSSP) by March 
1st of every year per the Education Code. As part of the update, this school meets at least once per year with a law 
enforcement officer to review the CSSP, has the local fire department review the CSSP and we hold a commu
nity meeting 
to review the CSSP. The CSSP must be approved by the School Site Council before being submitted to the district safe 

site sp
ecific crisis response procedures and a district standardized emergency flip chart. This school conducts and keeps a 
record of all fire drills, lockdown drills, shelter in place drills and/or earthquake drills up to or in excess of what is re
quired 
by the 
Education Code.

Professional development is a key part of the continuous improvement process for educators. The goal of our quality 
professional development is to support the learning of teachers and paraprofessionals to positively impact student 
achievement.  Annually, t
eachers and site administrators participate in professional development in a variety of 
opportunities.  Seventy
-
five minutes per week are dedicated to staff collaboration and training planned by site leadership 
teams. The District also provides a cycle of 
continuous professional development for Administrators through Principal 
Networks as well as Leadership Academies.
 
 
The District provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators that support the 
implementation of Common Core 
State Standards in English language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and the 
ELA/ELD Framework.  Specific professional development initiatives include: Culturally Responsive Practices, Critical 
Literacy, TK
-
2 Reading, Supporting Independence and
 
Engagement through Reading and Writing, Math to the Core, 
Expository Reading and Writing Course, and ELD Foundations.  District departments, Center for Teacher Support, grant
-

ing opportunities.  Professional 
development opportunities are voluntary for teachers and are provided throughout the year in a variety of formats: during 
the school day, after school, on Saturdays, and during summer and vacation breaks. Many teachers and 
administrators 
also take advantage of opportunities with Sacramento County Office of Education, California Department of Education, 
the college/university programs, state/national education organizations, and private educational institutes.
 
 
What grounds t
he professional development in the district is the District Strategic Plan and the Local Control 
Accountability Plan. Professional Development is further determined using one or more of the following: (a) student 
achievement data, (b) staff survey data, an
d (c) district
-
identified goals.  Professional development addresses the Common 
Core State Standards, teaching strategies, curriculum, assessment, technology, classroom management, safety, and 
leadership. Administrator training accompanies professional dev
elopment in district focus areas, providing 
implementation support for teachers on site.  Content
-
area coaches are available at some schools.  Additional classroom 
support is provided to new and struggling teachers by consulting teachers from the Center fo
r Teacher Support.
