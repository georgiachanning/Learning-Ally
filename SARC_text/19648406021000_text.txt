School Description
 

Unified School District. Nestled in a lovely suburban neighborhood in La Mirada, California, Dulles 
was built in 1960 and still showcases the original brick sidi
ng.
 
 
 
Our school grounds are some of the prettiest in La Mirada with big beautiful trees, a garden full of 
flowers planted by our students, and a well
-
maintained inviting playground.
 
 
Dulles Elementary School is an exceptional place where all children have
 
the opportunity to grow 
socially, emotionally, and academically in a safe and positive learning environment.
 
 
Dulles was honored with the distinctions of California Distinguished School and the Campaign for 
Business and Education Excellence Honor Roll in 
2014 and a Golden Bell Award in 2017. 
 
Because 
of our outstanding student achievement, incredible dedicated teachers and second
-
to
-
none parent 
involvement, Dulles Elementary earned this award signifying that we are one of the best in the 
state. Our school 
was chosen for this honor because of our Signature Practices in Reading and Math 
instruction. All of our teachers, at every grade level, utilize research
-
based Balanced Literacy 
throughout their reading lessons in order to maximize student learning. They i
ncorporate them in 
their reading lessons on a daily basis. With this work being faithfully implemented in every class at 
every level, all Dulles students receive the benefits of this specialized and effective instruction. They 
focus on not only teaching ou
r students how to read but also how to transfer these skills when they 
encounter a difficult text independently.
 
 

rigorous academic setting, our teachers also 
concentrate their efforts to ensure that our students 
are good communicators, are great thinkers, and are respectful of others.
 
 
All staff members are involved in creating a nurturing and challenging learning climate at Dulles 
Elementary.
 
 
Our classrooms a
re print
-
rich environments that create a warm and welcoming place that supports 
student success.
 
 
Our school has established clear performance standards aligned with state content standards and 
sets high
-
level expectations for all students.
 
 
These efforts 
are supported by instructional leadership from our site and district, as well as training 
in research
-
based instructional strategies.
 
 

 
 
During math, our teachers challenge the students to critically think about the processes of each 
concept, using Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), a research
-
based instructional math program. 
With CGI, students not only learn how to solve mathematical p
roblems, they are expected to 
explain their reasoning as they completed the work. As a teacher sees that a group of students are 
struggling with a concept, they will pull that group together for a small group lesson to reinforce 
the concept and address spe
cific issues that the students are experiencing.

earning 
experience.
 
 
All classrooms have a laptop computer, 
document camera, LCD projector and iPads. We also have more than 60 Chromebooks that are 
utilized regularly. 
 
Our students use our computer lab on a daily basis to work on targeted reading and math instruction as well learning 
keyboarding skills. 
 
Our staf
f is dedicated to maintaining a strong commitment to using technology, which has a great connection to 
increasing reading, writing and math scores.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every
 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loc
al educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addi
tionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https:
//www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians an
d 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Onl
y eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

providing enrichment programs and events to promote school spirit and foste
r a positive school climate.  Our students work together with PTA 

grounds. Through the 
generosity of our PTA, Dulles students enjoy
 
a yearlong Meet the Masters art program, field trips, assemblies, and Read Across America events. PTA 
enhances our school community and brings the school, parents and students together with an annual Spring Fling carnival, stud
ent performance 
programs as 
well as a school

assemblies and talent show. Our PTA parents volunteer more than 7,000 hours per year at Dulles! They are truly a vital
 
part of our school community.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth

School Safety Plan
 
Staff monitors the school grounds for 15 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses and at lunchtime. Teacher
s regularly review the rules 
for safe, responsible behavior in school
 
and on the playground. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. During the school day, visitors must enter 
the school through the office door and sign in with the secretary, where they receive a special badge to wear throughout thei
r stay. District e
mployees 
wear a district badge with their picture on it.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emer
gency supplies. We make 
the plan available in the office for parents, and
 
we share the plan with all staff during a school wide staff meeting. We practice fire drills ten times a year 
and earthquake and lockdown drills three times a year. Trainings for staff on emergency preparedness take place at the beginn
ing of the year and 
throughout the year as needed.
