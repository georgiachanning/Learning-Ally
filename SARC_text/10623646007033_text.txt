School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

education is a responsibility shared by the school, family, and community
. In order to educate and support our students 
effectively, the school, parents, and community work very hard together as committed partners. Our parents participate 
regularly in our school activities and support and nurture our goal of student achievement
 
and belonging. Finally, our 
school has a strong base of parent volunteers who participate in a variety of ways including: working with their children 
at home, volunteering in the classrooms, as chaperones for special events and field trips,  running our M
JB Cougar store 
and many other specific activities that enhance a positive school culture.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student and staff safety is our primary concern at Mathew J. Brletic School.  The MJB Safety Committee is in the process 
of reviewing  and updating to staff for input and approval, the Mathew J. Brletic Safety Plan.   Brletic School focuses on 
compliance w
ith all rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school 
conducts monthly fire drills throughout the school year.  Lockdown drills are also conducted once a quarter.  Students are 
supervised before, during,
 
and after school by certificated and classified staff and administration.  School visitors must 
report to the school administration office.  All visitors wishing to visit the campus must follow board policy of making prio
r 
arrangements with school adminis
tration before their visit and must sign in and out in the administration office.  Upon 
signing in, visitors are welcomed and given a visitor's pass, which must be worn at all times while on campus.  Parents 
wishing to volunteer in their child's classroom 
must complete the Parlier Unified School District Volunteer application.  
Once the application is submitted, the district will schedule fingerprinting appointments for parents.  Upon clearance, 
parents and school personnel will be notified and parents will
 
be issued a school volunteer name badge. Last  Fall the 
district conducted its Second training on "Knowledge Saves Lives"  at the MJB site. The mandatory training took 4 hours 
and included all certificated and classified staff members. The training was us
ed to simulated multiple threats, active 
shooter and other basic protection for students against a viable threat involving weapons.
