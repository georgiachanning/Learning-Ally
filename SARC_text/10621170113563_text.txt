The Bud Rank Ravens have established a record of excellence since we first opened our doors in 
2007. We welcomed many new faces to the Raven family with student
-
body enrollment at 840 
students for the 2018
-
2019 school year. The Bud Rank Ravens continued ou
r tradition of excellence 
with another Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) Clovis Assessment System for Sustained 
Improvement (CLASSI) Exemplary School Award. We know that the success of Bud Rank Elementary 
School (BRES) is a tribute to the hard work and
 
dedication of the community, students, and staff. 
Our theme for the 2018
-
2019 school year was Be Raven, Be Kind. It was carried out throughout the 
year in rallies, morning announcements, the school Raven Run, and Parent Teacher Club (PTC) spirit 
wear. We 
will continue our efforts to meet district and state standards and work with the school 
community to gather feedback and implement changes so our students excel in mind, body and 
spirit.
 
 
Bud Rank Elementary students and staff are enthusiastic about 
being the best we can be to reach 
our goals. The Ravens earned superior performances in music and pep and cheer. We had huge 
participation in the Winter Holiday Program and fall play, as well as art and essay contests. Students 
show pride and character on 
athletic teams throughout the year. I congratulate our students and 
staff for their commitment to represent
-
ing Bud Rank.
 
 
School goals for the 2019
-
2020 school year include the following:
 

 
Bud Rank will be recognized for exemplary achievement based on the 
results of the 
Clovis Assessment System for Sustained Improvement (CLASSI).
 

 

student will continually improve in language arts, mathematics, science, social science, 
physica
l education, and the arts by scoring higher than previous years on state standards 
as measured by district assessments.
 

 
The Bud Rank staff will transition to the California Common Core State Standards and 
Assessments and use district benchmarks to guide in
struction.
 

 
The Bud Rank staff will provide a positive learning and work environment for students 
and staff by promoting character development and education throughout the core 
curriculum and ensuring safety.
 

 
Bud Rank will operate with increased efficiency 
and effectiveness to optimize the use of 
resources to accomplish school goals and increase the student attendance rate.
 

 
Bud Rank will operate in a collaborative system that develops a Professional Learning 
Community and data teams to reach our goals.
 
 
We w
ill continue our efforts to meet district and state standards and work toward creating a school 
community that supports student learning and developing our students in mind, body, and spirit.
 
 
Sincerely,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Built in 2007, Bud Rank Elementary is thirteen years old. The beautifully 
designed campus contains 32 classrooms; a multi
-
purpose room, which includes 
a kitchen, staff lunchroom, a music room, and office; four portables for Campus Club; and storage areas on the stage. Full at
hletic fields to accommodate 
a football field and trac
k, soccer and three baseball/softball fields are located on campus. A blacktop area with six full basketball courts and two p
lay 
structures is also located on campus. Additionally, the library media center and computer lab are located adjacent to the adm
in
istration building. As we 

eds of the enrollment.
 
 
Our campus clearly shows the pride that the staff, students, and parents have in 
our school. We provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our custodial 
staff is on campus each school day from morning to late at night. A full
-
time plant supervisor along with a full
-
time and a part
-
time night custodian 
perform basic cleaning operations
 
daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, deep clean
-
ing is conducted two times a year at the site. 
Our SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms 
on a 

-
campus inspection last year. Additionally, twice 
a year the PTC organizes a campus
-
beautification day on Saturday where students, parents and sta
ff work to replace old landscaping with new shrubs 
and colorful annuals. These efforts have really enhanced the beauty of our campus.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

ate our school safety 
plan with input from staff, students, parent
s, and community members. Most recently, the school safety plan was updated in October 2018 after receiving 
training from the Clovis Police Department. The staff reviews the plan each August during staff meetings before school starts
. Teachers are assigned
 
to 
supervise the school grounds before school, during recess, and after school. Four campus monitors assist the administration i
n supervising students 
during the lunch hour. A Parent Club
-
supported volunteer program in its tenth year called the Raven RAD 
(Really Awesome Dad) program provided 
additional supervision during recess. These dads wear orange safety vests and participate in morning and lunch recess, adding
 
another adult to help 
supervise on the playground.
 
 
Key elements of the safety plan include 
monthly safety drills and crisis
-
intervention plans. An emergency folder, which includes important safety 
guidelines, has been assembled for each classroom and facility on campus. Monthly safety drills ensure students and staff pra
ctice these guidelines in
 
a 
variety of situations. Staff and student representatives report after each monthly drill and slight changes may be made to th
e safety procedures. As we 
add more students each year, the drills provide important feedback to make evacuations and student ac
counting efforts smooth and quick.
 
 
Each semester an assembly is held for each grade level to review behavior expectations and instill pride in doing their best 
and following the pillars of 
character. In addition, Bully
-
Proofing Your School curriculum was 
presented at each grade level as a preventative measure in developing a positive school 
climate. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, Bud Rank used the Second Step program in grades K
-
6 for the tenth year, adding another layer of student 
education in getting alo
ng with others and other bully
-
prevention strategies. Bud Rank Elementary, as part of the Clovis North Area (CNA), gives each 
parent a CNA Student
-
Parent Handbook and District Student Rights and Responsibilities, which outlines behavior guidelines and cons
equences including 
suspensions and expulsions.

CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may receive, district or school parent councils and committees are require
d under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such advisory 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)
 

 
District Learner Advisory

ssary and vital part of 
devel


Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP).  If you would like additional information on any of the District P

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent 
committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is resp
onsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the 
SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district
 
and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Ed
ucation Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T
he ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel.
 
The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding services for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there ar
e 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra
nge to have that 
representative attend every DELAC 
meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) e
lected to serve as th
e DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other nee
ds related to the student achievement of our students, community agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades
 
K 
-

assists eligible students to ach
ieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades pre

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP annually that works to better align the academic plan
 
with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  L
CAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools.
 


 
 

t youth and families and to 
provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The foll
owing is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined in each
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

ulum program.  Some children have special characteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack 
English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our 
c
hildren are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Categor
ical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.

Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students 
with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (
base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increa
se the ability of teachers and other staff to challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
