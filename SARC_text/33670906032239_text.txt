Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an 
evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of classroom teachers in the appropriate disciplin
e (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the curriculum frameworks, the State Board of Edu
cation
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted textbooks were selected from the state
-
approve
d list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science and history/social science; 
forei
gn language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enrollment.  Middle school and high school 
studen
ts receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enr
ollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of our school facilities are a high priority for the District. Overall, school grounds and 
facilities are in good repair. School grounds are maintained by a full
-
time day custodian and a full
-
time night custodian. 
The Dist
rict's Deferred Maintenance Plan is assessed and updated every year. Work generated by the Deferred 
Maintenance Plan is generally completed during the summer months. Fire inspections are conducted on an annual basis 
and any issues are addressed immediately
. The District also has an internal inspection team conducting annual safety 
inspections of all sites. All safety
-
related items are handled as a top priority.
 
 
Van Buren was built in 1958 and sits on an 8
-
acre lot. Presently, the Van Buren campus is compri
sed of 18 classrooms, 11 
portable classrooms, one library and a multipurpose room that serves as the school cafeteria. Van Buren students have 
access to a large playground made up of blacktop with basketball, volleyball, handball, and tetherball courts, as
 
well as 
park

Recent improvements were made to our school site.  A gate was installed in our kindergarten playground in o
rder to 
provide our kindergarten students direct access to the playground.  In addition, panels have been installed on our fence 
in our kindergarten playground.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
