About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required
 
to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be
 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more inf
ormation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the scho
ol principal or the 
district office.

periodically to maintain an attractive appearance. The custodial/grounds staff of two maintains clean and safe facilities tha
t were built in 1995. The 
custodial staff is supported by the Castro Valley School District Maintenance Department whe
n repairs or replacement of equipment is needed. In 2016, 
voters approved Measure G which will bring many improvements to the campus.
 
 
Students have both a large grassy field area in which to play field sports and an asphalt area where they can play basket

equipment designed to build upper and lower body strength in stud
ents. Kindergarten students have a separate play structure and asphalt play area that 
is appropriate for kindergarten age students. District maintenance staff ensures that necessary repairs are completed in a ti

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the 
University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district make
s to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents, guardians and the community are very supportive of the educational programs at Jensen Ranch Eleme
ntary. The Parent
-
Teacher Association 
(PTA) plays an active role in the community and the school through fundraising and special activities. Family members are enc
ouraged to volunteer to 
help coordinate PTA community
-
building events such as our Back to Sch
ool Potluck, Halloween carnival, movie nights, Science Night, Battle of the Books, 
the Walk
-
a
-
thon, and our family nights. During August registration, families are given the opportunity to sign up to help in all activit
ies needing volunteers. 
Bi
-
monthly ev
ening PTA meetings are open to all parents.
 
 
Parents and guardians play an active role in supporting field trips and volunteering in the classroom. They drive students to
 
the field trip destination and 
act as chaperones during the instructional portion of 
the trip. As a classroom volunteer, parents may support a teacher by assisting individual or small 
groups of students with their learning. Parents and guardians are also integral to the success of the Jensen Arts and Music (
JAM) Program and our music 
progr
am. Through these programs, our volunteers act as docents, providing lessons for classes about famous composers and artists. 
Finally, our 
volunteers assist in our library and help support the technology within each classroom and in the computer lab.
 
 
Famil
ies who enjoy knowing more about the curricular aspects of the school are encouraged to attend and/or be a voting member of t
he School Site 
Council to examine school improvement opportunities.  Our EL families are encouraged to participate in our site ELAC
 
and district DELAC meetings.  
Parents are also involved in district level committees to provide school site representation.
 
 
Parents or community members who wish to participate in site leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or volun
teer 
on campus may 
contact the school directly.
 
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed annually by our School Site Council.  This group is comprised of the principal, parents, a
nd teachers. In the winter of 
each year the plan is reviewed and revi
sions are made as appropriate.  Portions of the plan are also updated in the Fall of each year to include the names 
of new staff members and responsibilities. A key element of the Safety Plan is updating and replenishing emergency preparedne
ss kits and mat
erials. 
Emergency drills are held on a monthly basis; a combination of fire drills, earthquake drills, shelter in place drills, secur
e campus drills, and off campus 
evacuation drills are conducted. The Safety Plan also includes a description of how we main
tain a respectful, bully
-
free environment for all students. All 
of our students model the "Jaguar PAW Pledge," which defines our behavior expectations in each area of our school. Our "PAW P
ledge" expectations are 
posted and visible throughout the campus.
 
 
An emphasis is placed on campus safety and security. Teachers supervise students on campus before and after school, and durin
g recess. Noon duty 
supervisors monitor students during lunchtime. All visitors must sign in at the school's office and receive pro
per authorization to be at the school. Visitors 
are expected to display their visitor pass at all times. Volunteers are cleared through Megan's Law process. Our campus is ga
ted and is equipped with 
security cameras. During the school day, only one monitore
d gate is accessible to visitors, maximizing safety for our children.  All staff participate in the 
ALICE safe schools training.

Each school year there are two district

or workshops that are aligned with site goals.  
Our staff of highly
-
qualified teachers often provide trainings for one another on topics such as technology 
integration, reading intervention instruction, and behavior support strategies.  Teachers attend cross
-
site grade level trainings during the school 
year to 
collaborate with other schools in the district.  Professional development supports MTSS, Common Core essential standards, PBI
S, social
-
emotional/behavioral needs and grade
-
level meetings with subject area Teachers on Special Assignment.  Jensen Ran
ch teachers also participate in GLAD 
and SVMI trainings.  Our staff utilize a wide variety of data to make instructional and behavioral decisions to support our s
tudents in their learning.
