School Description
 
Our Vision: All Students Will Achieve At High Levels
 
 
Where academic improvements are needed, the Pacific Staff and School Site Council have spent 
time analyzing and monitoring achievement data in order to make instructional adjustments for 
improving student outcomes. The following items reflect major compone
nts of the plan for 
improving academic achievement at Pacific School:
 
Teachers collaborate in grade level or school
-
wide teams at least 1 time per week after school.
 
Grade level teams have participated in 2
-
3 ELA Coaching Cycles  with district training spe
cialists.  
Also, Grade level teams regularly met with district ELA/ELD training specialists during grade level 
CT.
 
All students are eligible to receive Supplemental Educational Services (tutoring) and all students 
have access to grade level computer interv
ention (iReady & ST Math).

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pu
blish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepa
re a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consiste
nt with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information 
about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluation committee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other s
taff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community,
 
ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's adopted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, student

Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evalu
ation committee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. In some instances, the c
onsidered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being r
ecommended for adoption to the Board of Education.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
