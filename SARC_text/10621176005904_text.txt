Message
 
 
This School Accountability Report Card (SARC) is issued annually by local school boards 
for each 
elementary and secondary school in the state. It provides parents and other interested people a 
variety of information about the school, its resources
, successes and the areas in which 
improvements are needed. It is important to note that this doc
ument represents the 2018
-
19 
school year and not the current school year. I believe in this report you will find a school that strives 
to maximize student achi
evement, a faculty that is professional and personally committed to 
meeting the learning needs of
 
all students, along with a student body that is motivated to be the 
best it can be. Our staff continues to practice as Professional Learning Communities to as
sist their 
own professional development utilizing the California Common Core State Standards and 
the use 
of researched
-

level 
concepts.
 
 
Sierra Vista Elementary is a California Gold Ribbon School, and a California State University, Fresno 
Bonner Center for Character Education Award
 
winning school, and is hte reciepient of the CLASSI 
Accountablity Award (2019) through Clovis Unified. These f
irst two awards are a four year 
designation, whereas the CLASSI award must be earned each year. 
 
 
We at Sierra Vista Elementary and in the Clovis
 
Unified School District provide many opportunities 
for parents to become active, involved and informed partner
s in the education of their children. 
This SARC is but one component in that process, created to help you learn more about Sierra Vista. 
The SARC
, along with our newly revised 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and other documents,

About the SARC
 
By Fe
bruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contai
ns information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fu
nding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describe
s how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
stat
e and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about S
ARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facili
ty Conditions and Planned Improvements (M
ost Recent Year)
 
Sierra Vista is 65 years old. It was originally built in 1953, and during the spring and summer of 2014, the site facility un
derwent planned modernization 
projects funded by the Measure A bond. The 
modernization projects were fully complet
ed in January 2015. Our library and kitchen were completely 
remodeled. A computer technology lab was built, providing up
-
to
 
date technology usage for our staff and students. Electrical wiring, light fixtures and 
our 
restrooms were also updated. Our classro
oms received new ventilator units, providing more efficient air flow
 
for our air
-
conditioning and heating 
purposes. On June 25, 2014, our multipurpose room (MPR) was heavily damaged due to a construction fire. The rec
onstruction of our MPR was completed 
in
 
March 2015, with a new stage, theater lighting and sound system. In 2016, we added a staff lounge to our existing multipurpos
e room. We added solar 
panels in September 2016 to support our energy savings efforts. Duri
ng the summer of 2018, new
 
carpet was i
nstalled in all buildings and classrooms.
 
 
We consistently provide a clean, safe learning environment. Our custodians perform basic cleaning operations daily and mainta
in the grounds and 
buildings. In 
addition, deep cleaning is conducted two times a year o
n our site. Our SARTcommittee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections during the 
year. This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feedback to our 
student body. Our campus 
inspection team regularly rank

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priori
ty: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information re
levant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
ed
ucation population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased 
and proud
 
to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending on the type of categorica
l

School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) describes t
he 

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every student.  Parental involvement is a nece
ssary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our 
ove

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP).  If you would like additional information on any of the District Parent Councils or Commi
ttees, 
ple

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with ca
teg
orical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
ts, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implem
ent
ing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serve
s a
s an advisory committee 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education 
pro
grams are supplemental education opportunities that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  The SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to
 
fu
nction as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are required to form an ELAC. T
he ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes 
rec
ommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding services for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two years.

District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the dist
ric
t, there shall be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a DELAC representative and arra
nge to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws
 
re
quire each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/guardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) e
lected to serve as the DELAC 

 
EL
AC.
 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meets four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement
 
of
 
our students, community agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native students in grades
 
K

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP annually that works to better align the academic plan
 
with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our 
CUSD
 
Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participation of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, D
istrict Meetings and 
Communi
ty F
orums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share their ideas
 
on how CUSD 
can provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in 
the 


 
 

uth and families and to 
provide input
 
and
 
feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to share new ideas to su
pport 
identified groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical f
undi

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 

 
cha
racteristics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economically disadvantaged ho
mes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they
 
hav
e a primary language other than English.  Children, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally provided through the base/core curriculum program.
  
The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental s
ervi
ces and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Categorical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support to meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of hig
h qu
ality learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any le
arni
ng gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff deve
lopment 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other sta
ff t
o challenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
