School Description
 
Welcome to Fletcher Hills Elementary School! Our staff and community work together closely to 
provide each child with the 
positive and supportive academic experience they need to reach their 
full potential. We are passionate about teaching and learning. Our dedication to thoughtful 
teaching and powerful learning guides us as we prepare our students to become confident, 
concer
ned, productive citizens.
 
 
We are committed to providing our students with a challenging and enriching education that assists 
each child in developing the skills necessary to read well, think clearly, communicate effectively, 
compute accurately, value and 
appreciate diversity, and work to find creative solutions to complex 
challenges. Our comprehensive academic program is designed to meet diverse instructional needs, 
and is closely monitored by grade
-
level Professional Learning Communities/Data Teams. Throu
gh 
this process, all teachers take responsibility for the academic, emotional, and social well
-
being of 

students are provided with what each individual needs to m
ake progress on essential core 
academic standards. Students who need to be challenged are provided that opportunity while 
students who require reteaching and additional instruction on concepts are provided that 
opportunity. Teachers work with their colleag
ues in Professional Learning Communities to analyze 

Teachers meet weekly to examine data and come together with the Principal and support staff 
every 6
-
8 weeks to
 
examine student achievement toward mastery of essential standards and to 
plan for enrichment and interventions in the coming weeks.
 
 
In addition, programs like PeaceBuilders support our students in developing the intrinsic values that 
allow them to be 
caring citizens and increase their abilities to solve interpersonal problems 
peacefully. Each month there is a school
-
wide focus on a different character trait.  Each week a 
different class shares a connection to the character trait through a song, sharing
 
facts, reading a 
poem etc. A variety of after
-
school enrichment classes provide additional opportunities for 
students to advance their skills and develop their interests. Through a strong comprehensive 
instructional program, the inclusion and support of o
ur community, and our commitment to every 
child learning every day, students are met with success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains info
rmation about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how t
hey intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC req
uirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Fletcher Hills welcomes and values parental in
volvement. It takes a team to support all of our students, and parents are a crucial part of that team. We 
have documented over thousands of hours of volunteer time this past year. Along with direct contact with children by voluntee
ring in the classroom, 
p
arents are encouraged to serve on various site and district committees. Additionally, we invite parents who would like to vol
unteer to become involved 
in other programs such as: Art Docent Program 

 
Volunteers using district art prints and curriculum provi
de fine arts instruction to classroom groups of 
students, Everyone A Reader 

 
Trained volunteer tutors are matched with struggling readers in the first, second, and third grades to improve fluency and 
comprehension, Everyone a Reader volunteers work one
-
on
-
one with students using research
-
informed instructional methods to help the children reach 
their grade
-
level in reading. Volunteers work with their students approximately one hour per week for at least six months, and MORE!  If 
you are 
interested in volun
teering with students and you aren't sure how, talk to your child's teacher, there are many opportunities.
 
 
English Language Acquisition Committee 

 
ELAC is a group of parents of students who are English learners. This group meets four times each year to 
r
eceive information on special programs and services and to understand how instruction is provided to students who are learnin
g English.
 
 
Parent Volunteering Opportunities 

 
Parents of our community serve as volunteers in the classrooms, on field trips, and
 
throughout our school programs 
and activities.
 
 
PTA 

 

onthly and provides 
support for school programs and activities, including as
semblies, fundraisers, Family Nights, book fairs, and evening activities.

Professional learning in La Mesa
-
Spring Valley continues evolving to cultivate capacity and efficacy of teachers so that they can ensure high levels of 
learning for each and every student. In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a c
ommon language around high quality teaching 
and learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional l
earning communities. This 
work has included a deeper dive into content standards throug
h the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective 
assessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on align
ing instruction to 
standards and student experi
ence, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.
 
 
New for the 2019
-
20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while
 
still 
offering face
-
to
-
face p
rofessional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi
-
year seminars where 
teachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards
-
based
 
instruction, Mindful 
Math where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District ma
th curriculum more 
accessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can u
se to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional 
development continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education,
 
NGSS and effective 
integration of technology into instruction.
 
 
With
 
professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that
 
it is relevant, 
timely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to 
analyze student data and discuss best 
practices to address the needs of each and every student.
 
 
The district offers workshops and multiple
-
day seminars, after
-
school workshops, online courses, and one
-
on
-
one coaching and modeling. Select teachers 
also att
end conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing profe
ssional development 
at site learning days and staff meetings.
