About
 
the
 
SARC
 
By
 
February
 
1
 
of
 
each
 
year,
 
every
 
school
 
in
 
California
 
is
 
required
 
by
 
state
 
law
 
to
 
publish
 
a
 
School
 
Accountability
 
Report
 
Card
 
(SARC).
 
The
 
SARC
 
contains
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
condition
 
and
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
California
 
public
 
school.
 
Under
 
the
 
Local
 
Control
 
Funding
 
Formula
 
(LCFF)
 
all
 
local
 
educational
 
agencies
 
(LEAs)
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
prepare
 
a
 
Local
 
Control
 
and
 
Accountability
 
Plan
 
(LCAP),
 
which
 
describes
 
how
 
they
 
intend
 
to
 
meet
 
annual
 
school-specific
 
goals
 
for
 
all
 
pupils,
 
with
 
specific
 
activities
 
to
 
address
 
state
 
and
 
local
 
priorities.
 
Additionally,
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
an
 
LCAP
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
consistent
 
with
 
data
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
SARC.

Hill
 
Elementary
 
has
 
been
 
updated
 
technologically
 
and
 
has
 
Internet
 
connectivity
 
in
 
each
 
classroom.
 
Our
 
cafeteria/multipurpose
 
room
 
serves
 
as
 
many
 
as
 
500
 
hot
 
lunches
 
daily
 
and
 
doubles
 
as
 
our
 
assembly
 
room.
 
We
 
allocate
 
one
 
building
 
to
 
the
 
school™s
 
on-
site
 
daycare
 
program
 
to
 
serve
 
our
 
families
 
before
 
and
 
after
 
school
 
and
 
one
 
to
 
a
 
state-run
 
preschool.
 
 
The
 
physical
 
quality
 
of
 
our
 
school
 
buildings
 
influences
 
learning
 
and
 
teaching.
 
All
 
students
 
and
 
faculty
 
have
 
a
 
reasonable
 
amount
 
of
 
classroom
 
and
 
open
 
space.

The
 
district
 
governing
 
board
 
has
 
adopted
 
cleaning
 
standards
 
for
 
all
 
schools
 
in
 
the
 
district.
 
A

of
 
these
 
standards
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school
 
office
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
district
 
office.
 
The
 
principal
 
works
 
daily
 
with
 
the
 
custodial
 
staff
 
to
 
develop
 
cleaning
 
schedules
 
to
 
ensure
 
a
 
clean
