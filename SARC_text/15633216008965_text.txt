By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Accountability Report Card was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 1988. 
As you read the Report Card yo
u will gain a better understanding of Harding as a school with a record for improvement, a 
faculty that is professionally skilled and personally committed to meeting the learning needs of students, and a student 
body which is enthusiastic and motivated to 
perform well.  Harding School, built in 1959, is situated in the northeast part 
of the city. The school was named for Ruth Clarke Harding to honor her many years of dedicated service in the District, 
both as a teacher and as a principal.
 
 
Harding Elementary
 
School's mission is to ensure a success oriented, safe, positive environment that utilizes research 
based instructional strategies; where academic decisions are based on current data, parent involvement is considered an 
essential part of student achieveme
nt, and all individuals have respect for others and the world in which they live.
 
 
At Harding, we believe in educating the whole child.  In addition to strong core subject instruction, students are engaged 
in extra
-
curricular activities such as oral languag
e competition, math bowl, science fair, track team, orchestra and glee 
club, student council and more.  Regular common formative assessments are created and administered by our teaching 
staff to monitor academic progress and plan for future instruction.  O
ur positive behavior system recognizes students 
whose behavior meets our expressed expectations.  Students earn "Charger Checks" for positive actions which can be 
redeemed for prizes.  Students whose behavior interferes with their academics are supported w
ith interventions put in 
place by our Behavior Intervention Specialist and carried out by all staff members.   Our school
-
wide writing program 
builds from Kindergarten through Sixth Grade.  Students become proficient at narrative, informational, and opinio
n writing 
as guided by the Common Core State Standards.  The Community Readers Project, under the supervision of our reading 
teacher tutor, provides individual instruction for struggling reading students who then typically show more than one year's 
growth 
in Reading Language Arts after participating in the project.  A strong Parent Club supports our school goals by 
providing funding for class projects and curriculum related field trips.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:
 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cali
fornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alterna
te achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training opportunities affirm the basic philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong 
process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruction and student learning.
 
 
All training revolves around identified needs of student
s and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, the Common Core 
State Standards, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional ma
terials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning Communities through our Service Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is prov
ided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and resources for collaboration, 
planning, and professional development. Additionally, we p
rovided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.
 
 
Teachers new to the District received four days of professional development prior to the beginning of the school year 
focused on orientation to D
istrict and school site policies and services, Common Core State Standards, classroom 
management, curriculum and pacing, using technology and setting up the classroom. Teachers in their second year with 
the District received two days of professional develo
pment prior to the beginning of the school year provided by the school 
site and focused on improving best practices.
 
 
New teachers with California preliminary credentials received professional development through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD)
 
Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California Induction 
standards. The culmination of TIP is the recomm
endation for the CA Clear Credential. Each TIP teacher was assigned a 
veteran teacher who served as a mentor. The mentors received on
-
going professional development in 
coaching/mentoring strategies, instructional strategies, and guiding cycles of inquiry. 
Professional development was 
provided through individual mentoring, monthly meetings, and after
-
school workshops.
 
 
Intern teachers received professional development at monthly meetings focusing on the initial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom
 
management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day
-
to
-
day support in these areas as well as advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. M
entors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern Program.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs)
 
were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Credential. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD
 
staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provided a weekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
T
wo cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners to ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisit
e requirements to move to credentials.
