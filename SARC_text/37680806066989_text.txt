Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Capri Elementary School has served the community of Leucadia in north coastal San Diego County since opening in 1969.  
Our families describe our K
-

 
a California 
Distinguished School.
 
 

apri 
has developed an exemplary Dual Language Immersion program in Spanish, which serves stude
nts from throughout the 
district. The Dual Language Immersion Program is a challenging and rigorous academic program in which Spanish is used 
as the primary language of instruction. The program implements a 90/10
-
immersion model in which K
-
1 students recei
ve 
90% of their instruction in Spanish and 10% in English. Each year after first grade, the percentage of time instructed in 
English in core subjects increases by 10% annually, until 4th 
-
6th grade, which is 50/50.  The goals of the program are: 
academic e
xcellence, fluency and literacy in both languages, and cross
-
cultural understanding.
 
 

neighborhood, Capri also enriches academic learning
 
by infusing visual and performing arts throughout our school
-
wide 
program.  Capri parents actively support and enhance student learning through generous volunteerism.
 
 
Thanks to our PTA and Encinitas Education Foundation, we engage music, science, art, an
d PE consultants who further 


-
working.  Together, we share our b
eautiful 
campus, pursuing our vision of exceptional learning for every child.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Capri Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for all students, staff and volunteers. The school facilities 
were built in 1969 and currently include the library, multi
-
purpose room, staff 
lounge, science lab, twenty two permanent 
classrooms, seven portable classrooms, and two playgrounds. Improvements made in 2018
-
19: Replaced worn ramps to 
portables, new flooring throughout the entire campus, and the Capri garden area underwent a complete 
revitalization as 
a part of our Green Team work.  In 2018, the library was beautified with paint and new flexible seating and is now known 
as Capri Commons. We also built two. new ball walls on the playground.
 
 
District maintenance supervisors are proactiv
e and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority. District maintenance has 
indicated that 100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]

through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is essential to learning. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) is 
developed by Capri Elementary in consultation with local law enforcement/Emergency Preparedness staff, School Site 
Council (SSC) and Adminis
trative Services in order to comply with Senate Bill 187. It was most recently updated and 
reviewed in September 2019 and accepted by the Board of Trustees in November 2019.
 
 
The CSSP includes elements such as emergency plans and procedures, including the 
Run, Hide, Fight Model, the School 
Protection Evacuation Plan for Wildfire, school rules and school dress codes. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake 
drills are held four times a year, and two lockdown exercise drills are practiced each year. All 
schools in the district are 
closed campuses, and visitors must immediately register in the school office before entering the campus. School access is 
monitored by administrators, teachers and other school staff.
