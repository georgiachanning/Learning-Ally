School Description
 
Fred H. Rohr School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including 
charters. Rohr School was built in 1965. During the summer of 2004 the entire school underwent a 
complete remodel. The school is situated in a park
-
like setti
ng. The buildings consist of three 
instructional pods of six classrooms each, a kindergarten wing of two classrooms, two portable 
classrooms and an administration wing that includes an auditorium/cafeteria and library. With the 
District's support of Local 
Control Accountability Plan funds, the school has weekly visual and 
performing arts instruction for the students in the areas of visual art, music, and physical education. 
This year 3rd
-
6th grade students are able to participate in a string orchestra progr
am in partnership 
with the San Diego Symphony as a VH1 Save the Music grant. Integrated technology in the content 
areas is taught to K
-
6th grades students in the classroom; additionally the school is utilizing 
Accelerated Reader, Achieve 3000, and Imagine 
Learning  computer programs. Furthermore, Rohr 
has added Prodigy Math, a digital resource to support math instruction.
 
 
Rohr has embarked on a three year
 
Professional Learning Cycle focused on creating a balanced 
literacy program in all classrooms.  The learning cycles are centered on interactive read
-
aloud, 
shared reading, and guided reading. Next year, the integration of writing within and across the 
cur
riculum will be a focus for school
-
wide learning.   The professional learning cycle will deepen the 
understanding of reading and writing instruction to positively impact our school community.
 
 
During the fall of 2018, Rohr staff initiated a process to revi
ew and rewrite the schools Vision and 
Mission Statements.
 
 
Vision
 
The Rohr Community is committed to creating a challenging and nurturing environment where all 
students are valued, loved, and respected.  Through the cooperative efforts of staff, students 
e
volve into innovative thinkers, socially responsible citizens and lifelong learners who positively 
influence the world around them.
 
 
Mission
 
Each day the Rohr Community will provide a safe and nurturing learning community for each 
individual child to grow 
and flourish.  All educators will model, instruct, and provide rigorous 
instruction to all students in all content areas.
 
 
The teachers and staff have developed the "ROAR" values of being respectful, owning choices, 
always being safe, and being responsibil
ity. These are the building blocks toward student success 
and life
-
long learning. These basic values and beliefs are the foundation upon which we build our 
daily instruction and for our students to be successful in life. In keeping with the Chula Vista 
Ele
mentary School District's core value, Rohr staff believes all students are unique, special, and 
individuals of great worth!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC).
 
The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP)
, which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more inf
ormation about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

During our PTA meeting on September 5, 2019 there was time for parents and staff to provide input on safety concerns around c
ampus. A short survey 
was completed by all members who attended the meeting.  The community was invited to the meeting via a school
 
messenger phone call on September 
4, 2019 , the information was posted on our school blog for the two weeks prior to the event, flyers were sent home during th
e week of August 26, 2019, 
and the meeting was noted on the school marquee from September 2
-
Sept
ember 5, 2019. All communication was provided in both English and Spanish 
to ensure the appropriate avenues were utilized to reach the community. In addition, the plan was reviewed at the School Site
 
Council Meeting on 
September 11, 2019.
 
 
The SSC approved
 
the Safety and Site Emergency Plans on September 2019. Student safety and well being are promoted by the following activities
 
which 
include and are not limited to: emergency, fire, and evacuation drills, drug and alcohol prevention programs, and child abu
se awareness programs for 
students and parents. Playground supervision by both certified and classified staff, and continued utilization of the Safety 
Patrol to monitor students' 
movement across busy intersections, play a key role in maintaining discipline
 
and safety on campus.  The school
-
wide "ROARing" expectations are the 
guiding principles to support student behavior. The school psychologist and social worker conduct weekly social growth groups
 
for recommended 
students and a SDSU intern provides additio
nal sessions under their supervision. The principal conducts classroom visits, and holds assemblies for all 
students. Student expectations are reviewed quarterly by teachers and students are honored who demonstrate exemplary behavior
 
to their peers and 
oth
ers.  Students who have made progress in academics and citizenship are recognized at the quarterly assembly.
