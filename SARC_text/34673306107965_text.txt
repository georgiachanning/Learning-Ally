By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Utilizing Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS): an approach for teaching children appropriate 
behavior and providing the supports necessary to susta
in that behavior;
 

 
Encouraging parents and community partners to be involved through our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) , 
School Site Council, and classroom/site volunteer program.
 
School & Community Profile:
 
Oak Chan Elementary School, which opened in t
he fall of 1989, is located in the Lexington Hills subdivision of Folsom and 
serves students residing in Lexington Hills, the Parkway development, and the Pinnacle, the Falls, Legends and Fairmont 
Apartments. Our completely rebuilt campus includes 4 new bu
ildings; 21 classrooms with 2 additional rooms. In support 
of our Full Inclusion Program as well as other physical movement, one classroom has dedicated space for our school 
Occupational Therapist. The Learning Center and Academic Support classrooms are lo
cated in our Resource Center. This 
spacious facility includes offices for our Speech Pathologist and School Psychologist as well as a fully supported library an
d 
Science Technology Engineering Art and Math (STEAM) Lab. All new furniture allows for flexible
 
seating and state of the 

and playground areas, students have an opportunity to explore, be creative, and experience all the elements of 
outdoor 
play. We are very fortunate to have a small park across the street from our school, with wetlands and a second park within 
walking distance. A small pond and bike trail are adjacent to our school grounds and provide an ideal learning environment 
fo
r nature studies. 
 
 
During the first month of the 2019
-
2020 school year, 476 students were enrolled in grades kindergarten through fifth. The 
school's gender distribution is roughly equal. The largest ethnic group is White, with 67.5% of the school populat
ion 
describing themselves as White. In terms of racial subgroups, significant numbers include Hispanic at 11.9% and Asian at 
9.8%. Oak Chan Elementary School has approximately 61 students who receive Special Education Services and 3.9% of the

The faculty and staff at Oak Chan believe that our children's education is a responsibility shared by our school, our 
students, our families and our community. Our primary goal is to prepare students to become responsible citizens and 
pr
oductive, caring members of our society. Oak Chan students are provided with an environment that is safe, caring, 
friendly and educationally inspiring. High academic expectations and mastery of the basic skills are emphasized, with 
students pursuing good s
tudy skills and a development of an appreciation for lifelong learning. Our dedicated staff of 
professionals and paraprofessionals is passionate about their chosen profession and strive to provide a model learning 
environment for ALL children. In 2014 our 
school was named a Distinguished School based on our high standards, 
academic student support, and positive learning community. While it has been several years since Oak Chan was awarded 
this title, our staff has not deviated from a vision that continues t
o strive for excellence in all areas of educating the whole 
child. 
 
 
Our school wide discipline program is based on Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS); clearly defined 
standards for student behavior, consistent and fairly enforced conseque
nces, and appropriate incentives/recognition. The 
Second Step Character Program is utilized to address positive choices and anti
-
bullying. Our school is a safe, healthy 
learning environment based on a belief that students learn to advocate for themselves a
nd problem solve in a respectful 
manner; being reflective and accountable for their choices assures students a successful school experience. Parents and 
public are encouraged to be involved with the school program through our PTO (Parent Teacher Organizati
on), School Site 
Council, and volunteer program. 
 
 
The district adopted academic curriculum provides for basic skills, extra support, and enrichment in the general education 
classroom. We are a full 'Inclusion' and 'mainstreaming' school; strategically sup
porting children with special needs. As we 
develop our Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math program (STEAM), we offer various school
-
wide and after school 
enrichment. We have a very strong instrumental music program for fourth and fifth grade stude
nts; Meet the Masters art 
program which allows the students an opportunity to learn about famous artists and create their own masterpiece, a six 
week Starstruck dance program; STEM Squad in which parent volunteers bring science exploration and Cyberwise (d
igital 
safety/citizenship) curriculum to the classroom; and a dedicated group of parents and guardians who help each child 
create two ceramics projects to take home. Many students participate in Student Council, Theater Arts, Chess, Choir, 
Science Fair, Ma
th Bowl, Spelling Bee, Engineering, Coding, Art, Garden Club, Dashing Dragons (running club) and many 
social events during the school year. 
 
 
The staff, parents and extended family members of Oak Chan students have worked hard to create an academically and
 
socially engaging elementary school in which our children attend. We are confident that they will look back on their days 
at Oak Chan Elementary School with a smile on their face and warmth in their heart as they remember the lessons they 
learned and the 
friendships they made inside and outside of their classroom doors.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
Oak Chan Elementary was originally constructed in 1989 with a completed reconstruction in 2018 through Measure G 
Funds.
 
 
Our restrooms, student care facility, and multipurpose room are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned on a regular basis
 
with extra care given when the need arises. Our floors are mopped, vacuumed or cleaned on a regular basis. Plumbing 
and electrical systems are operational. The custodial team maintains our school to the best of their ability in the limited 
hours provided.
 
The head custodian makes efforts to ensure that the grounds are safe and attractive. Graffiti is 
immediately removed and safety issues are addressed as soon as reported. When custodians are unable to work, their 
positions are filled with substitutes. This
 
procedure ensures that bathroom facilities, eating facilities, and student care 
facilities are cleaned daily and trash emptied from the entire campus.
 
 
Our school is highly concerned with providing for student safety. Our staff reports all 
accidents that they are aware of to 
the office to ensure student safety. Minor first aid is provided whenever necessary.
 
 
Repairs to the site or equipment are made in a timely manner.  The district's maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note
 
that even minor discrepan
cies are reported in the inspection process.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula

scores.

Our school is safe and clean. Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and resolved. Safety plans are 
reviewed each fall and spring. During instructional time, our front gates and classroom doors are closed and locked. Staff 
members are d
iligent about checking that all visitors and parent volunteers have registered with the office as well as wear 
the appropriate identification badge while on campus.
 
 
Emergency plans have been developed in case a threatening situation should arise. Fire and
 
earthquake drills are 
conducted on a regular basis based on comprehensive Hour Zero training. Our school also practices active shooter lock
-
down procedures in the event of an emergency at our school site. We continue to foster a strong relationship with o
ur 
local law enforcement and emergency responders.
 
 
Utilizing yard supervisors,students are supervised during all recesses, lunches, and immediately before and after school. 
Our playground and classrooms meet or exceed all safety requirements. Parents from
 
our PTO and School Site Council 
have assisted in developing bicycle safety rules and procedures, traffic safety rules and procedures, and have worked with 
the principal on other safety concerns at Oak Chan. There were 4 reported student accidents for the 
2018
