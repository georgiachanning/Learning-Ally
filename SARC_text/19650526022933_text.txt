About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Textbooks and Instructional Materials
 
A representative group of teachers and administrators reviews instructional materials. The committee meets for a detailed com
prehensive analysis of 
materials from publishers. The material
s must meet a pre
-
established criteria based on an instructional materials evaluation tool. They are as follows:
 
 
1. Compliance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulations 2. California standards alignment
 
3. Focus on coherence within a grade and 
across grade levels
 
4. Rigor and balance
 
5. Access for all students
 
6. Assessments for progress monitoring and in support of the California assessments 7. Support for English language learners
 
8. Support for special populations
 
 
In addition to the 
items delineated above, the committee considers digital resources for staff, students and parents to support learning in vari
ed 
environments. The committee reaches a consensus, and the Board of Education makes the final decision on the chosen textbooks 
upo
n reviewing the 

 
 
Textbooks were chosen using state
-
approved lists, and the content fit within the curriculum frameworks adopted by the State Board of Education.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Parents and volunteers are referred to as 



-
time 
com
munity liaison. Volunteer assistance may be performed on site or at home. In addition, parent/family conferences with student
 
involvement, 
orientation programs, special evening events and Open House, also support the school program. There is an active Pare
nt Teacher Association assisting 
the school with fundraising activities, school
-
to
-
home communications, and various other programs for parents and students. The PTA Board also serves 
as liaison with the school community through newsletters and needs assess
ment surveys that encourages parent in
-
 
put about our school programs. The 
School Site Council, consisting of staff members, community members and parents, is involved in the planning, development, im
plementation, evaluation 
and modification of the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement. Parental involvement is expected and appreciated. We ask parents to volunteer at least 
one hour per week either at the school or by completing school support tasks at home.

School Safety Plan
 
In accordance with Senate Bill 187 and Education Code 35294.6, all schools have adopted a Safe School Action Plan. These plan
s will remain in effect 
through the school year, are reviewed ann
ually and are available for public view in the school office. Key elements and goals of the Safe School Action 
Plans are:
 
All students and staff members are provided a safe teaching and learning environment.
 
All students are safe and secure while at 
school, when traveling to and from school, and when traveling to and from school
-
related activities.
 
District programs and approved community resources are made available to students and parents.
 
Schools provide an educational environment where students, p
arents, staff and community members shall effectively communicate in a manner that is 
respectful to all cultural, racial and religious backgrounds.
 
The school safety plan was last reviewed, updated and discussed with the school faculty in September 2019.
