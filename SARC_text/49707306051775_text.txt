By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Opportunities f
or Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
ARK Education Foundation:
 

-
profit Education Foundation and Parent Group. Harmony Elementary 
School is supported on a continual basis by a network of 
parent volunteers who assist teachers and staff in and out of the 
classroom. Throughout the year volunteers work tirelessly, raising funds that support many activities and programs for 
the students and teachers at Harmony Elementary School. The ARK Educati
on Foundation is also invaluable for their 
ongoing support to Harmony Elementary School. Harmony Union School District always welcomes and appreciates our 
large community of parent volunteers.
 
 
School Site Council/Charter Advisory Board:
 
The Site Council/C
harter Advisory Board serves as the school community representative body for determining the focus 
of the school's academic instructional program and all related categorical resources. The Legislative intent for the 
formation of school site council is that
 
individuals who are most affected by the operation of the school should have a 
major role in the decisions regarding how a school functions. Education should be a joint effort of parents, teachers, 
administrators and other school staff; all who share the 
common goal in making sure our students are successful. Harmony 
Union School District's Site Council is also the district's Charter Advisory Board. This group meets once a month and 
parent/community members are elected to the Site Council/Charter Advisory 
Board every two years. The group also 
consists of teachers, classified employees, and students that are elected by their peer groups to serve a two
-
year staggered 
term. If you are interested in becoming a part of the Site Council/Charter Advisory Board ple
ase contact the school office.
 
 
Governance Committees:
 
Parents are invited to serve on ad hoc committees in the support of active projects and inquiries for the school.  Recent 
committees include the Bond Committee, Place Based Learning, and Community Conn
ections.
 
 
Harmony Union School District Board of Trustees:
 
The Board is comprised of five members, each serving a four
-
year term. Members are elected through the general election 
held in November. The Board serves for both Harmony Elementary School and Sal
mon Creek Middle School
--
A Charter 
School. Candidates must be California citizens, registered voters, and live within district boundaries. Agendas for the 
monthly meetings are posted on the school campus. The main functions of the Board are to employ and e
valuate the 
superintendent, establish district policy and monitor the budget; and to set and monitor the implementation of annual 
and long
-
range goals. To learn more, please call the superintendent at 874
-
 
1205.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Harmony Union School District maintains a school
-
wide comprehensive safety plan that is reviewed and 
updated 
annually by the School Site Council/Charter Advisory Board and the Board of Trustees. All administrative staff and key 
safety support staff have received training in National Incident Management System (NIMS) and State Emergency 
Management System (
SEMS). Throughout the year staff and students practice various safety drills (lock
-
down, fire drill, 
earthquake drill, and evacuation).  HUSD's safety committee meets multiple times a year.  A copy of the Harmony Union 
School District's Comprehensive Safet
y Plan is available for review in the district office.
