By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-

School Vision and Mission:
 
Carl Sundahl fully adopts the Folsom Cordova mission statement of being committed to providing excellence in 
educational programs that carry high expectations for each student's 
achievement and success.
 
 
Guided by the highest expectations, Folsom Cordova Unified School District provides our students with a broad range of 
rigorous educational opportunities.  Staff enables students to reach their full potential and successfully meet
 
the demands 
and opportunities of a highly technological 21st Century.
 
 
Students graduate with a core of knowledge and skills that become the building blocks for lifelong learning.  They graduate 
with a positive attitude and the leadership, character, and 
academic skills necessary to excel in a global arena.
 
 
Families are an integral part of the educational process.  In recognition of this important role, family involvement is activ
ely 
sought, encouraged, and welcomed.
 
 
Business and community 
partnerships greatly enhance students' learning experiences and educational opportunities.  
Partnerships offer students opportunities to apply their learning to real
-
world situations.
 
 
Schools serve as community hubs, places where the community gathers to 
celebrate and improve learning and to enjoy 
art, music, sports, public speaking, drama, and other school
-
related activities.  The use of school facilities by the 
community is encouraged
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
School facilities are a reflection of the
 
entire community.  We provide students with the educational tools to meet the 
technological demands of the future and the social skills to function in a culturally diverse society.
 
 
Carl H. Sundahl Elementary School has served students residing on the nor
thwest side of the American River in Folsom 
since September 1987. Carl Sundahl is a K
-
5 learning environment.  We operate on a traditional year calendar.  Our student 
enrollment, reported on the California Basic Educational System (CBEDS) in  October 2018 
was approximately 355.  Our 
campus currently houses 15 classrooms, a Learning Center and a Student Care Center.
 
 
Due to Measure G funds,Carl Sundahl has gone under a total modernization with the entire school being rebuilt over the 
last two years.  The cam
pus is brand new with beautiful new classrooms, restrooms, playgrounds, library and  Science 
Technology Engineering & Math (STEM) lab.
 
 
We have 14 general education classes and we offer Montessori education as well.  Currently, we have one Montessori 
class
 
of preschool, transitional kindergarten and kindergarten students. Our multipurpose room/cafeteria complex 
includes a stage/music room as well as a serving kitchen and indoor basketball court.   The classrooms and office complex 
are linked through a compu
ter network system that supports the instructional program technically and allows access to 
the Internet.   All classrooms are equipped with Internet access for curriculum and research support.   We currently have 
one on one Chromebooks on campus for stude
nt use in the classrooms.

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equip
ment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and
 
to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed b
y all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays in
formation about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other 
instructional materials used at the school.

Each teacher at Sundahl has his/her own classroom. The school was completely remodeled in 2016/17.  Each classroom is 
equipped with one Chrome book per student in addition to a document camera and 80" TV.   We have a large playing 
field, pla
yground area, and a basketball court area for recesses and Physical Education (P.E) classes. Our P.E. also has a 
storage area, and accessibility to the multi
-
purpose room and stage area when needed for rainy day activities.
 
 
The classrooms and office compl
ex are linked through a computer network system that supports the instructional 
programs technically and allows access to the Internet. Our school is totally networked to our LAN (local area network) 
and to the WAN (wide area network).
 
 
All restrooms are b
rand new and cleaned daily Classrooms are cleaned every third day. Heavier cleaning is done on a 
rotating basis. Items in need of simple repairs are done on the spot by our custodians. Safety issues are reported 
immediately to the District. Safety concerns
 
are the top priority for our district maintenance department and are often 
corrected the same day. We also have a School Safety Committee that discusses potential problems and ways to improve 
our school environment. Our efforts are successful because our 
staff is committed to providing a safe and clean learning 
environment for our students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
There are numerous opportunities for parent involvement at Carl Sundahl.  Parents can assist teachers in the classroom 
by working with students, copying and/or correcting papers, filing, field trip assistance, and serving as a room parent.
 
 
Parents can als
o serve as members of our Site Council.  This is an advisory group of parents and teachers that work with 
the administration on program and fiscal decisions.  Our safety committee focuses on school and community safety issues.
 
 
Our Parent Teacher Associati
on (PTA) rely totally on parent support and involvement.  The creativity, talents, and energy 
shared by our parents in numerous capacities are what enable Carl Sundahl to have the numerous and extracurricular 
activities rarely found in a public school sett
ing. We also participate with Intel in their PC Pals program where many parents 
and community volunteers  support our 5th grade students.
 
 
We work closely with local businesses to increase the learning opportunities for our students.  We are very grateful 
for all 
the support local businesses provide to our school.  Parents and community businesses are viewed as valuable assets and 
partners in our educational endeavors.
 
 
An important part of our effective home/school partnership focus is our school website: 
 
www.fcusd.org/cse.  The website 
contains information and updates on all aspects of the school program.  SchoolWires also gives parents password
-
protected access to academic progress, assignments, grades, attendance, and other key information about their c
hild.
 
 
Parents or community members who wish to participate in leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or 
become a volunteer may contact LeeAnn Larson, Administrative Assistant, Carl Sundahl  Elementary, 916

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school is safe and clean. With 19 brand new classroom on campus everything is new and in working order.   All 
restrooms are brand new and eating facilities are cleaned daily. Classrooms are cleaned every third day. Any safety hazard 
that is reported is
 
reviewed immediately and resolved. In the 2018/19 school year there were six accidents reported on 
campus.  Each accident was minor and addressed immediately.  Safety plans are reviewed each fall; maintained and 
followed throughout the school year. Emerge
ncy plans have been developed in case a threatening situation should arise.
 
 
Carl Sundahl Elementary School is very concerned about student safety and has a very involved Safety Committee.  Our 
Safety Committee meets regularly to address areas of concern a
nd to continuously update and improve our emergency 
procedures and response time. We also work very closely with the Folsom Police and Fire Departments. Evacuation routes 
are in place and an emergency folder with supplies and class lists are kept up to dat
e and easily accessible. Our Emergency 
Plan Quick Reference Guide for School Staff folder, which contains specific instructions for a variety of emergencies, is 
reviewed every year and a copy is placed in each classroom. A variety of potential emergency sc
enarios are practiced 
monthly with our students. Parents are informed of emergency plans and procedures through our Dateline Bulletin.  New 
gates have been installed at the front entrance to school.  Once school starts the gates are closed and after this t
ime all 
students and visitors are required to enter the school office to sign in.
