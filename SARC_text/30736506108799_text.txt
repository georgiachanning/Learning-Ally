By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

programs are designed and implemented to offer academic skills and 
support through supplemental funding.  The programs are designed with input from the teachers based on their 
assessments and teacher recommendation.  Progress monitoring of student progress
 
allows for flexible support.   In 
addition to general education classrooms, we serve Special Education students collaborative classroom settings and also 
three upper

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Asse
ssment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] 
and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standar
ds [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University,
 
or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Westpark School is embedded in 
a community that believes that education is a partnership between the home and the 
school. The PTA, the School Site Council, the volunteers, and support from the business community are integral to the 
ongoing success of our students. PTA provides enrichmen
t opportunities through assemblies, after school enrichment 
classes, financial support for programs, and financial support for every classroom. The School Site Council participates in 
the monitoring of our educational plan and the expenditure of funds to e
nrich our curricular foci. The volunteers 
contribute hours to the classroom through tutorial, library, computer lab and clerical support. The business community is 
also involved by supplying our school with resources to purchase equipment and other supplie
s and assemblies to enrich 
the entire school. Our parents are actively involved at our school in a variety of ways. Parents are encouraged to contribute
 
to the multicultural community at Westpark through community events and educational opportunities as we
ll as we feel 
that this is a critical piece of our Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports model.  The PTA also encourages and supports
 
the arts through support of the music program and coordination of student performances twice a year.

place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased
 
local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the service of students.  All districts receive a 
BASE of per
-
student funding that varies slightly depending on grade level.  All districts also receive SUPPLEMENTAL 
funding.  IUSD has used BA
SE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer ath
letic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support student achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Eleme
ntary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and instructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain
 
previously implemented class

Finally, CONCENTRATION grant f

income students and foster youth exceed 55 percent of the total enrollment.  Irvine Unified School District is not 
eligible for concentration funding because its
 
enrollment does not exceed the 55 percent threshold.

Westpark School and the Irvine Unified School District are 
committed to continuous professional improvement. The 
District and site have three staff development days. Teachers participate in an additional 12 hours of training throughout 
the year after school.  Staff development opportunities are also offered in the
 
afternoon and evening for teachers.  The 
2019
-
2020 goals are to increase social and emotional learning supports, innovative teaching, and to continue our work on 
data and assessment, specifically grading practices, enrichment, and student ownership of lea
rning. At Westpark we will 
provide an appropriately challenging curriculum for all students that fosters higher order thinking. We will explicitly and 
intentionally teach the language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) necessary for success
 
in all curricular 
areas; English, Social Science, Math, and Science. In providing this curriculum we will align our teaching, learning, 
assessments, and materials to content standards and the CCSS. We will provide equal access to the core curriculum and 
s
tandards
-
based instruction for students with special needs (including but not limited to English Learners, GATE, Special 
Education, and At
-
Risk students). We will use on
-
going results from multiple assessments to design and/or modify our 
instruction and us
e the data from all sources, including that from standards
-
based assessments to evaluate current 
program effectiveness and make adjustments as necessary. We will seek opportunities to develop staff expertise in 
analyzing assessment data from a variety of s
ources to improve student learning. Through the PBIS model and school AIR 
values (Accountability, Integrity, and Respect) we will support school culture and individual actions that promote positive 
behavior and district core ethical values.
