School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
 
I'd like to welcome you to Fairfax Junior High School's Annual School Accountability Report Card. In 
accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual School 
Accountability Report Card that fulfills state and federal
 
disclosure requirements. Parents will find 
valuable information about our academic achievement, professional staff, curricular programs, 
instructional materials, safety procedures, classroom environment, and condition of facilities.
 
 
Fairfax Junior High S
chool provides a warm, stimulating environment where students are actively 
involved in learning academics as well as positive values. Students receive a standards
-
based, 
challenging curriculum by dedicated professional staff based on the individual needs o
f the 
students. Ongoing evaluation of student progress and achievement helps us refine the instructional 
program so students can achieve academic proficiency. We have made a commitment to provide 
the best educational program possible for Fairfax Junior Hig
h School's students, and welcome any 
suggestions or questions you may have about the information contained in this report or about the 
school. Together, through our hard work, our students will be challenged to reach their maximum 
potential.
 
 
Mission State
ment
 
The Fairfax Junior High School students, parents, staff, and community cooperatively provide a safe, 
child
-
centered environment that builds self
-
esteem, self
-
discipline, and the essential skills for life
-
long learning.  Students are encouraged to set 
and achieve high standards and teachers work 
together to provide a quality education for all students.  The goal of curriculum and instruction is 
to enable each student to acquire the academic, social, and emotional skills necessary to compete 
successfully
 
at higher academic levels and to exercise their rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  
At Fairfax, we empower students to become intrinsically motivated learners, critical thinkers, and 
real
-
world problem solvers.  We encourage our students to colla
boratively interact with peers, 
staff, and parents to make our school and community a better place.  Our students show pride and 
learn to SOAR TO SUCCESS by showing respect, being on task, acting responsibly, and reaching for 
their personal best.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by
 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are r
equired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP i
s to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For m
ore information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact t
he school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability 
of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Fairfax Junior High School are currently being aligned to the Common Core State 
Standards. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's mos
t recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/ language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On 
Thursday, September 12, 2019 the Fairfax School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to certify the extent to w
hich textbooks and 
instructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution No. 2020
-
01 whi
ch certifies as required by Education 
Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learners, in the 
district to the extent that each 
pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to
 
use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient textbooks and instructional materials were 
provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent with 
the cycles and content of 
the curricu
lum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curri
cula. During the 2019 
-
20  school year, the Fairfax School District did not offer visual/performing arts classes and therefore did not require the 
distribution of respective textbooks and instructional materials.
