School Description
 
School Description
 
Breen Elementary School opened in August 1994 and is one of seventeen schools in the Rocklin 
Unified School District.  It serves students in kindergarten through 6th grade, with an enrollment of 
approximately 475 students.  Breen is located in the center o
f Stanford Ranch, a dynamic and 
supportive community.  The staff at Breen provides an exemplary learning environment that is 
positive and nurturing with very high academic and behavioral standards. Our primary core belief 
is that all children can learn at 
high levels.
 
 
Parent participation is appreciated and strong
ly encouraged at Breen.  We're fortunate to have 
hundreds of parent volunteers that work to improve the academic and social programs at the 
school.  Parents also actively participate with the School Site Council and Parent Teacher Club.  
Parents and staff 
are dedicated to creating a safe learning environment in which students interact 

Intervention and Supports (PBIS) Program has enhanced this atmosphere and stresses pos
itive 
relationships. Our Bobcat Awards reward program encourages students to be people of high 
character.  Breen Elementary was awarded the Silver Level by the California PBIS Coalition for their 
implementation of PBIS.
 
 
Classroom activities are designed t
o accommodate the variety of ways in which children learn best 
--
 
using all their senses while being actively engaged. Full time P.E. and VAPA (visual and performing 
arts) teachers provide students with standards
-

facilities 
are also used in the afternoon, evening, and weekends by members of our community for such 
activities as basketball, soccer, boy/girl scouts, etc. Breen was selected as a California Distinguished 
School in 2002 and 2008.
 
 
Mission 
Statement
 
The mission of Breen Elementary, a dynamic educational and nurturing school community, is to 
inspire our students to achieve their academic potential, to ignite a passion for life
-
long learning 
and to become responsible, well
-
rounded citizens by:
 
1)  fostering a collaborative environment where each student's unique potential is recognized, 
cultivated, and celebrated.

About the SARC
 
B
y February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contro
l Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Breen was built in 1994 and is aesthetically pleasing and very well maintained facility.  The staff takes pride in providing 
an excellent environment for 
student learning.  Anyone visit
ing the campus must wear an I.D. badge to ensure the safety of our students.  Supervision  is offered prior to school, during
 
the day at recesses and lunch, and after school.  District
-
wide safety checks at all facilities occur on an ongoing, scheduled bas
is.  Fire department 
inspections are also scheduled each year.  Monthly fire drills are conducted, as are bi
-

-

-
campus evacuation drill is 
also done in which all students and staff evacuate to Breen Park.
 
 
The distric
t takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the district use
s a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.  District maintenance ens
ures that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient se
rvice and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.

ent 
behaviors. We review safety issues regarding crisis response, implementing drills at recess, and planning for a school wide e
va
cuation drill.  Last 
review/update and discussion with staff:  January 2018.
