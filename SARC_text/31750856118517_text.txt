School Description
 
 
Valley View 
Elementary School is one of seventeen schools in the Rocklin Unified School District. 
The school serves students in transition kindergarten through sixth grade, with an enrollment of 
approximately 581. The school is located in the center of a dynamic and s
upportive community 
which expresses its values toward education through a high level of participation. Valley View 
Elementary School opened in 2001. 
 
 
The staff at Valley View Elementary School provides an exemplary learning environment. Academic 
learning 
is the primary focus of the school but commendably, the staff operates on the principle 
that a caring environment which fosters self
-
worth and individual development is the best road 
toward realizing such learning. Our students are able to approach all fac
ets of their learning with 
confidence and the assurance that this school is their home. Rules of conduct are explicitly taught, 
practiced and regularly reviewed leading to responsible, reflective and accountable individuals. The 
staff welcomes the direct i
nvolvement of the community in these efforts. At Valley View Elementary 
School, parents and staff together are dedicated to creating a safe and orderly learning 
environment in which all students interact positively with others and are able to develop 
respo
nsibility, confidence and self
-
worth while achieving their highest potential.
 
 
Parents play an important role in Valley View Elementary School through active participation and 
involvement in School Site Council and PTC. Parents share information with 
classes about 
professional lives, teach special skills, work on school and playground improvements, conduct 
fundraisers, coordinate after school clubs, and make tremendous time and financial donations. 
Over 300 parents/guardians/grandparents and community 
members regularly volunteer their 
services in our classrooms, playground, computer lab and library. 
 
 
Valley View Elementary School is a focal point and center for students and the community. Our 
facilities are used many afternoons, evenings and weekends by our students as well as other 
members of our community.
 
 
The mission of Valley View Elementary Schoo
l, a distinguished leader in educational excellence, is 
to empower all students to become critical thinkers, effective communicators, and engaged 
collaborators who demonstrate passion and independence in order to thrive academically and 
personally through:

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accou
ntability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
a
nd Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reporte
d in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LC
AP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district 
office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The school is a safe, beautiful facility which opened in August 2001.  It is aesthetically pleasing as well as being an excel
len
t environment for student 
learning. Valley View has a comprehensive safety and crisis intervention plan. Students are supervised on the playground befo
re school and immediately 
after school.  During the school day students are encouraged to team up with a 
buddy whenever they leave the classroom. All visitors on campus check 
in at the office before proceeding to classrooms. Classrooms are cleaned every other day.  Our school is regularly inspected 
and maintained by district 
maintenance and grounds personnel.
 
 
New single ply roofing was added in the summer of 2011.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effort, the d
istrict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of Cali
fornia Office of Public School Construction.  District maintenance ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school 
sites in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient se
rvice and 
that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.
