Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At  Burbank everyone will grow in a safe and supportive enviroment, while developing a life long desire to learn.  In order 
to achieve our mission Burbank Elementary will align with Modesto City Sch
ools' strategic goals and utilizes  
Communication, Collaboration, and Celebration as a road map to our destination.
 
 
COMMUNICATE: Information regarding the Common Core State Standards is presented to all stakeholders. Presentations 
to parents occur during 
Site Council, English Language Parent Partnership, Parent Involvement and Engagement, and 
Parent Cafe. Teachers gain information through District and site trainings. Academic and behavioral expectations are 
established school
-
wide and communicated through 
parent conferences, site level meetings, and school publications. 
Burbank Elementary is committed to increasing the level of communication with all parents, students and staff.
 
 
COLLABORATE: Teachers meet on Minimum Days to analyze and create plans of acti
on to increase the level of student 
achievement. Our instructional staff works diligently to prepare our students for the Common Core State Standards and 
assessments by designing and delivering instruction that is both rigorous and relevant.
 
 
Burbank is co
mmitted to highlighting effective instructional practices and acquiring the resources necessary to achieve 
our goals. Parents are actively sought as partners in our school improvement endeavors. Volunteering is encouraged both 
at the classroom level as wel
l as school
-
wide through committees and special projects.
 
 
Parent Cafe meetings are designed to provide parents with information and learning opportunities that will assist them in 
working with their students at home. Site administration works with student
s, teachers, and parents at the school level as 
well as with district leadership to strengthen partnerships and build better understanding of our goal to raise the level of 
student achievement at Burbank Elementary.
 
 
CELEBRATE: Through our efforts to communicate and collaborate, we are committed to celebrating the accomplishments 
of our school community. Student recognition programs for attendance, academic, and character achievements are 
implemented. Students are reco
gnized for their accomplishments via school
-
wide messages, newsletters, and the 
district/school website. We will know that we as a school community of staff, parents and students have achieved our 
vision when all students who pass through our hallways leav
e Burbank as successful, academically and socially capable, 
self
-
reliant problem
-
solvers who are being prepared to be College and Career ready.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict

y survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Based on the latest Williams Act Facility Inspection (9

Burbank rece

address areas that are in need of repair.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions 
and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservice
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school work
shops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an extra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus
 
on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to the needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates an
d the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the qualit
y and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
