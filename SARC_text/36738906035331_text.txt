By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

procedure
s, current status of school crime, notification to teachers, child abuse reporting procedures, school

code, routine and emergency drills, sexual harassment policy, policies related to suspension and expulsion, maintaining a 
safe and orderly scho
ol environment, safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school employees.
 
 
The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state 
earthquake standards . Safety drills are held throughout
 
the year.  Fire drills are held monthly, earthquake drills are held 
twice a year and intruder drills are held three times a year.
