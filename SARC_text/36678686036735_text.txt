Two of theaccomplishments we are most proud of are the top yearly attendance rates in the district and
recertification at the Silver level of implementation for PBIS.The district set a goal of 95% attendance for the year to meet the state level of acceptableattendance of at least 95%.  CHE beat that goal at 95.44%.  Last year we were the highest in
the district at 94.8%.  We are proud of our continued growth.  Our goal is to reach 96% this year.
 The state will reward the school with a financial bonus if we are above 96%.  In a time of
reduced budgets, this would greatly benefit our site.  The state of California believes that at least
95% attendance is optimal for student learning.  At 90% or lower, students are classified as
truants, for they are missing at least 10% of the school instruction.  If someone were to ask you
for 10% of your salary, you would feel quite an impact.  This is the same for our children when
they miss 10% of the school or more.  They lose out on important concepts that they must
struggle to learn as well as not feeling as connected to their teacher, classmates, and school.
Those relationship are important as student practice the character traits which are essential to
learn how to relate with others. CHE has also implemented the STAR (Saturday Tutoring Attendance Recovery) program toassist parents in reducing chronic absence rates.  Once a month, students may attend Saturday
School from 8-12 am where learning is blended with fun and parents can avoid the SART
(Student Attendance Review Team) process regarding chronic absences.PBIS, Positive Behavior and Intervention Supports, is an initiative across the country to createan atmosphere in school where students are happy to come, feel loved and are nurtured toward
success. Schoolwide behavior expectations are explicitly taught- Be Safe, Be Respectful, and
Be Responsible, and rewards for maintaining that behavior are applicable to all. Those students
who need more support to make correct choices are given opportunities to learn and practice in
small groups or individually. California has a recognition system for implementation of
implementation in 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19.As a staff we work to create a positive, caring atmosphere for students individually, as well asparents and community, and ourselves. We recognize that when a staff respects each other and
works together the climate of the school is one where we all want to be. We recognize our
partnership with parents and community is crucial and we work to build those relationships. The
school is here to support the family!We teach the California State Standards using Go Math and Journeys textbooks. We haveincreased the rigor in reading, writing and mathematics.  We are also teaching the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in all grades to prepare for the new state mandated 5th
grade science test.  Last year we implemented a new math textbook series, Go Math, and this
year are implementing a new English Language Arts textbook series, Journeys. This will notably
increase the rigor in our math, reading, and writing lessons. We look for students being more
confident in their abilities.At CHE we believe and stand by our Parent Engagement Policy:All parents want the best for their children.
All families have something great to offer.
We strive to work together with parents to ensure each student's success. 
We want all to feel comfortable here.Charles Hoffman Elementary School22018-19 School Accountability Report CardMission Statement
At Charles Hoffman Elementary, the principal, teachers, and
support staff serve collaboratively and openly, for each is

important to our purpose. We know our relationships with each

other, students, parents, and community are key.  Our students
belong to all of us.  We will nurture the successful student in

each child.
School Vision
At Charles Hoffman Elementary we guide our students in their
academic, emotional, and social learning through adherence to
state standards and an aligned curriculum that is utilized
consistently. We provide academic supports through Response
to Intervention (RtI) and behavioral supports through PBIS with
caring relationships.  We encourage consistent attendance in a
positive and safe culture.  Using a growth mindset, students and

staff see that some learning may be challenging and still a

worthwhile endeavor.
ﬁI can learn to do anything I want.ﬂ
S
:At Charles Hoffman Elementary we believe in the promise of
public education where students from varied backgrounds,
ethnicity, and abilities learn how to navigate the social waters
while obtaining an education that delivers a college and career
ready young adult.  We believe that every adult working at the
site is important to student growth as visibility doesn™t equal
value.  We believe that students must feel safe at school and
know the parameters for behavior; what is expected in each area
of the school and to be rewarded for appropriate choices. We
believe that students must be in school in order to learn.  We
believe that all students are capable of deep learning when
instruction is differentiated and as each student is nurtured
toward success.  We believe students can be college and career
ready.  We believe in providing a system of supports for needs,
academic,  behavioral and emotional.

students in grade five. The physical fitness test measures each
student's ability to complete fitness tasks in six major areas.
Students who either meet or exceed the standards in all six
fitness areas are considered to be in the "healthy fitness zone."
The chart reported in this document reports only the percentage
in each category, not a cumulative total of the results for
categories 4 of 6 and 5 of 6. Comparative district and state
results can be found at the CDE's website.Physical Fitness TestPercentage of Students Meeting California Fitness Standards2018-19Percentage of Students Meeting StandardsGrade LevelTestedFour of Six FitnessStandardsFive of Six FitnessStandardsSix of Six FitnessStandardsFifth20.436.712.2Note: Percentages are not calculated and double dashes (--) appear in the tablewhen the number of students tested is ten or less, either because the number of

Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the general
education population, and the California Alternate Assessments
(CAAs) for students with the most significant cognitive
disabilities.  Only eligible students may participate in the
administration of the CAAs.  CAAs items are aligned with
alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the
Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a
measure of how well students are mastering California's
standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and
mathematics, and are given to grades three through eight andgrade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance inELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests
and performance tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with
alternative achievement standards which are linked with the
Common Core State Standards (CCSS).Charles Hoffman Elementary School32018-19 School Accountability Report CardThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall resultscomparing the school, district and state scores as well as theschool's overall score in each applicable subgroup.
