About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The selection of focus areas for on
-
going professional development is based on a careful analysis of achievement data, school needs and staff input. The 
district calendar earmarks 2 full professional growth days and 6 days with early release time for provi
ding site
-
based professional development for all 
teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences and district
-
wide professional development throughout the year, including 5 early
-
release days for district
-
focused learning. Conferences and 
professional workshops are selected by teachers with the principal's guidance to ensure that 
the professional learning involves strategies with rigor and relevance towards meeting our objectives. Areas of focus for tea
cher training for the last 
three acade
mic years, 2016

2019, have included effective instructional strategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, 
best practices for Data Teams collaboration, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathematics, specific tr
aining to support the needs of 
English Learners, innovative approaches in instructional content/delivery, as well as increased awareness and planning around
 
school safety, and ways 
to support and strengthen our school culture. Teachers of students with spe
cial needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized 
training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various f
ormats, including whole staff, 
targeted groups, grade
-
level t
eams, and through individual mentoring by the school administrator. During the implementation process, teachers are 
supported through teacher
-
principal meetings and student performance reporting on grade level data team collaboration days. As part of grade
 
level 
collaboration, teachers share ideas, strategies and resources that were learned during professional growth trainings and revi
ew student progress on 
specific English Language Arts and Mathematics units. The district also assists in the coordination o
f support services under the Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment (BTSA) Induction Program for Year One and Year Two Beginning Teachers. Teachers who are experiencing difficult
ly or need 
improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Progr
am.
