By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
At William Green, we are exceedingly proud of the
 
quality of our school facility and its support of teaching and learning. 
The two
-
year modernization of our campus was completed in May 2002. Originally built in 1952, all permanent 
classrooms, offices and buildings received a comprehensive upgrading. The 
school has 46 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room, a library, preschool classrooms, program office, workroom and administration building. Bungalows were added 
each year from 2000
-
2003 to accommodate an expanding enrollment and Class Size Reduction. 
 
 
The schoo
l playground area in combination with the park facilities, provide demarcated play and sports areas that support 
our standards
-
based physical education programs. In addition to the modernization of our classrooms, the 1.9
-
acre park 
adjacent to our school (
William Green Park) was fully upgraded and improved in Fall 2014. Complete with a baseball 
diamond, large grassy field, basketball courts and two large play apparatuses, this facility is used by our students for 
recesses and P.E. and noon sports during the
 
school day, and as a community park after school and on weekends. A chain
-
link fence lines the perimeter of the park and is kept locked during school hours.
 
 
Improvements made after modernization
 

 
Installation of filtered drinking fountain and bottle 
refilling station
 

 
A complete Kitchen renovation was completed in 2015.

William Green School takes great efforts to ensure that its campus and student learning environments are clean, safe and 
functional consistent with the Williams Act. Uniform Complaint Procedure notifications are posted in all classrooms
 
and 
offices. The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Restrooms have been 
upgraded and are monitored at regular intervals throughout the day by the custodial and administrative staff. 100% of 
toilets, fa
ucets and hand dryers are functional. The principal and assistant principal work daily with the custodial team to 
develop cleaning schedules and target areas to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary 
to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is currently used to facilitate efficient service, provide 
regular status reports and ensure that emergency repairs are given the highest
 
priority.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We 
have made it a top priority at William Green to plan and implement procedures that ensure the safety of all students. 
During the school day, all gates are locked and all visitors must enter through the administrative offices and follow a sign
-
in procedure.
 
All parents, guardians or older siblings of students in grades TK
-
3 must make direct contact with their primary 

areas and are under the
 
supervision of personnel hired by the school and District. Children participating in school 
sponsored after
-
school activities are either under the supervision of credentialed teachers or after school program 
personnel hired by the District for that purpos
e.
 
 
William Green developed a comprehensive School Safety Plan. The comprehensive plan was reviewed and updated by 
staff in October of 2019. This plan provides for emergency procedures for all events, including fire, earthquake, disasters, 
lockdown, terror
ism and police actions. This plan also covers daily procedures such as locked gates, closed campus 
guidelines, visitor sign
-
in procedures and supervision. As a school we participate also in safety drills such as earthquake, 
fire, and lockdown drills to pra
ctice procedures and routines.

Number of school days dedicated to St
aff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The LESD Education Services team in collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, Math TOSAs, English Language 
Instructional Resource Teachers and Principals have designed a comprehensive system for 
monthly professional 
development.  All district professional development occurs on Thursdays after school following an early release day.   
Topics are selected based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  All professional developme
nt in 
the LESD focuses on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the implementation of research based 
practices to support student achievement.
 
 
Professional development focuses on the instructional shifts needed to meet the rigorous dem
ands of the Common Core 
State Standards and the need to support development of academic discourse for all students, with an emphasis on English 
language learners.  All TK
-
5th grade teachers receive professional development support in the areas of Socio emo
tional 
learning, Math warm
-
ups, and integrated ELD. Collaboration time is spent on data analysis and planning in the areas of 
English Language Arts, Math, and ELD. Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles that afford them 
the opportun
ity to learn about a new concept, plan for implementation with their colleagues, practice their learning with 
students, and then come back with their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional 
implementation of the new skill.
 
 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the professional development is regularly collected to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team members regularly 
visit classro
oms to determine the level of implementation of the professional development focus.
