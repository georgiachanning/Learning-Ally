Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The 
district makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the district use
s 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
surve
y are available at the school office and at the district office.
 
 
Hubbard School was built in 1961. School facilities were renovated according to the Field Act requirements of the State 
Building Code with a focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asb
estos and lead containing building materials may 
be found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, and Local requirements. Deferred 
maintenance funds have been used to properly maintain and renovate district buildings. N
eeded repairs and maintenance 
projects are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Whenever possible, school facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient 
classroom, office, library, playground, staff space, and 

the instructional program. The Alum Rock School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, 
ensure the school buildings and grounds are safe, clean, and in g
ood repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that 
classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens, eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and staff use.  
Regular oversight by district maintenance crews ensures that grass and la
ndscaped areas are well maintained, and that 

 
 
Hubbard has a new administration building, built in 2009, and the old administration building was renovated into a modern 
school library.  All the
 
adult bathrooms and half of the student bathrooms were remodeled and conform to the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act requirements. The school cafeteria now has central air conditioning and the school public 
address system is updated with digita
l clocks and varying sound communication options to help in disasters and in reducing 
classroom disruptions.
 
 
Our new middle school wing is complete for 6th
-
8th grade grade. Our middle school wing has new student and teacher 
restrooms, which are compliant 
with Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
requirements.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.
