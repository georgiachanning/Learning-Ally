About the SARC
 
By F
ebruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control F
unding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
sta
te and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessme
nts 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

drills. Within the Student/Parent Handbook, Adequate playground supervision is maintained at
 
all times. Students are educated on the dangers of drug 
and alcohol abuse during Red Ribbon Week, peer pressure, and the importance of making positive life choices through Sanford H
armony, Second Step, 
Be a Buddy, and Schoolwide Mustang Expectations Assem
blies. Additionally, our School Safety Patrol helps ensure the physical and emotional security 
of our students as they walk to and from school each day.

Each year, targeted professional improvement activities are provided for teachers, instructional assistants, and other suppor
t staff. Activities reflect the 
school's 
goals and objectives and are part of our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement.
 
 
This year at TMES, our learning focus is to work towards increasing academic achievement and develop social and emotional lea
rning to inspire 
collaborative conversations & corpo

(CASEL) model to guide our work. This is our second year as a Sanford Harmony Demonstration School. All of our teachers are u
sing the S
anford Harmony 
curriculum daily within the classroom and during our school
-
wide buddies. Also, we have partnered with I heart Chula Vista to have a Trauma Therapist 
Wanda Brothers train our staff and community on Attachment, Anxiety, Mental Health, Stress,
 
and Coping Strategies.
 
We believe that this shift will help yield positive results for our students to develop their ability to solve problems and c
ommunicate their thinking in all 
areas of life, including math. As a community, we are building all areas o
f the brain so we can inspire students to take ownership of their learning. 
Specifically, we have three professional learning cycles. First quarter focused on the meetup. The second quarter was the bud
dy up. Third quarter we 
tapped into our students' abili
ty to collaborated and talk with their peers ad they build their problem
-
solving skills. Teachers received training on the 
math block, three reads protocol, and math data review. Within all three cycles, teachers had professional readings. Our site
 
ILT tea
m paved the way for 
teacher learning and creating an environment for staff to thrive.
 
 
The primary focus during the 2017/2018 was to develop the growth mindset of staff and students through goals and the success 
criteria. Professional 
development was held 
to support teachers. Students also received lessons on growth mindset. A professional development cycle was created to suppor
t 
the implementation of success criteria in the area of problem
-
solving. Professional developments were held during the teacher con
tract hour. ILT 
meetings attended cohort sessions to support building the capacity of the ILT members. During the cycle, teachers read profes
sional readings, visited 
peer classes and discuss student performance. In additional teachers received support from
 
the principal and Resource teacher during admin designated 
collaboration time. Furthermore, there was a site
-
wide interest and investment into Sanford Harmony Social Emotional curriculum. Teachers received 
professional development from National University
 
Harmony training team on how to successfully implement Harmony within the classroom.  This was 
also done with the use of visible learning strategies such as Metacognition Strategies, Learner Goals, Learning Intentions, R
eflection and Evaluation. 
Training 
last year included, but was not limited to: See..Think..Wonder, ELPAC, Data Review, Technology, Illuminate, NGSS, GATE, Metac
ognitive 
Strategies, Benchmark Education, Problem Solving in Math, Achieve 3000, Smarty Ants, Harmony, Safety training, Social and
