Description
 
Wade Thomas School is located in Marin County and is one of four elementary schools in the Ross 
Valley School District serving kindergarten through fifth grade students. It is located in one of San 

he site of the original grammar school built in 1898. 
San Anselmo is a small town within commuting distance from San Francisco. Our student 
population draws from a community of professionals and artisans as well as students from the 
nearby San Francisco Th
eological Seminary. At Wade Thomas, we place a high value on social 
emotional learning and community, in addition to academic excellence. Wade Thomas received the 
California Distinguished School Award in 2018. In the 2018
-
2019 school year, eighty
-
seven per
cent 
(83%) of our students met or exceeded standards on the ELA portion of the California Assessment 
of Student Performance and Progress; eighty
-
five percent (81%) achieved the same levels on the 
Math assessment. 
 
 
Wade Thomas envisions a program that cult
ivates compassionate, inquisitive, reflective learners 
with the skills needed to live and work in the 21st Century. We believe all children can learn, be 
successful, and contribute to a changing world. The Wade Thomas mission is to provide 
comprehensive le
arning experiences based on best practices and creative teaching:
 

 
Where students will develop confidence in their ability to think for themselves, analyze 
a variety of situations, find creative solutions, and develop a love of learning;
 

 
Where students will
 
approach the world beyond their immediate community with a 
sense of respect, wonder and responsibility;
 

 
Where students will be challenged to reach their highest learning potential within a 
rigorous academic context enriched by access to the arts.
 

 
Where st
udents become self
-
motivated, life
-
long learners.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Ross Valley School District passed a $41 million facility bond in November 2010 to accommodate increased enrollment and r
eplacement and/or 
repairs at Wade Thomas and other schools in the district. Wade Thomas Ele
mentary added 3 new classrooms and a playground during the summer of 
2015.
 
 
Ross Valley School District uses Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and the least toxic method of pest control possi
ble as a means to control 
unwanted pests. In accordance
 
with AR 3514.2 IPM strategy focuses on long
-
term prevention or suppression of pest problems through a combination of 
techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing treatment threshold levels, using non
-
chemical practices to make the habi
tat less 
conducive to pest development, improving sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the
 
least possible hazard 
and are effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are use
d only after careful monitoring indicates they are 
needed according to established guidelines and treatment thresholds. ( California Education Code §17609; Food and Agricultura
l Code§ 13181)

School Safety Plan
 

developed in coordination 
with Marin County emergency 
agencies such as Ross Valley Policeand Ross Valley Fire Department . Our plan includes procedures for earthquake, fire, 
and lock down drills and shelter in place.  The school community practices a variety of emergency drills on a scheduled basis
. The numbe
r of drills is 
determined by California Education Code.  Students are trained to play active roles in these drills.  School Administrators a
nd staff attend annual trainings 
to better prepare the school for unanticipated emergencies. The plan includes proce
dures for disaster preparedness and response. Our site's emergency 
plan includes a complete NIMS chart, training includes search and rescue, basic first aid, and student release. Our emergency
 
supply container is checked 
and re
-
stocked yearly.
 
 
Board polic
ies on suspension and expulsion, procedures to notify teachers of dangerous pupils, sexual harassment, school
-
wide dress code, procedures 
of safe ingress and egress of pupils and rules and procedures on school discipline are also components of the plan. Th
e plan may be reviewed in detail at 
the school site.
 
 
The District has installed window film for safety and security at each site. All door locks have been checked and only requir
e a push button or simple 
motion to remove a door block  to lock and secure e
ach room.  In addition, the telephone system allows each school to call 911 and to contact the District 
in the event of an emergency.  Also, the walkies talkie system has been upgraded for each site to contact the District and al
l school personnel have wal
kie 
talkies to communicate at the site level.

form o
f a mini

conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Int
egration 
Techniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we 
have a cadre of literacy coaches who 
are in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.
