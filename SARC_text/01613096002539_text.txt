By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
Corvallis School, although part of the San Lorenzo Unifi
ed School District, is situated in the Washington Manor area of San 
Leandro. Corvallis has an ethnically diverse population. The school houses 20 self
-
contained classrooms, although staff at 
and across grade levels work in a collaborative way. The staff al
so includes three special day class (SDC) teachers, a 
resource specialist, a part time EL TSA, a Literacy/Intervention TSA and instructional assistants for resource, SDC, and 
bilingual instructional assistants. In addition, an instructional assistant provi
des library support services to the school. A 
speech and language specialist, psychologist, PE specialists, and music teacher provide their services to the school. A COST 
and Student Success Team (SST) meets with teachers and parents to address concerns re
lated to student progress.
 
 
The Corvallis staff has developed a mission statement that reflects what we hope to accomplish working together with 
students, parents, and community:
 

 

 
in a challenging, problem solving, integrated, multi
-
modality instructional program to ensure their academic and social success.  This academically rigorous learning 
environment will empower all participants to become lifelong learners and productive memb
ers of society."
 
 
A major emphasis is in transitioning to Common Core Standards in the areas of English language arts, math and English 
Language Development (ELD). A focus for the school and the district is improving literacy as well as incorporating 
techn
ology in the classroom in meaningful ways. The staff continues our thoughtful and deliberate collaboration to 
enhance the learning environment for all. The staff also continues to work on building skills required in shared decision 
making and developing co
nsensus. Training is being provided in Restorative Practices. Parents and members of the 
community are encouraged to work with the staff in creating a safe, positive learning environment where all stakeholders 
have a voice.
 
 
District Mission Statement
 
The 
mission of San Lorenzo Unified School District is to work together with parents and the community to develop critical 
and creative thinkers who are knowledgeable, responsible, caring participants who contribute to a changing world.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school consists of 20 general education classrooms, two music rooms, a library, computer lab, staff room, and eight 
rooms for specialists (SDC, resource specialist program [RSP], speech,
 
Literacy/Intervention, PE, and English Language (EL) 

space for three office personnel. All classrooms have been wired to allow for I
nternet and phone access. Each classroom 
has a computer and most students in fourth and fifth grades use laptop computers as part of the classroom curriculum. 
Additional technology (tablets and chromebooks) have been purchased to be shared by grade level t
eachers. Two pieces 
of playground equipment were purchased to replace unsafe and inadequate playground structures. The kindergarten 
structure was replaced in Fall 2006 and an addition to the primary structure was also completed.

Corvallis Elementary Schoo
l has been allocated 92.5 hours of custodial time per week and the services of a District 
maintenance crew to ensure that the school and grounds are clean and well maintained.
 
 
Our school has guidelines for dealing with earthquakes, fires, and other emerge
ncy situations. Students are monitored by 
staff supervisors while on the playground during school
-
sponsored recesses or other assigned outdoor activities.
 
 
Facility improvements include the library, which was expanded and modernized during the summer
 
of 2007. It now 
includes student computer stations and expanded book collection stacks. In addition, the playground blacktop areas have 
been resurfaced. The exterior of the school was painted during the Summer of 2014. New outdoor railings were installed 
in 2015. During the summer of 2016, a new drop off/pick up loop was constructed along with new parking areas in front 
of the school. This has improved the traffic at the school. There is an additional need for landscaping in front of the schoo
l 
to improve 
the school's curb appeal. Although the outside of the school has been painted, the inside of the classrooms 
have not been painted in many years.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Corvallis prides itself in providing the staff and students with a safe, orderly, and attractive environment. Our Corvallis 
School Safety Plan was developed with input from students, parents, and staff. The School Safety Plan addresses 
preparedn
ess for response to earthquake, fire, and intruders. The School Safety Plan also outlines procedures to ensure a 
safe, orderly environment for staff, students, and school visitors. This plan is reviewed and updated yearly.
 
 
All school staff members are exp
ected to wear identification badges, and we require that every visitor on campus sign in 
at the office. We work with the city of San Leandro and the County of Alameda, who perform safety checks to assure that 
the school facilities meet fire and structural 
safety standards. Each classroom in the school is equipped with a telephone 

are employed at Corvallis to monitor the activities of t
he students before school, at lunch recess, and after school.
