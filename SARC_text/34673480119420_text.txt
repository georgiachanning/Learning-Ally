By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
20)
 
 
Vernon E. Greer Elementary School is committed to achie
ving academic excellence by implementing goal setting practices 
and capitalizing on learner talents and strengths to personalize learning. We strive to create a safe and welcoming 
environment which fosters the development of caring, responsible, and engage
d learners that are prepared to meet the 
challenges of being citizens in a culturally diverse, technologically advanced, and scientifically progressive society. Our 
dedicated staff, supportive families, and generous community work collaboratively to build 
a bright future for all learners.
 
 
At Vernon E. Greer Elementary, we strive to...
 
 
Create well rounded, engaging, and academically challenging learning
 
experiences which capitalize on talents, strengths, and interests.
 
 
Use goal setting practices to achie
ve personal growth towards meeting or exceeding grade level standards in preparation 
for college and career.
 
 
Develop crucial life skills through social and emotional lessons.
 
 
Deepen mathematical knowledge in order to develop financial literacy.
 
 
Balance informational and literary texts while fostering reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.
 
 
Participate in professional development as models of lifelong learning.
 
 
Acknowledge talents, strengths, and interests when collaborating as a profe
ssional learning community.
 
 
Communicate and collaborate with families so learners reach their greatest potential.
 
 
We are very proud of the many hours parents and community members provide to us each month. Parents are encouraged 
and welcomed to participa
te in the education of their children by serving on school committees or as classroom 
volunteers. We are thankful for a very active and supportive Greer "Pardners" in Education, English Language Advisory 
Committee, and School Site Council.
 
 
All learners ha
ve a Personalized Learning Plan. This plan is developed collaboratively with administration, teachers, 
parents, and the learner to ensure academic progress. The PLP profile includes learner strengths, interests, and goals.
 
 
Individual strengths and talents
 
are recognized. Teachers are committed to becoming strengths
-
based educators. Through 
strengths spotting activities, our primary learners identify talents that can be productively applied. Our intermediate 
learners complete the GALLUP Strength Survey to i
dentify their top three talents. At Vernon E. Greer Elementary, 
educators are discovering their own talents and developing and applying strengths as they help learners do the same in 
learning and completing academic tasks to optimal levels of personal exce
llence.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with
 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requireme
nts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Vernon E. 
Greer Elementary School Safety Plan was last updated in February 2019.
 
 
Student safety is a priority at Vernon E. Greer Elementary School. All gates remain locked throughout most of the school 
day with admittance to the campus only though the main office. 
Any visitor is required to check in at the school office. 

e 
that students are safe on campus before, during, and after school. Eigh
t yard supervisors work before school and 
throughout the school day to monitor student safety in crosswalks, on campus, on the playground, and in the cafeteria. 
Staff meetings are held for yard supervisors which provide on
-
going training and address safety
 
issues. All district 
employees wear a picture identification badge so that they can be clearly identified. School safety rules are well 
established and are enforced by all staff members.
 
 
The district has developed a comprehensive emergency plan in conjun
ction with the Galt Police and Fire Departments, 
which describes specific procedures for all types of emergencies. The plan is updated every fall and spring. Our school
-

es, fires, floods and chemical 
spills. School sites have an evacuation plan and a shelter
-
in
-
place plan. These emergency drills are conducted regularly.
 
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that Vernon E. Greer Elementary School is clean, safe, and f
unctional. To assist 
with this, the district provides three full time custodial staff to clean and maintain the school on a regular basis. In addi
tion, 
school safety inspections are periodically conducted by the Schools Insurance Authority of Sacramento Co
unty.

Our school social worker programs helps keep all lear
ners supported through their school years. Though school dropouts 
are rare in the elementary grades, enough knowledge exists to be able to identify the children who are at
-
risk of dropping 
out of school at a later age. Our social worker is responsible for 
various programs aimed at reducing or eliminating the 
high risk factors that interfere with learning. Our social worker provides support to our students and staff, support to our 
families, works with attendance intervention, and provides ongoing workshops.
 
 
Health services are under the supervision of a qualified school nurse. Vision screening, hearing tests, first aid and health 
counseling are among the services. Our district nurse, along with our school health clerk, are available to address health 
proble
ms that interfere with the learning process.

Professional learning is an important part of the planned school program at Vernon E. Greer 
Elementary School and the 
Galt Joint Union Elementary School District. Our teachers and support staff are committed to using research
-
based 
instructional strategies. The district provided three professional learning days for certificated staff in 2015
-
2016
, 2016
-
2017, 2017
-
2018, and in the current 2018
-
19 school year.  Additionally, the district provided collaboration time following 
the professional learning days which allowed teachers were able to strategically make plans and reflect on their new 
learning.
 
 
Professional development has supported the successful implementation of the California Common Core Standards with a 
focus on personalization. Teachers and support staff are encouraged to attend learning events that cater to their personal 
learning needs.
 
Our site leadership team plays an important part in the implementation of the personalization model and 
for increasing professional capacity. Staff learning events, strategic release days, and collaborative Wednesdays have been 
used for professional devel
opment opportunities.
 
 
New teachers and teachers seeking additional assistance are supported by BTSA providers. They meet regularly with an 
experienced mentor to discuss their successes and challenges and new ideas for their classrooms.
