About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which de
scribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information a
bout SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Since 1988, 
California has sought to provide intensive learning experiences for beginning teachers.  To provide an effective transition i
nto the teaching 
career for the first
-
year and second
-
year teachers, several programs have been developed statewide and are in use 
in our district.  The Beginning Teacher 
Support and Assessment (BTSA Induction Program) and Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) programs extend individual support and t
raining and support 
success in the practice of teaching.
 
Professional growth activities are
 
planned annually based on current needs and input received from staff.  Professional development days allow for 
teachers to learn new strategies to ensure student success, collaborate with colleagues in areas such as lesson planning, dat
a disaggregation, 
and 
technology integration.  Workshops on professional effectiveness and classroom skills focus on reading and math standards and
 
alignment with classroom 
curriculum.
 
Committees comprised of teachers and administrators review curriculum and adoptions for m
athematics, language arts, history
-
social science, and 
science and align them with state standards.
