PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
 
 
Sierra Hills School is dedicated to excellence and committed to success for all students.  At Sierra 
Hills, the faculty, students, and parents work together in order to provide a safe and nurturing 
environment for all students.  We provide opportunities fo
r the children to develop positive self
-
concepts and a positive attitude toward school and learning.  Student success is recognized and 
celebrated regularly with site
-
wide positive behavior goals and rewards as well as individual 
character and academic awa
rds, Student of the Week presentations and "HOOT Loot" drawings.  
These are among the many ways that achievements, hard work, effort, and good citizenship are 
recognized.  Our teachers challenge students to think critically, integrate all areas of their le
arning 
to solve real
-
world problems and bring academic pursuits to life by providing interesting, creative 
and challenging lessons that emphasize high standards for all.  Our students benefit from 
curriculum enhanced by designated music, physical education
, Spanish, science, technology, and 
library instruction. Enrichment opportunities throughout the year include our after school Robotics 
Club lunchtime Running Club, and a reading cafe. Parent volunteers regularly assist teachers in 
classrooms and with extr
acurricular activities.
 
 
We are grateful for the wonderful parental and community support we experience daily.  Sierra 
Hills is indeed a great place to work and learn.
 
 
SCHOOL PROFILE
 
 
Sierra Hills School is a Transitional Kindergarten through 3rd
-
grade sc
hool nestled in the Sierra 
Nevada foothills and is the foundation school whose children move as a group to the neighboring 
Weimar Hills School for their 4th through 8th
-
grade education.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, 
the Sierra Hills campus has approxima
tely 360 students.  Located in the small town of Meadow 
Vista, the school serves children from several rural communities covering 69 square miles.  Our 
twenty
-
four
-
year
-
old, ten
-
acre school site was planned and built intentionally to serve primary 
students
.  The building of our school was the culmination of a fifteen
-
year project designated to 
accommodate a growing population of families choosing to raise children in a country environment.   
A large community park borders our campus.  While our families are
 
primarily in the middle of the 
socioeconomic range, the school serves a diverse population in terms of student abilities and needs.
 
 
Sierra Hills School is an exemplary school offering challenging learning experiences in a supportive 
and caring atmosphere
.  The school is committed to our vision of preparing each child to become 
a literate, thinking and caring person.  To that end, our school nurtures the strengths of each 
individual, acknowledges and appreciates the uniqueness of each child and sets clear,
 
reasonable 
and rigorous academic and behavioral expectations.  Sierra Hills School is in its third year of Positive 
Behavior, Intervention, and Supports (PBIS) training this year.  The community has embraced our 
philosophy of HOOT (Helpful, Outstanding, O
wnership, and Truthful) as the basis for our school 
culture, and we received Gold status recognition from the California PBIS Coalition for our 
implementation of this program.

The warm and caring tone is set as children are personally greeted each day when they arrive on the school bu
s or are delivered by parents 
in our "kiss and drop" zone.  Many parents stay to volunteer in the children's classes.  A chorus of good
-
byes and a flurry of high fives and 
hugs follow the trail to each group of children as their teachers deliver them to th
e safety of their waiting parent or a friendly bus driver.  
Our staff reflects the values, goals, and standards of our students' families.  Because they prize the quality of life in our
 
community, many 
of our teachers live within our district.  As a measur
e of the stability of our community and staff, a number of our students' parents were 
taught by our teachers and the majority of our staff members have, or have had, their children attend our district schools.  
Our school is 
the beginning link to an ongoin
g relationship between our two district schools and the small communities served.  The school lays the 
groundwork to create a tightly knit unit consisting of the school, the students, their parents and extending families, the co
mmunity and 
local merchants.
  
Our campus, with its large gym, is the community center.  From the Lion's Club Mother's Day breakfast, annual Fall 
Carnival, to the Pioneer Day celebration, weddings to memorial services, volleyball practice to championship basketball games
, Sierra Hills
 
School is truly the heart of Meadow Vista in both body and spirit.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountabi
lity Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Ac
countability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in 
the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, s

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textb
ooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Placer Hills Union Elementary held a public hearing on September 11, 2019, and determined that each school within the distric
t had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, or sci
ence lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, 
including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the
 
classroom and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the Californi
a Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the S
tate are reviewed by all teachers and 
a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommende
d materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. Th
e table displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, 
currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Sierra Hills School was originally constructed in 1995 and is comprised of 18 permanent
 
classrooms, five portable classrooms, one multipurpose room, 
one library, one staff lounge, one computer lab, and three playgrounds.  The community is very proud of the beautiful school 
setting and all stakeholders 
work diligently together to maintain the
 
school's new look.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of one full time and one part time person to ensure that the cleaning of t
he school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school  The district's governing boar
d has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed
 
in a timely manner.  A 
work order proces
s is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority are given to emergency repairs.  While reviewing this report, plea
se note that 
even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district no longer r
eceives funding from the state for deferred maintenance.  All deferred maintenance projects must therefore be funded out of 
general unrestricted funds.  Deferred maintenance projects typically include roofing, plumbing, HVAC, electrical systems, int
erior a
nd exterior painting, 
and floor systems.

to this professional development, teacher 
grade level and subject matter meetings are held to work on instructional strategies, assessment, and implementation of stand
