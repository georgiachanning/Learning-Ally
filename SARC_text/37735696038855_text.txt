School Description
 
At Libby Elementary School we are very proud of our recent accomplishments. Our students 
continue to show consistent academic progress in the SBAC in both in English/Language Arts and 
Mathematics. Our staff, parents, and students are very excited about the
 
positive changes and 
refinements in our instructional practices and school culture. Parents and community members are 
an important part of our academic program. We welcome parent participation in our school 
activities and encourage you to join our Parent 
Teacher Organization (PTO) and School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
Students at Libby will continue to develop their literacy skills in both reading and writing.  This 
coming school year will be filled with academic rigor, excellence and growth opportunities for our 
students using our newly adopted materials in K
-
5, Go Mat
h and for Language Arts, Benchmark 
Universe.  We will also use iReady as a diagnostic tool to measure student academic growth in 
reading and math. Student will be assessed three times per year to measure growth. We will 
continue our focus on Early Literacy
, Reading Comprehension and student expression. Students are 
challenged to express their ideas verbally and in writing.  Every student in Kinder
-
5th grade will 
have access to an iPad, Chromebook and a desktop computer to incorporate technological learning 
tools to support their learning.   Our entire staff looks forward in working with you and your children 
on another year of academic success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Pl
an (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For
 
more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF
 
web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

School Safety Plan
 
School safety is a top priority at Libby Elementary. The importance of school safety is especially true when it comes to stud
ents on campus. Our campus 
remains close during the hours of 8:55
-
3:35pm.  All visitors must check in the office prior to entering 
campus. All visitors must provide identification and 

ency disaster drills and lock
-
down drills. The District's Student Services and
 
Oceanside Police Department conduct unannounced lock
-
down drills during the school year to practice 
appropriate student and staff response to emergency situations. District maintenance and custodial staff inspect and repair o
ur playground equipment 
regula
rly.  We have a school
-
wide Crisis Response Plan that was developed in partnership with the Oceanside Police Department that is updated annually. 
Each year we survey parents, students, and staff about safety issues at our school. We also use results from t
his survey and from the California Healthy 
Kids Survey to identify ways we can further support our students and staff.

prehension are very important for our student's literacy development. Professional learning and 
development is very important for our teaching staff. Our staff meetings are dedicated to foster positive relationships among
 
staff and provide 
opportunities fo
r staff to model restorative practice activities.   Teachers participate in professional learning through Professional Learni
ng Communities 
during our minimum days twice a month. In addition, administration meets with grade level teams three times per year
  
to review, discuss and analyze 
student academic progress based on iReady diagnostics.   Teachers engaged in conversations with site principal and assistant 
principal through informal 
and formal classroom observations to support all student learning.
