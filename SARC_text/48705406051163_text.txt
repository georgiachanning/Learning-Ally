school
 
that
 
is
 
located
 
in
 
central
 
Fairfield
 
just

the

area.
 
Built
 
in
 
1954,
 
Fairview
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
oldest
 
schools
 
in
 
Fairfield.
 
Student

is
 
approximately
 
590
 
students.

two
 
transitional
 
kindergarten
 
classes,
 
and

Learning).
 
The

Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
The
 
Fairfield-Suisun
 
Unified
 
School
 
District
 
requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each
 
school:
 
BP/AR
 
0450,
 
Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan;
 
BP3515,
 
Campus
 
Security;
 
BP/AR
 
3515.2,
 
Disruptions;
 
and
 
BP/AR
 
3516,
 
Disaster
 
Regulations.
 
The
 
Governing
 
Board
 
insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors
 
unique
 
to
 
each
 
site.
 
A
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
plan
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
The
 
plan
 
is
 
updated
 
annually,
 
and
 
was
 
reviewed
 
in
 
September
 
2019
 
during
 
a
 
faculty
 
meeting.
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plans
 
include
 
the
 
following
 
elements:
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
climate
 
promoting
 
respect
 
for
 
diversity,
 
personal
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
effective
 
interpersonal
 
and
 
communication
 
skills,
 
anger
 
management
 
and
 
conflict
 
resolution;
 
disciplinary
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures;
 
prevention
 
of
 
and
 
alternatives
 
to
 
violence;
 
parent
 
involvement
 
strategies;
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
sale
 
or
 
use
 
of
 
alcohol
 
and
 
drugs;
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
physical
 
environment
 
and
 
development
 
of
 
ground
 
security;
 
school-site
 
crisis
 
intervention
 
strategies;
 
staff
 
training
 
in
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
techniques.
 
The
 
Fairview
 
Safety
 
Committee
 
revised
 
its
 
safety
 
plan
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
campus
 
evacuation
 
plan
 
(to
 
Fairfield
 
Civic
 
Center
 
and
 
Dutch
 
Brothers
 
parking
 
lot)
 
that
 
includes
 
directions
 
for
 
teachers
 
to
 
follow
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
an
 
active
 
shooter
 
on
 
campus.
 
The
 
school
 
conducts
 
regular
 
fire,
 
earthquake,
 
and
 
lock-
down/evacuation
 
drills
 
on
 
a
 
monthly
 
basis.
 
The
 
School

During

to

instructional
 
strategies
 
in
 
both
 
the

and
 
ELA
 
adoptions,
 
with
 
the
 
primary
 
focus
 
being
 
on
 
the
 
newer
 
ELA
 
adoption
 
(BenchmarkAdvance).
 
The
 
decision
 
to
 
place
 
emphasis
 
on
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
and
 
systemic
 
implementation
 
was
 
supported
 
by
 
declining
 
school-wide

results.
 
 
The
 
continuing
 
staff
 
development
 
occurs
 
across
 
multiple
 
platforms.
 
At
 
the
 
district
 
level,
  
staff
 
development
 
has
 
been
 
provided
 
through
 
a
 
mandated
 
training
 
series
 
in
 
ELA
 
and
 
optional
 
monthly
 
math
 
trainings.
  
Faculty
 
members
 
have
 
begun
 
the
 
two
 
previous
 
school
 
years
 
with
 
additional
 
ELA
 
training
 
to
 
support
 
successful
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
adoption.
 
The
 
district
 
further
 
provided
 
support
 
through
 
ongoing
 
professional
 
learning
 
cohorts
 
in
 
which
 
the
 
Fairview
 
staff
 
were
 
able
 
to
 
participate.
  
Specifically
 
through
 
the
 
ELD
 
cohorts,
 
teachers
 
received
 
in-class
 
coaching
 
support.
 
 
At
 
the
 
school
 
site,
 
the
 
administrative
 
team
 
provided
 
coaching
 
through
 
instructional
 
visits
 
and
 
feedback,
 
data
 
conferences,
 
planned

collaboration
 
activities,
