School Description
 
DeLaveaga
 
Elementary School is located on the east side of Santa Cruz near DeLaveaga City Park. 
The highly skilled teaching staff has many years of professional experience. We celebrate a diverse 

e fostered and valued. We 
support a strong, standards
-
based educational program supplemented by the arts and science, 
which enables all children to reach their potential.
 
 
DeLaveaga hosts a K

5 Spanish Two Way Immersion program (Dos Alas). This academicall
y rigorous 
program supports all students in achieving high levels of bilingual proficiency and literacy. Students 
in our program develop the language skills and cultural competence necessary to fully engage in 
the local community and in the greater multicu
ltural world.
 
 
DeLaveaga uses Eureka Math, a curriculum that is well aligned with the Common Core State 
Standards. In addition to our continued implementation of a school
-
wide research
-
based Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) program, we ha
ve introduced students to our new WITS 
program which assists students in solving both behavioral and academic issues. We are also 
focusing our social
-
emotional work on increasing student and staff optimism and promoting a 
growth mindset! While continuing t
o implement Walk To Read, a school
-
wide reading program that 
supports students with targeted intervention and enrichment opportunities, we piloted 3 different 
ELA programs. At the end of the year, Benchmark Workshop was adopted by the district for use at 
a
ll elementary schools. Because we have expanded our technology capacity, our students are 
accessing web
-
based support and reinforcement using our Google Chromebooks.
 
 
Major Achievements
 
DeLaveaga students consistently score well on state
-
level testing. Stu
dent scores in English 
Language Arts and Mathematics are at or above the state average. Our school has also received the 
Gold Ribbon Award from the State of California Department of Education for our Response to 
Intervention Program that supports students 
in both English and Spanish.
 
 

support classroom learning. The PTC provides additional music/dance instruction for kindergarten 
through third grade as well as stip
ends for our teachers to facilitate a student council. All students 
receive weekly art instruction funded by a district parcel tax. Students in third through fifth grade 

 
 
The Biliteracy Award
, which recognizes language proficiency in both Spanish and English, is 
awarded to a number of our 5th graders each year.
 
 
Focus for Improvement
 

helps identif
y which students require additional services during the school day or after school 
(Homework and Intervention Support). English Learners received extra support toward developing 
proficiency in reading, writing, listening and speaking (LISTOS program).
 
 
Stu
dents in grades three through five also take the State SBAC test. This assessment provides a 
statewide measure of school progress. DeLaveaga students consistently perform well on state 
standardized tests and on local measures of student achievement.

. Grade 
level teams meet regularly (up to once a week) to analyze student data  and make recommendations for best practices that are 
aligned 
with the district goals for student achievement. The School Site Council (SSC), Parent Teacher Club, and our English Langua

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to pub
lish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepar
e a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consisten
t with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information a
bout the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school princip
al or the 
district office.

(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the Sma
rter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

DeLaveaga parents are very involved as volunteers in classroom activities and field trips. Our School Site Council approves t

budget. Parents also participate on the English Learner Advisory
 
Committee, which supports our English Learners, and the Parent Teacher Club which 
helps plan for different enrichment and intervention opportunities for our students and provides funding. We are currently re
visiting our School Vision 
and Values, and hope 
to have them completed by the fall of 2020.  All of these stakeholder groups are involved in this important process.

School Safety Plan
 
Accident rates on campus are very low. The staff works together to ensure that the site is safe, clean, and orderly. We hold 
monthly safety meetings, and 
provide safety information at our staff meetings. In addition, we work with our School Resource Office
r to train staff on safety procedures, such as 
lockdown and evacuation drills. All gates are locked during the school day, and all visitors are expected to check in/sign
-
in with the office and wear a 
name tag while on campus.
 
 
With the direction of our Sch
ool Safety Committee and input from all parent groups, the Comprehensive Safe School Plan is revised annually. In March 
of 2018, the School Site Council approved our current Safe School Plan, which includes emergency procedures. In addition, key
 
members of
 
the Safety 
Committee, and Incident Command Team attend annual district
-
wide training in Emergency Response Guidelines and Disaster Procedures.
 
 
Key elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan are:
 
* Goals for creating a Creating a Caring and 
Connected Community, and a place where All Students and Staff Safe
 
* DeLaveaga staff and students understand and consistently follow the school
-
wide behavioral expectations in the classroom as outlined in PBIS 
-
 
"The 
Dragon Way."
 
* Implement and monitor th
e PBIS behavior expectations and consequences with staff, students, and parents to support more engagement and safe 
interactions on the playground at recess and lunch.
 
* Disaster Procedures and Emergency Response Guidelines
 
* Established Incident Command S
ystem
 
 
The full Comprehensive School Safety Plan can be viewed on the school and SCCS District Websites.

Types of Services Funded
 
Our school uses specialized funding to provide extra instruction for students with specific needs. We use state and federal f
unds to provide additional 
reading support for students (SIPPS, Lexia, IStation). Revenue from the local parcel tax funds teachers 
for our art and music programs. Our generous 
parent community also provides funding for learning assistants, music and dance teachers, a Garden Coordinator, and after sch
ool enrichment classes.
 
 
We also fund Learning Assistants that support our school
-
wide
 
Walk To Read (WTR) program, where students are grouped by reading levels and provided 
targeted instruction at their level.
