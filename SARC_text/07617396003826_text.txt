By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
We seek to maintain a safe, functional, and inspirational le
arning environment that promotes respect and pride, including 
a safe pickup and drop off area, visually pleasing external tile walls, murals, decorated galvanized garbage cans, and 
beautiful gardens. The entire school facility is alarmed and all classrooms
 
are air conditioned. Our facilities consist of a 
main office adjoining the principal's office, workroom, counseling office and nurse station. Two kindergarten classrooms, 
21 regular classrooms, two special day classrooms, multipurpose room, library, compu
ter lab, EL and Family Resource 
Center, Learning Center, and science room complete the campus. The outdoor facilities consist of a large blacktop, 
playground that has two lined playing fields, one kickball/baseball field, lined hopscotch, four squares and 
jump rope 
stations, and play structure. Construction of an outdoor amphitheater was completed in 2009, on the JME campus.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Par

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We believe a cornerstone of a 
quality education is a positive collaboration between parents, educators, and our students. 
John Muir Elementary is very fortunate to have a highly involved parent community. Parents are actively encouraged to 
be involved in school activities including but
 
not limited to coffee with the principal, volunteering in the classrooms, 
chaperoning field trips, assisting with picture day, book fairs, health screens, and special projects. Parents also serve on 
many school and district committees including School Sit
e Council and the English Language Advisory Committee. They 
are active partners in our school community.
 
 
The John Muir Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA) has a primary goal to encourage family involvement in the school 
community. Our actively involved PTA p
rovides many enrichment opportunities which include field trips, school

The JME Comprehensive School Safety Plan was finalized and passed by the SSC in the Fall of 2018. The Standard Response 
Protocol, adopted by the 
District in the Spring of 2012, has been communicated to both the SSC and the JME staff. The 
JME Comprehensive School Safety Plan is reviewed annually and approved by the SSC.
 
 
All staff have been trained in the SRP. Each month JME participates in a safety
 
drill, which includes: Fire, Shelter

down. A two
-
sided two page Emergency Safety Plan was developed and distributed to each staff 
member to keep on a designated safety clipboard in a conspicuous location in each classroom, with 
current student 
information and contacts. Emergency Drill Procedures and disaster plans, emergency food rations, supplies, and 
communication systems are in every work space and classroom.

Martinez Unified professional development focus for the past eight years has been to transform classroom practice to 
meet the demands of college and career readiness. Content emphasis has been on the 
implementation of the Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS), the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and the use of technology to transform and 
enhance instruction. Though each individual school site varies in its particular needs around these areas, as
 
a district the 
vision for Professional Development is consistent among all schools. As the focus has shifted from the transition to the 
CCSS to the implementation of the instructional rigor needed to fully address the standards, Professional Learning has 
had 
to shift as well. In the past few years, MUSD has emphasized the changes required of educators around key focus areas: 
mindset, intentionality, instruction, and access.
 
 
Professional Development is formally provided to all teachers two full
-
days a year
; one day in August and one in January. 
In addition to the full
-
day training provided, three half
-
day PD release times are provided to our teaching staff. This year 
these release times have been focused on Writing Calibration across all elementary sites. W
e have also provided time to 
train teachers in our new IXL online skill
-
building platform. This supplemental program provides Tier I differentiated 
support and a customized learning plan for all K
-
5 students. Additional opportunities for individual and gra
de
-
level specific 
professional development in other content areas, i.e. EL learners, math, Universal Design for Learning, etc. are also 
provided based on teacher needs and site requests.
 
 
Beginning in 2017
-
18, and continuing through and into 2019
-
20, profe
ssional development at the elementary level has 
been focused on the implementation and extension (with the recent addition of a K
-
2 Phonics Program) of Readers and 
Writer's Workshop.  To support implementation and student learning, MUSD has brought in cons
ultants who are expertly 

in varying ways over the past three years. Each year professional development has been designed to support teac
her and 
student growth, as well as rigor within this program. Training includes "demo days" where the coaches plan and model 
instruction with teachers and then, in turn, teachers practice in front of the coaches.  The coaches have also spent time 
with prin
cipals discussing the elements of the workshop model, what to look for when conducting classroom observations, 
and how to give feedback to teachers within the workshop.  This has built the capacity of our teachers and principals to 
sustain the implementati
on of high
-
quality instruction within our Balanced Literacy block.  In addition, the coaches work 
with Reading and Writing Support Teachers from each site to provide additional training.  The Support Teachers (primary 
and upper elementary teachers from eac
h site, up to four teachers per site) meet five times a year with the coaches, as 
well as provide training and support for colleagues at their respective school sites via staff meetings, grade
-
level training, 
and 1:1 support.
 
 
 
In addition, JME has made Ch
aracter Counts! character education program a priority for all students on campus. Extensive 
training has been provided to staff to ensure the program is implemented with fidelity.
