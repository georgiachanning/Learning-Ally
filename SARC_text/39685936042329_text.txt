By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Golden 
West Elementary school was established in 1961. It is located in central Manteca.  It is home to the Golden West 
49ers and 49er Pride. We are loud and proud and especially, as we share our school mantra: Pride in Yourself; Pride in 
Your School; Pride in Ev
erything You Do!  We serve over five hundred students from our neighborhood families in grades 
Kindergarten through Eighth Grade, as well as hosting Pre
-
School and Transitional Kindergarten classes.  We have a faculty 
that is committed to meeting  behavior
al, health, social
-
emotional, and academic needs of our students. Each teacher is 
qualified to provide differentiated instruction to meet the diverse needs of our students. You will find instructional 
strategies that are research
-
based and targeted to the 
Common Core State Standards. Students have opportunities to 
connect with books, write to their grade level genres, and apply their mathematical knowledge.
 
 
Golden West's Mission is to ensure individual student growth toward mastery of state standards, prom
ote nutritional and 
social
-
emotional well
-
being for each of our students in an engaging, and safe learning environment. We are committed to 
using data to identify student needs; to inform decisions and to monitor and evaluate progress toward our goals.
 
Gol
den West plan includes three goals to address student performance.
 
 
Goal 1:  Students will have equitable access to core curriculum to facilitate students meeting and/or exceeding grade level 
standards. EffectiveTier1 instruction will be implemented along 
with Tier 2 Interventions to increase the number of 
students meeting grade level standards. This goal aligns with MUSD's goal to maximize student achievement by supporting 
effective instruction aligned to state standards.
 
 
Goals 2 is to Increase the days a
ll students are in attendance at school by reducing chronic absenteeism and suspensions 
for all students through implementation of PBIS, which includes interventions and supports to create a positive, safe 
learning environment in which students attend, inc
reasing their opportunity to make progress toward state standards. 
This goal aligns with MUSD's goal to provide a safe, healthful, and expansive environment.
 
 
Goal 3 is to provide students with educational experiences; cultural experiences; career and coll
ege experiences, academic 
& extracurricular experiences; and Social
-
emotional learning skills to promote school attendance, school connectedness; 
engagement; and to acquire background knowledge and understanding of state standards. This goal aligns with MU
SD's 
goal to promote engaging learning opportunities for all students, inclusive of emerging students, inside and outside the 
classroom

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The District takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the Dis
trict 
uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.
 
The results of this survey are available at the District Office. Below is more specific information on the condition of the 
school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of S
chool Buildings
 
Golden West School was completed in 1964. The administration building was finished in 1961 along with a library, multi
-
purpose room, and several classrooms. Portable classrooms have been added. In the year 2000, the community 
gymnasium was 
built at Golden West as a result of a partnership with the City of Manteca. In 2015, the campus was 
modernized. This modernization built a new administration/classroom building, a new kitchen, converted existing 
administration space to new classrooms and r
emoved several portable classrooms. After modernization the campus has 
38 classrooms.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that repairs necessary to keep schools in good working order are completed in a timely 
manner. A work order pro
cess is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

is ava
ilable at the school office and at the District Office. Staff works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The District allocates funding for deferred 
maintenance. The Deferred Maintenance Program includes funding for 
replacement of existing school building components so that the educational process may safely continue. Typically, this 
includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical sys

2019
-
2020 budget allocated $640,000 to address deferred maintenance needs throughout the district.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
The District is currently planning to renovate and modernize its schools base

plan. As part of that activity there are projects planned at the campus which will be completed through the use of local 
funds. State funding will also be sought for those projects which may be eligible for modern
ization funding. Modernization 
of the existing campus was completed in 2017.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019

All school sites in the Manteca Unified School District annually update the Disaster Plan and School Safety Plan. The plan 
was revised by Safe Schools Consultants and Site Administration according to the required adoption process with 
appropriate School Si
te Council public hearings and School Safety Planning Committee input. Teachers and staff annually 
receive training on disaster procedures. Teachers and staff received ongoing training throughout the 2019
-
2020 school 
year in order to meet the appropriate g
uidelines established by the state. The safety plans are confirmed and approved 
by March 1, 2020.
 
 
Manteca Unified School District continues to make strides in the improvement of the educational climate and reduced 


students and the security of campuses are high priorities in MUSD. School personnel and students participate in monthly 
disaster preparedness drills including specific proced
ures for fire, earthquake, flood, civil disturbance, and hazardous 
chemical situations. The school sites also focus on establishing goals that are needed.
 
 
The District has established procedures for submitting complaints against personnel and programs.  A
n information 

Also, 
a nondiscrimination/harassment report form is used to help staff in reporting and tracking data.
 
 
Our schools w

addition, authorized prevention activities include conflict resolution strategies, before and after school programs, and 
district
-
wide efforts to preve
nt illegal gang activities with Drug Free and Tobacco Free School Zones clearly established 
and posted. Our District seeks grants and utilizes the Health Services Department to meet the health and counseling needs 
of students.
