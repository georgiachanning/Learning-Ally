Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school us
es 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessa
ry to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the cust
odial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The purpose of the School Site Safety Plan is to provide a unified template for school sites to respond and recover from 
an emergency, disaster, or
 
event resulting in the disruption of normal school operations.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan guides a coordinated school staff response to an emergency, disaster, or event and aids in 
directing emergency response activities toward reaching an agreed
-
upon g
oal. School Site Safety Plan procedures are 
scalable in order to address incidents that may develop over time and those that may occur without warning.

Quality instruction and instructional leadership are at the heart of the district's achievement efforts. To ensure this, the 
Educational Services Department engages teachers, administrators, and other personnel in ongoing professional 
development focused o
n improving teaching and learning. Training is provided to principals and other administrators to 
improve their ability to provide strong instructional leadership and guide teaching and learning at school sites. The 
principals, in turn, provide support to 
teachers through staff conferences, opportunities for collaborative study and 
planning, and individual coaching based on ongoing classroom observations. Teachers and other staff are provided with 
both on and off
-
site professional development in all standar
ds
-
based curriculum content areas. Beyond the content areas, 
professional development is provided in English Language Development, differentiated instruction, and educational 
technology. In addition, training is made available in classroom management and t
he effective use of assessment data and 
teacher data teams in meeting the needs of all students. A primary goal of the professional development program is 
ensuring that all students are served by skilled, highly qualified teachers and that teachers are sup
ported by strong, 
knowledgeable instructional leaders. Teachers are informed of the various opportunities for professional development 
and encouraged to attend.
 
 
Additionally, at Sheldon we strive to cultivate a collaborative teacher community where teache
rs are supported with 
professional development for planning for and implementing high
-
quality instructional techniques that creates purposeful 
learning inside the classroom, receiving on
-
going feedback and coaching from peers and administrator, and opportu
nities 
to engage themselves and students in data
-
driven instruction and learning.
 
 

Writing workshop focus. Teachers collaborate on a regul
ar basis and discuss their teaching techniques. They also meet to 
review testing and develop pacing in both ELA and Math.
