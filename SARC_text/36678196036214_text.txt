By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
School through Fifth. T here are 35 classroom spaces, including 17 portable 
classroom buildings added between 1986 and 2009, and a multi
-
purpose room completed early 2008. One of the

pport staff, including instructional coaches. An additional building 
houses the district pre
-
school speech and language program called T he Let's Talk Program. The total school site sits on 
10.2 acres. Playground space for students comprises approximately 
7 acres. T here are 13 student and 5 adult restrooms,

1995. T he general condition of the facility is good. New HVAC units w ere installed in 2010 in 13 of th
e portable classrooms, 
to provide more efficient and quieter air conditions. New HVAC units w ere installed 2017 in 19 of original classrooms to

Maint
enance and Repair
 
Del Norte School is maintained in a manner that ensures it is functional and in good repair. T he school employs two full
-
time and one half
-
time custodians. The school administrators work with the custodial staff to make certain that 
clas
srooms, restrooms and the school grounds remain clean, safe and orderly, and that the floors, walls and plumbing 
system are all in good repair. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given 
the highest priori
ty. To assist in this effort, the district Operations Department annually conducts an in
-
depth evaluation 
of each school to determine the condition of the facilities and to identify situations that need maintenance, repair or an 
upgrade. The district uses 
a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction to assess the data gathering during the inspections. All findings are shared with the principal, and work orders
 
for needed repairs are created at that t
ime. The results of this survey are available in the school office or the district office. 
According to the Williams Visit that took place on August 31, 2018, Del Norte's audit w as a positive, professional 
experience with the focus by the entire staff on 
seeking to improve the learning of each student. Del Norte had no 
insufficiencies observed for Instructional Materials. The overall rating for Del Norte was Exemplary. T he report on this 
inspection w as forwarded to the Superintendent of Schools. T here w
 
ere no areas of concern noted by the team.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

grade students who are two or 
more years below grade level participate in the r
eading intervention program, the iLiT program, as w ell as differentiated 
mathematics instruction. Extended learning opportunities are offered throughout the year, to provide support after the 
bell rings each school day. In addition, intervention opportuni
ties are offered in a small group setting throughout the 
instructional day based on students' academic needs.
 
 
Various extended education programs have been offered before and after school to meet the needs of these students. 
Instructional decisions are ba
sed on data derived from Benchmark, Interim Assessments, Formative assessments and 
grade level common assessment test results along with Unit Assessments. The school year is launched with deliberate 
decisions taken from an intensive review of academic data
 
from the California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress (CAASPP). In addition, categorical funds support an Outreach Assistant and Instructional Coach to coordinate all 
assessments and interventions for all student subgroups and to further supp
ort classroom teachers in the development 
and delivery of best practices for all students. Additionally, they assist and train teachers in data analysis and effective 
instructional strategies.

Staff development is based on district initiatives and individual school and teacher needs. Student performance data, 
teacher surveys, and principal observations help determine professional needs. On
-
site training and 
support have been 
provided in the focus areas of Technology, Wonders ELA Program, Wonders ELD (English Language Development), 
Embedded and Integrated ELD, Eureka Math, Multi
-
Tier Support Systems, Kagan Cooperative Learning, Planning Rigorous 
Lessons, Deepe
ning understanding of Cooperative Learning versus Collaborative Learning, and NGSS training for teachers. 
Our school has worked to deepen knowledge of Eureka Math to strengthen lesson delivery and teachers attended several 
math study workshops. Teachers al
so work in grade level collaboration meetings to analyze student data, create high 
leverage activities, and plan deliberate decisions to increase student achievement. We work together to enhance our 
rigorous Language Arts Common Core standards and are digg
ing deeper into a new adoption that meets our students' 
needs. Additionally, teachers w ere provided time for structured teacher planning time for the purpose of analyzing 
student data and sharing effective teaching strategies. Teachers collaborate to crea
te and promote rigorous and engaging 
lessons with tools that are research
-
based.
 
 
The support for teachers at Del Norte Elementary has come from the Principal, Elementary Administrator, a full
-
time 
Instructional Coach, and Outreach Assistant. They 
provide assistance to teachers by offering instructional support, support 
with data analysis and staff development in English Language Development, Language Arts, and interventions for at
-
risk, 
and mathematics. They meet with teachers to plan, conduct coac
hing cycles, share engagement strategies, look at data 
and plan for differentiated instruction based on needs. They also provide a number of technology resources and other 
instructional materials to support instruction and student learning. Finally, Del No

Administrator serve as the instructional leaders, by planning meetings, presenting researching effective techniques, 
conducting classroom walk
-
throughs, and embracing the district goals.
 
 
Del Norte provides many opportunities
 
for teacher collaboration by grade level. The first and third Tuesdays of the month 
are dedicated days for grade level training and meetings where teachers discuss strategies, curriculum and generate 
questions or concerns for the support staff. In additio
n, Del Norte has hired an instructional coach to work with grade 
levels to plan to share engagement strategies, to look at data and to alter instruction based on data and student targets. 
During Data meetings, teachers analyze benchmark data, plan teaching
 
activities and collaborate on new instructional 
strategies during this process. Towards the end of the school year, horizontal and vertical articulation of grade level 
standards helps teachers formulate deliberate decisions to implement in the classroom. 
Our teachers pride themselves in 
designing rigorous lessons to promote Common Core.
