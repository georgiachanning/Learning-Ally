About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Clovis Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the
 

CUSD Board Policy Number 3301 estab
lishes criteria and procedures for the adoption of all textbooks. All K
-
8 textbooks purchased have been approved 
by the State Board of Education and adopted by the Clovis Unified Governing Board. Textbooks and instructional materials purc
hased for grades 9

aligned to the state content standards and adopted by the Clovis Unified Governing Board.
 
 
The Department of Supplemental Services continues to support the school sites with funding that allows for the purchase of su
pplementary instructional 
materi
al for our students, including English learners in grades K
-
12. The supplemental material is designed to accelerate pupils as rapidly as possible 
toward grade
-
level proficiency in the core subjects of English
-
language arts, math, social science and science
. These supplemental materials are used in 
addition to the basic reading/language arts and other core materials provided for every student and are correlated to state c
ontent standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
On June 5, 2012, voters within Clovis Unified School District approved Measure A. It is a $298 million school bond measure th
at allows CUSD to upgrade 
outdated schools and classrooms, improve out
-
dated HVAC systems, repair leaky roofs and plumbing, improve
 
technology access to equip students for 
the 21st century economy, increase access to vocational and career technical education, improve security
-
camera systems to enhance school safety, 
acquire a new school site, complete new school construction and more.
 
Every school in the district benefits from Measure A projects. The improvements 
at Century in the areas listed above were completed in September 2016.
 
 
Century Elementary is 20 years old. The campus opened in the 2000
-
01 school year. We provide a clean, s
afe learning environment. Our custodians 
perform basic cleaning operations daily and maintain the grounds and buildings. In addition, deep cleaning is conducted two t
imes a year at each site. 
Our School Attendance Review Team (SART) committee conducts eigh
t clean
-
campus inspections each year.
 
 
This committee of parents inspects the campus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feedback to our student bod
y. When asked to grade 


removed immediately. Through increased community awareness, school pride and an open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to 
an all
-
time low.
 
 
Century Elem
entary has 31 regular classrooms, a library media center, a multi
-
purpose room, and five special education rooms. The design capacity of 
the school is 600 students. Athletic facilities include two baseball diamonds, two softball diamonds, one football fiel
d, and two soccer fields. The baseball 
fields were skinned for dirt infields.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on 
building and maintaining excellent 
facilities as eco
nomically as possible.

School Safety Plan
 
Our open yet connected campus helps teachers work 
together as a team. Century has a School Safety Plan and a School Crisis Intervention Plan on file 
and available to all parents as well as the general public. Staff and parents review and update the school plans annually. Mo
st recently, the School Safety 
P
lan was updated and discussed with school staff in November of 2019, and the School Site Council in December. The staff, with
 
input from parents and 
community members, develops both plans to help ensure a safe and nonviolent environment for all students. S
pecific areas of focus, coupled with 
appropriate strategies to address concerns are featured in our school plan.

Professional development is ongoing to ensure that the Century staff keeps abreast of new learning strategies, innovative tea
ching techniques and 
applied technology in the field of education. A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordi
nate and plan les
-
sons or units as an entire

An effective process for staff development and curriculum improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrato
rs. Topics relevant to 
the needs and priorities of the school are identi
fied early in the year, and monthly staff
-
development sessions are scheduled accordingly. It should also 
be pointed out that CUSD offers a New Teacher Training Academy for beginning teachers. This is a two
-
year program targeted at five performance areas.
 
 
Teachers also meet as a grade
-
level team each week to look at student needs and discuss ways they can support each other to meet those needs.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instr
uction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and culturally relevant understanding.
 
 
In the 2018
-
19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days 
for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional 
development opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also 
offered throughout the school year.
 
 
One hund
red mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and district
-
sponsored training that 
included:  curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional 
practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to

Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-

assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
 
 
Categorical Program Descriptions
