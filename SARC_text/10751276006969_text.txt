School Description
 
McCabe Elementary School is one of 7 schools within the Mendota Unified School District, a rural 
area located 40 miles 
west of Fresno. According to CBEDS information taken in October 2018, 
student enrollment for the 2019
-
2020 school year totals 927 students in grades 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
The student population is made up of approximately 98% Hispanic students and 2% other. P
overty 
is apparent in the agriculture
-
based community, where 97% of the students qualify for the Free or 
Reduced Lunch Program. The English learner population makes up 69% of the total student 
population. Migrant students make up 8% of the total student po
pulation.
 
 
The McCabe Elementary program builds upon its strengths. The teaching staff is stable with 
minimal turnover in the past fifteen years.
 
 
The district and site administration are dedicated in providing the necessary forum, time, and 
structure to a
llow for staff development, workshops, and curriculum planning. Teachers at McCabe 
Elementary are currently CLAD or BCLAD certified. Our staff is also involved in ongoing professional 
development through the Fresno County Office of Education, Bridges to Le
adership Program, T4 
Lesson Delivery Training, Kagan Structures, the Teacher Induction Program, Guided Reading 
Strategies, and SWUN Math strategies and other district developed professional development.  
Additionally, we have a leadership team that is comp
osed of teachers and administration that is a 
key component in the decision
-
making process. Our paraprofessionals are also committed to 
continuing their education.
 
 
The majority of our student data is recorded using Illuminate which serves as an ongoing ev
aluation 
tool of student progress. The staff uses classroom data to follow the progress of each student, to 
provide focused Response to Intervention instruction, and to develop differentiated curriculum and 
instruction delivery for our students.
 
 
Our one t
o one chrome
-
book student computers are internet ready which provide access to our 
Accelerated Reader and Math Programs, the Jiji math program, benchmark assessments, Common 
Formative Assessments, and Smarter Balanced Assessment Component. Additionally, ev
ery 
classroom is equipped with SMART Technology or Promethean Boards, which includes a document 
camera, an infrared sound system, and a microphone. We have also added the program Imagine 
Learning, which targets our Migrant, students in our Intensive groups
, and EL population.
 
 
On a regular school day, students in 4th 

 
6th grade are afforded a 345 instructional minute day, 
3rd grade is afforded a 335
-
minute day, and 2nd grade is afforded a 325 instructional minute day.  
Several minimum days have been schedu
led throughout the 2018
-
2019 school year for Professional 
Development, which include but are not limited to English Language Development, technology, 
instructional strategies and methods, test

um
 
 
McCabe Elementary School will build upon student individual strengths while addressing challenges 
by providing the highest quality education. We are dedicated to reaching all students through data 
driven collaboration and reflective instruction. We pro
vide opportunities for students to succeed, 
evaluate, and build problem solving skills that will prepare them for their future.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the 
school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Our parents are invited to attend School Site Council Meetings, English Language Advisory Council Meetings, to participate in
 
Parent Nights, workshops 
from F
COE, workshops for PIQE (Parent Institute for Quality Education, Parent Teacher Conferences, Coffee Chats, be aware of and he

and visit our school site. All parents are also invited to participate in free ESL classes held here at our site,
 
and are encouraged to go to visit their child's 
classroom to talk to teachers on scheduled visits.  Parents also attend movie nights at McCabe and Paint Nights.  The last tw
o years we have added Family 
Fun Paint Nights.  During this time McCabe Admin shar
es information that they have been trying to get out to parents.
 
 
There is continuous information shared with parents via BlackboardConnect, our monthly school calendars, the school new elect
ronic marquee, our 
school website, and teacher calls.  Our Parent
 
Involvement Policy is updated yearly (last update October 2019).  Our Home School Compact is provided 
to parents every year and is signed by all participants.  All students have a PowerSchool log
-
in that is used to keep parents informed of their students'
 
academic progress via the PowerSchool student information system.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The School Safety Plan is revised on an annual basis. Included in our safety plan is an emergency organization plan for our s
ite and a phone tree of all site 
staff members. Vice Principal is in 
charge of getting the Emergency Plan laid out and ready to go.  The Emergency Organization Plan outlines duties for 
all staff members in the case of an emergency and/or disaster. The following teams are formed: Emergency Operation Center Tea
