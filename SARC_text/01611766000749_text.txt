School Description
 
Welcome to Mission Valley Elementary School.  Mission Valley Elementary has earned the honor 
of being named a California Distinguished School in 2018.  Our vision is to unite parents, educators, 
and th
e community to motivate and prepare students to be lifelong learners and responsible 
citizens.  We have created a positive, child
-
centered learning environment for all students through 
the cooperative efforts of parents, staff, students, and community memb
ers.  New this year is an 
FUSD counselor and a Youth and Family Services counselor on campus two days a week to support 
all students.
 
 
Our diverse student population of 620 is approximately 85 percent Asian, 8 percent white, 4 
percent Hispanic, 1 
percent African
-
American, and 2 percent multiple or not known. Nine percent 
of our students are English Learners.  Throughout the year, many cultural events are celebrated in 
the classrooms and with our school community.
 
 
The partnership we share with our 
parents and community enhances the learning experiences of 
both students and staff.  Our Mission Valley School Association (MVSA) parent group is our greatest 
supporter.  Through the annual membership drive and Jog
-
A
-
Thon fund
-
raiser, MVSA has been able 
to
 
provide technology in the classrooms, support classroom supplies, provide enrichment programs 
and support our computer lab.
 
 
In addition to the core curriculum, special programs for students include 4 Special Day Classes 
(SDC), Gifted and Talented Educati
on integration (GATE), School Site Council (SSC), English 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), lunch time intramural sports, enrichment activities, The 
Growth Mindset, student leadership opportunities, and Fine Arts Mini Education (FAME).  All of 
these prog
rams have resulted in excellent student attitudes and high student achievement.  At 
Mission Valley Elementary, we are proud of our programs and learning environment, which 
enhance self
-
esteem and student success.  This is accomplished by including students
 
in all activities 
at all grade levels.  If you wish additional information about Mission Valley Elementary, please visit

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
dist
rict office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main 
fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core classes for 
all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call f
or.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school was built in 1956.  The first renovation was in 1999 and included air
-
conditioning for all classrooms, updated wiring, six portable classrooms, 
a library portable, a new science lab, and a n
ew office building.  The 2004 renovation included a new multipurpose room, new bus circle and driveway 
configuration to improve traffic flow, additional parking area, a new track, covered walkways, and new landscaping.  During t
he summer of 2008, new 
roofs
 
on all permanent buildings and a fire alarm system were installed.  Additional underground pipes for improved drainage betwee
n the classroom 
wings were also installed.  The school received Measure E Bond money over the summer of 2018 to replace HVAC units
 
in the three main school buildings 
and fencing was added to the front of the school.
 
 
New internet and wifi systems have also been upgraded.  New LED lights are set to be installed in November 2019 throughout th
e campus.
 
 
We have one day custodian and two

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

School Safety Plan
 
Mission Valley, in partnership with MVSA, has an established Safety Patrol/Valet System.  The one teacher, the principal and 
the student safety patrol 
monitor the valet before and after 
school.   Students are allowed on the playground for ten minutes before school which is under teacher supervision.  
The before
-
school, morning, and afternoon recesses are supervised by teachers.  The principal and paid noon duty supervisors monitor the
 
caf
eteria and 
playground during the lunch periods.  Teachers and the principal regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in
 
school; encouraging students 
to show respect, make good decisions and solve problems.
 
 
Our Letter Reward Program encour
ages and monitors positive student behavior on a weekly basis with feedback to parents every Friday.  all visitors must 
sign in at the office and receive a colored badge to wear throughout their stay to ensure student and staff safety.  Staff me
mbers will 
question adults 
who do not have a badge to ensure compliance with our sign
-
in (safety)  policy.  Mission Valley incorporates the District's Anti
-
Bully Initiative in our Letter 
Reward Program.
 
 
Our Safety Committee revises the School Comprehensive Safety Pl
an annually; it was last updated on September 11, 2019.  The plan is approved yearly 
by the district and school board.  The plan includes job descriptions for each crisis leader/team, procedures for student saf
ety in an emergency, exit 
routes, inventories 
of emergency supplies, and checkout procedures.  All staff review the plan during a school
-
wide meeting at the beginning of the year.  
We practice monthly fire drills, lock down and earthquake drills.  Our student Safety Stars play an integral role in our 
drills and are trained each year by 
our physical education specialist.  Training for staff on emergency preparedness is held throughout the school year.  24 teac
hers participated in on site 
CPR/first aide training on October 17, 2016 and are able to attend
 
training throughout the year which is offered by our Risk Management Department.
 
 
The school has received an AED and trauma kits which are located in the main office.  Trauma kits are in the school office, d
ay custodian room, PE office 
and MUR.
 
 
Several s
taff members received Trauma Training in the spring of 2019.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the 
subjects they teach.  Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budg
et cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
