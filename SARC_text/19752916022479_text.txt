Washington School Mission Statement:
 
The mission of Washington Elementary School, in partnership with parents and community, is compulsory 
learning for 
all students, implemented by a standards
-
based curriculum in order to:
 

 
Ensure that every child is empowered with meaningful, lifelong skills in academic, physical, and 
social endeavors.
 

 
Provide high quality instruction.
 

 
Maintain a learning atmosphere that 
encourages honesty, kindness, mutual respect, and an 
appreciation of cultural diversity.
 

 
Welcome parent involvement and input in all areas of the school program.
 
 

 
Washington Elementary School, located in the heart of San Gabriel approx
imately ten miles east of Los 
Angeles, is representative of the diverse ethnic and economic population of Southern California. Having first 
opened our doors in 1888, Washington School is the oldest public elementary school in the San Gabriel Valley. 
We are
 
exceedingly proud of our rich historical background, of our diverse student population, of our ongoing 
educational excellence and of the exemplary, positive partnership that exists between our school and the 
community we serve.
 
 
The Washington teachers an
d staff, in partnership with our parents, is committed to providing an enriching 
educational program each day that is differentiated and designed to meet the individual needs of all students. 
With a diverse student population of 464 students in grades TK t
hrough fifth grade, our staff works diligently 
to ensure that every student learns the essential skills and standards set by the state of California. We 
consistently evaluate our effectiveness, using a variety of assessment data to guide our instructional 
decisions 
and approaches. We also identify goals and growth targets annually at the site level, by grade and by individual 
teacher. Parent and community support is an essential element supporting the success of our programs at 
Washington. We pride ourselve
s in strong home school communication with monthly newsletters, and a 
school website, all of which are regularly updated. We have an extremely active PTA and School Site Council 
that meet regularly and activity support numerous activities and programs that
 
benefit all students. We are 
proud of our accomplishments. The state recognized us as one of a small percentage of schools in the state 
that is eligible to apply for the prestigious California Distinguished School Award. In the Spring of 2004, 
Washington 
School was recognized as a California Distinguished School and also honored with the California 
Title I Achieving School Award. Washington has also been selected as a California Honor Roll School for the 
past several years. These awards come as a result of
 
the ongoing efforts of our staff and the positive 
partnership between our school and our community. Our school has Positive Behavioral Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS) to help students feel supported with our schools' behavior expectations. Teachers and 
staff 
reward students in a positive forum by "catching students being good" as students earn Way Tickets to 
"purchase" incentives and rewards. 
 
 
Extracurricular and Enrichment Activities:
 
Washington Elementary students have numerous extracurricular and enr
ichment opportunities. After school 
enrichment activities through the school include Robotics and tutoring classes. San Gabriel Community 
Services Department offers a free after school homework help and recreation program 5 days a week for 
grades 2
-
5. In a
ddition, we have several organizations that provide fee
-
based after school enrichment activities 
including Asian Youth Center, Chess Masters, and After
-
School technology/coding.
 
 
Within our School Accountability Report Card (SARC), you will find school sta
tistics, assessment data, 
significant academic growth, as well as a description of opportunities supporting success for all. We hope you 
find it to be helpful in learning more about Washington School.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing o
n September 11, 2018 and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, includin
g 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed
 
by the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee c
omposed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
