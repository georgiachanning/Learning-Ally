By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Day Creek Intermediate is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general housekeeping practices. 
Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff
 
and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urge
nt repairs, or special projects. Work orders are prepared and 
submitted to M&O through the collective efforts of the school secretary, clerk, and custodian. Emergency situations are 
given high priority and resolved immediately by site or district custodial
 
staff.
 
 
The principal and day custodian communicate daily on an informal basis to discuss campus maintenance and safety 

month to discuss main
tenance
-
related issues associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, 
upcoming events, work orders (submitted and outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meets with 
the custodian to conduct a comprehensive inspectio
n of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is 
forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and systems and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of f
acilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report identifies 
the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.
 
 
Day Creek Intermediate's custodial staff are qualified and equipped to hand
le routine cleaning needs, general 
maintenance, and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage. One full
-
time day custodian and one full
-
time afternoon custodian are resp
onsible for 

student restrooms, and cleaning the cafeteria after meals are served. Every morning before school begins, the day 
custodi
an inspects school facilities for safety hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff and 
students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed immediately.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible for tho
roughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 

irrigation systems.
 
 
Etiwanda School District participates in the State S
chool Deferred Maintenance Program which provides dollar
-
for
-
dollar 
matching funds to assist school districts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. These 
repairs typically include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditio
ning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and 
floor systems.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP]
 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight
 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant co
gnitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or program
s 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are encouraged to be
 

committees, and volunteering at the school. The staff welcomes parent assistance in the classroom and library as well as 
chaperoning field trips and school events. Ba
ck to School Night, Open House, Renaissance recognition events, student 
performances, Family Fun Nights, Family Education Nights, Halloween Bash, 8th Grade Picnic, Watch D.O.G.S., and PTSO
-
sponsored activities provide opportunities for parents to interact 
with school staff and other families in their community 

(Gifted and Talented Education), LCAP (Local Control and Accountability Plan) Ad
visory Committee, and African American 
Parent and Educator Advisory Committee (AAPEAC) enable parents to provide oversight and input on the school budget, 
activities, and educational programs. Parents who would like to get more involved or volunteer their 
time may contact 
the school office at (909) 803
-
3300.
 
 
School
-
to
-
home communication takes place in a variety of formats. Every six weeks along with grades and progress 
reports, the school issues a newsletter featuring a message from the principal, upcoming
 
events, a PTSO report, helpful 
tips for parents, and informative educational articles. The school website is a valuable resource for general information 
about the school, activities, programs, schedules, and staff.  An automated telephone system enables s
chool staff to 
quickly contact parents for urgent and important announcements and occasionally, flyers and letters are sent home for 
special announcements.   The district maintains an online mailing list for parents who wish to receive e
-
mail 
announcements
 
and messages related to Day Creek Intermediate and the district.
 
 
The formula we use to ensure academic success is everyone takes responsibility for every student.  Students monitor their 
academic progress in core classes online through their Aeries.net  
accounts and organize their homework and assignment 

accounts, weekly classroom folders that include graded work, e
-
mail, and parent
-
student
-
teacher conferences.  Teachers 
are available to meet with students and parents before, during, and after school and 100% of our teachers maintain 
TeacherWeb sites and use school e
-
mail.  Administrators are regularly in classrooms observing students at work
 
and 
offering feedback and positive comments.  Students in jeopardy of failing classes meet with their parents and teachers to 
complete an Individual Remediation Plan (IRP) which maps out student, school, and home interventions which may include 
credit rec
overy or extra support from our Student Services Assistant.
