School Description
 
Stanton Elementary is a school where students are put first in all our actions and decisions. We 
believe in working 
together, understand the importance of goal
-
setting, hold all students to high 
standards, prepare our students for the future and involve all stakeholders in our learning process 
through collaboration and open communication.
 
 
The goal of our school is to p
rovide each student with a challenging and rigorous curriculum 
appropriate to his/her academic level. We believe every child can learn and can achieve academic 
success. To this end, every child will be provided with quality, differentiated instruction and 
support 
to be a successful well
-
rounded individual.
 
 
"We can do it! Yes, we can!" 
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
 
Our mission at Stanton Elementary School is to encourage children to learn and grow in a safe, 
nurturing environment that promotes literacy, fosters sel
f
-
esteem, and challenges students to 
succeed. Each child is an individual of great worth and is entitled to develop his/her full potential. 
With parents and teachers working together as a team towards the same goal, every child will 
succeed. In order to gi
ve each the best opportunity for success, we ask that we keep children first 
in all that we do. If we accept and make real the pledge to keep children first, then it follows that 
education is our #1 priority. These two concepts as core values and a common 
cause unite a school 
community and empower it to do what is needed for educating the children. We know our Stanton 
Elementary School community is such a place.
 
 
At Stanton Elementary School, we take the business of loving and teaching children seriously. E
ach 
person at our school approaches his/her task with a keen understanding of the honor that it is able 
to touch the future through the children. As Helen Keller said, "Alone we can do so little; together 
we can do so much." Together we can, will and are c
reating a school where students come first in 
all our actions and decisions.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Stanton Elementary School is located in the town of Castro Valley, a beautiful community that is just across the bay from San
 
Francisco and just south of 
the city of Oakland.  Castro 
Valley is a growing and a richly diverse community.
 
 
Stanton Elementary School was built in 1952 and we celebrated our 50th anniversary during the 2002/2003 school year. Our scho
ol completed 18 months 
of modernization and seismic upgrade work in 2007. This
 
work included: modernized/upgrades in restrooms and cafeteria kitchen, carpet, flooring, 
electrical work, painting and earthquake safety upgrades.  This year in cooperation with the Alameda County Public Works Agen
cy, a flashing crosswalk 
and sidewalk upg
rades on Somerset Avenue were completed. In addition, a new kindergarten play structure was donated by our Stanton Parents 
Association in the 2007 

 
08 school year and our school community continues to work on our school/community garden. In 2016, voters a
pproved 
Measure G which will bring many improvements to the campus.
 
 
The campus is composed of nineteen classrooms, a computer lab, a library, multi
-
purpose room, a science center, a Resource classroom, an intervention 
classroom, and an administrative offi
ce. The school is fortunate to have a private day care facility that operates on campus before and after school. The 
custodial staff maintains clean and safe facilities. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep th
e school in go
od repair and 
working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency r
epairs are given the 
highest priority.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or 
programs of study
