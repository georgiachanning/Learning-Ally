Parent volunteers at school are
 
very active in providing educational opportunities and materials for 
our students.  We value the help and support we receive from our friends and neighbors.  Although 
we live in rural communities, our intent is to give our students the skills, knowledge,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Igo
-
Ono
-
Platina Union School District is a rural district made up of just one school, currently: Igo
-
Ono Elementary.  As with many rural schools, 
operation and maintenance resources are limited. To ensure the sch
ool is clean, safe, and functional the district helped form the New Millennium 
Partnership in 2001 with nearby Shasta Union Elementary and, the larger, Redding School District. The Redding School District
 
helps to oversee, manage, 
and assist with various a
spects of school maintenance and business services for the smaller, more rural districts.
 
 
Igo
-
Ono Elementary school is staffed with one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal works with the 
custodians to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The lead custodian also ensures that the repairs necessary to ke
ep the school 
in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process through a program called "Aki
ta Box" is used to ensure efficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs, the maintenance de
partment schedules extra 

cements.
 
 
On a monthly basis, the lead custodian uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Northern California Schools Insuran
ce to evaluate the conditions 
of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the Redding School District Facilities 
Department which then compiles an annual evaluation for the site.
 
 
Igo
-
Ono Elementary school has a beautiful campus.  Igo facilities include three buildings, of which one is portable.  There are e
ight classrooms which all 
have wireless internet access. Fou
rth through eighth
-
grade classrooms have one
-
to
-
one student Chromebooks, while kindergarten through third
-
grade 
classrooms have one
-
to
-
one student Microsoft Surface tablets.
 
 
The facilities also include a multipurpose room and a library.  The main school b
uilding re
-
roofed in 2017. A walking/jogging path runs the perimeter of 
the playfield; the play areas were recently resurfaced and the play structures modernized.  All lighting in the school was up
graded during the fall of 2016.  
In December 2016 a six

foo
t security fence was constructed around the perimeter of student areas.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Pl
an
 
Our School Safety Plan is coordinated with the overall plan for the Redding School District New Millennium Partnership.  Emer
gency information has 
been developed for the school along with maps and protocols for emergency situations. The key elements add
ressed in our School Safety Plan are in 
regards to the campus grounds, school buildings, security, and emergency procedures. Each staff member has a radio to communi
cate with each other 
and the office.  Regular fire, earthquake and lockdown drills provide 
students the opportunity to practice procedures in case a real crisis occurs. We have 
a zero
-
tolerance policy on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Igo
-
Ono School is a closed campus. All visitors are required to check in at the office upon 
arrival on campu
