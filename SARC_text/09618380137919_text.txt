By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Buckeye Union Mandarin Immersion Charter School is housed on the Oak Meadow Elementary School Campus.  The 
Buckeye 
Union School District is proud of the facilities that are provided for students and families. Each year parent surveys 
indicate that they are pleased with the condition of the schools.
 
 
Oak Meadow Elementary School was originally constructed in July 2003 a
nd is comprised of 32 classrooms,  one 
multipurpose room, one library, one staff lounge, one computer lab, and two playgrounds. While reviewing this report, 
please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the facility inspection process. The item
s noted in the table 
have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff of five (two full
-
time and three part
-
time) to ensure that the cleaning of 
the school is maintained to provi
de for a clean and safe school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ens
ures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure that efficient service and highest priority are given 
to emergency repairs.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Bud
get
 
During the recent economic crisis the State suspended their matching grant obligation to District's participating in the 
deferred maintenance program. District's were no longer required to match local funds with the grant, and District's were 
no longer
 
required to spend the grant on deferred maintenance projects. While the district is no longer matching the grant 
amount, the BUSD Board of Trustee's acted to keep whatever grant proceeds received dedicated to the deferred 
maintenance projects in the distr
ict. While the budget has been reduced by 50% the district is still operating the program 
to maintain its facilities.
