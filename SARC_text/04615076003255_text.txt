School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Welcome to Oakdale Heights Elementary School. Our school community includes a highly skilled and dedicated staff. Our 
staff is guided by the following pri
nciples.
 
1.
 
Maintain a safe and orderly learning environment.
 
2.
 
Continually strengthen academic instruction and programs.
 
3.
 
Maintain and strengthen communication between home, school, and community.
 
 
We believe communication between home and school is 
critical to the success of our students. In an effort to keep families 
informed we have developed the parent handbook. In addition, we have implemented the Parent Portal tool in ARIES for 
grades 4 and 5 where parents can view student progress throughout th
e year, online. We encourage families to contact 
the school with any questions, suggestions, or concerns that you may have at any time. Give us a call or make an 
appointment to see us. We recommend you contact your student's teacher directly with questions
 
pertaining to the 
classroom. Questions regarding arrival, dismissal, playground, and school
-
wide behavior expectations may be directed to 
the office or classroom teacher.
 
 
Our mission, as a community, is to inspire an excitement for learning in a safe and
 
nurturing environment where students 
can achieve personal success in their learning and become respectful, responsible, and productive citizens.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The 
percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

honors the reciprocal responsibility which exists between the home and the school in the education of children. For this 
reason, conti
nued parental involvement in the education of children contributes greatly to student achievement and 

to education. Parents and guardians
 
are strongly encouraged to communicate with school personnel so the home and 
school are reinforcing the same goals and values the parents have set for their children. The Oroville City Elementary 
School District shall include parent involvement strategies
 
as a component of instructional planning for all programs.
 
 
Parents at Oakdale have many opportunities to participate in school activities.  Parents serve on the School Site Council, 
English Language Advisory Committee, and the LCAP committee.  Parents al
so volunteer in the classrooms, participate in 
the PTO and activities provided by the PTO for students.  Other opportunities for parent participation are back to school 
night, open house/Art show, family game night and our monthly walk to school celebratio
ns.  At the end of the first 
trimester, parents are asked to attend parent
-
teacher conferences where parents and teachers can partner together to 
discuss student progress and how to best meet the individual needs of their children.
