By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Earlimart 
Elementary sets a high priority upon ensuring that there are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the 
school educational program. Textbook selection is done by the District, grade level, and subject area committees 
coordinated by District curricul
um. All texts must be adopted from the most recent approved State matrices or local 
governing board approved lists. Textbook purchases are consistent with the content cycles of the California Curriculum 
Frameworks as District Instructional Material Funding
 
and other funding sources permit. Categorical funding also allows 
us to purchase supplementary instructional materials for English Learners in kindergarten to fifth grades to accelerate 
pupils as rapidly as possible towards grade level proficiency in read
ing, writing, and speaking. These materials are used in 
addition to the basic Reading/Language Arts and other core materials provided for every student and are correlated to 
State Standards

aligned textbooks each year with new adoption cycles per core area

Earlimart Elementary School has made upgrades to the campus security, featuring a new computerized check in system 
for all visitors on the school campus.  A new fencing system to direct visitors to the office has been installed, thereby 
eliminating 
visitors from entering campus without checking in first.  Earlimart Elementary also has a camera system

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Earlimart Elementary
 
provides a safe, secure environment for learning. We have a School Safety Plan on file and available 
to all parents as well as the general public. The staff develops the plan with input from parents and community members 
to ensure a safe and nonviolent en
vironment. Earlimart Elementary follows a school safety plan outlining the procedures 
that will be employed when an emergency situation arises.  Procedures including fire, earthquake, campus security 
(lockdown), chemical accidents, bomb threat, air polluti
on episodes, tornados, and fallen air craft are carefully delineated 
in the school safety plan.  Educators and students practice drills, throughout the year to ensure they are familiar with the 
practices and protocols in case of an emergency.
 
 
Earlimart El
ementary School emergency preparedness plan has been written in compliance with California Education 
Code, Title V Education, and Section 560, which requires all public schools to have a written disaster preparedness plan. 
This plan is to be reviewed annua
lly. This plan was developed in cooperation with Federal and State guidelines and with 
teacher assistance. The plan includes specific courses of action to be taken in case of an emergency situation develops. 
Every employee of Earlimart Elementary School is
 
expected to be familiar with this plan in order to carry out his/her 

such civilian defense activities as may be assigned to them by 
their supervisors or by law. This safety plan was updated for 
the 2019
-
2020 school year, and staff members are briefed at the beginning of the school year about key elements in the 
plan, especially the areas of lockdowns, fire drills, earthquake drills, an
d school evacuation drills.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
Earlimart Elementary receives federal Title I funding that provides high
-
quality opportunities for students in 
high
-
poverty 
schools to meet district and state content and performance standards. These funds are intended to provide services for 
students who are at risk of failing to meet state and district standards in Reading, Language Arts, and/or Mathematics. 
Serv
ices are to supplement the core curriculum program by providing increased instructional time, more intense 
instruction (individually or in small groups), and/or a different type of program using specially selected materials and/or 
instructional techniques.
 
The intention of the program is to help students become successful (achieve grade level) in the 
core curriculum areas of reading, language arts, and mathematics. The Title I program requires parent participation and 
supports coordination with other progra
ms that provide funding for specific purposes.  This year we are implementing the 
Leader in Me as part of strengthening our school climate.  Leader in Me is a whole
-
school transformation model and 
process developed in partnership with educators that empowe
rs students with the leadership and life skills they need to 
thrive in the 21st century. It is based on principles and practices of personal, interpersonal and organizational 
effectiveness, and upon the powerful premise that every child possesses unique st
rengths and has the ability to be a 
leader.  Leader in Me helps students learn how to become self
-
reliant, take initiative, plan ahead, set and track goals, do 
their homework, prioritize their time, manage their emotions, be considerate of others, express 
their viewpoint 
persuasively, resolve conflicts, find creative solutions, value differences, and live a balanced life. The process helps 
students develop the skills and self
-
confidence they need to lead their lives and succeed in school and beyond.
 
 
We rec
eive Title III money from federal funding to provide supplementary services for English Learners. The general 
purpose is to develop fluency in English as effectively and efficiently as possible, to provide equal opportunity for academi
c 
achievement, to pro
mote positive self
-
concepts, and to promote cross
-
cultural understanding. Funds are allocated based 
on the number of English Learners in the school.
 
 
Earlimart Elementary also receives LCFF money from the state to provide materials and services to assist a
ll students, with 
a focus on English Language Learners, low
-
income students, as well as foster children, to achieve academic success. The 
process for deciding how to use this budget is to assess the needs of data and to gather input from staff, parents, an
d all 
stakeholders through monthly LCAP meetings. We have focused on adding to technology as well as tutors and Read 180 
classrooms for 4th and 5th grades. We have also purchased supplemental materials to assist with the teaching of the 
Common Core Standar
ds. We have also contracted for teacher training and professional development for the staff.

Professional development has become part of the daily work 
life of the Earlimart Elementary teaching teams. Teachers, 
administrators and support staff participate in workshops and seminars, coach one another, plan lessons together along 
with our Literacy Coaches, and collaborate for the purpose of student achievem
ent. The professional learning community 
understands that teachers need collaboration time with one another. As a result, there is much support for providing the 
time and resources teachers require for the purpose of changing their practice. Teachers are a
fforded opportunities to 
participate in curriculum development, learn and share successful methods of reaching students, discuss comprehensive 
and efficient ways to implement standards, and continue their own learning.
 
 
For the 2019
-
20 school year, Earlima
rt Elementary's primary area of focus for staff development has been on mathematics.  
We are also continuing the district mission of Creating Outstanding Readers and Writers in Earlimart (CORE).  Monthly 
Math professional development with a TCOE math coach
 
has been focusing on creating standards
-
based lesson plans for 
first best instruction.  These areas were selected due to the student achievement data collected in the areas of 
mathematics, language arts, and English Language Development (ELPAC).  The meth
ods of professional development 
delivery have been workshops before the school year, during school days with release time, professional development on 
Wednesdays, attendance at conferences, as well as on site coaching with Earlimart content experts.  Teach
ers are 
supported during implementation through in
-
class coaching, lesson planning assistance, demonstration lessons, principal 
and district walk
-
throughs, TCOE experts observing Writers Workshop and coaching teachers, as well as common planning 
time at th
e end of the school day. In addition, Earlimart Elementary has early release every Wednesday which allows staff 
time for collaboration and other professional development opportunities.
