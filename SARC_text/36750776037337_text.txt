Description
 
Desert Knolls is located on the west side of Apple Valley and was originally part of the Victor 
Elementary School District.  In 1987 Desert Knolls became part of the Apple Valley Unified School 
District.  The original buildings were built in 
1961 and a major renovation which added three 
additional buildings was opened in 1991.  The school neighborhood consists of mainly single family 
homes with some apartments and townhouses.  Apple Valley Road, a main artery through town, 
runs through the sch

in 1999
-
2000, that converted over to an Apple Valley Unified Preschool in January of 2001.  The 
preschool services 48 students equally divided between morning and afternoon sessio
ns.
 
 
Desert Knolls has a full
-
time SAI (Specialized Academic Instruction) teacher, a Special Day Class 
teacher for our moderate / severe children and three instructional assistants in the Special 
Education department serving kindergarten through sixth grad
e students.  Students who have an 
IEP with speech goals are met through a district speech pathologist.  Our EL students receive 
language supports through small group instruction with  their teachers and time with a para 
educator for additional support.  Ou
r classroom ratio's are PK
-
3 24:1, and 4
-
6th grade 32:1.
 
 
This year, we have 1:1 Chromebooks in the hands of every 2nd 

 
6th grade student to augment 
Common Core standards.  Additionally our Kinder and 1st grade classrooms have centers with 6 
-
 
15 Chromebo
oks for rotations.  Some of our supplementary standards based web programs are:  
www.readingeggs.com, mathseeds.com, handwriting without tears, happy numbers, starfall, CGI 
along with google.docs and all the Renaissance programs.  The programs available in
clude skill 
development in the areas of math, reading, language arts, science and social studies. All computers 
throughout the school are connected to the internet.
 
 
Desert Knolls has a full

time Librarian who serves all students, preschool through sixth g
rade.  The 
Desert Knolls library contains over 22,767  books.  Classes visit the library on a weekly basis.  Library 
skills are taught, book presentations are made, storytelling is enjoyed, and magazine reviews are 
given.  The library has computers availab
le to students throughout the day, and is set up for 
students to take Accelerated Reader tests and do research on subjects of interest.
 
 
We are implementing our Reading Intervention program for our Kinder 
-
 
2nd grade students.  
Students that scored a grade
 
levels or more below on the iReady(Reading Inventory) are placed in 
this program to improve their English Language arts 

 
reading comprehension, grammar and 
spelling.   The LLi program is a rigorous and effective program that teaches children to be fluent
 
in 
non
-
fiction and fiction materials along with phonics.  Additionally Desert Knolls has an intensive 
intervention before and after school program in addition to participating in the district wide 
Summer School program.
 
 
Also, through the LCAP, Desert Kno
lls offers orchestra to 4th, 5th and 6th grade students.
 
By law (California Education Code Section 60800), all public local educational agencies in California 
are required to administer the Physical Fitness Test (PFT) annually to all students i
n fifth grade.  The 
PFT was administered to our student in Spring of 2018.  The PFT assesses each students to level of 
health
-
related fitness.  Each teacher  designs the curriculum for their physical education program. 
Parents and guardians understand thei

results of their students test. This allows teachers, parents, and guardians to monitor changes in 
the student's fitness levels.

The mission of Desert Knolls Elementary School is for all student
s to be at or above grade level via state standards for reading, writing, 
and mathematics as we transitioned into Common Core. Additionally, Desert Knolls students can grow a proficiency band each ye
ar.  We 
celebrate their growth when it occurs.   Students

-
being are closely monitored and 
adjustments are made to their individual programs as needed.  Desert Knolls continues to provide the necessary skills to prep
are our 
students to successfully function in an ev
er advancing technological society.  Our goal is to provide a safe and orderly environment with 
clear expectations for student behavior through the Character Counts model addressing the 6 pillars of Character that are con
sistently 
enforced by the entire st
aff and PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention System).  Parents and staff work together to emphasize the value of 
education and to monitor the academic performance of students.  Desert Knolls is very proud of our history in the community. 
We have 
strong tra

t 
Nights.  We are pleased to have had a 90% average at our 2018 November Parent Teacher conferences.  We continue to encourage 
our 
parents to be actively involved at Desert Knolls.
 
 
Our 5th graders are required by Ed Code to take the Physical Fitness Test.  99% of the 5th grade class completed the test.  S
tudent's are

About 
the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Lo
cal Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities t
o address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For 
additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
"Effective with the October 2017 Facility Inspection, Apple Valley Unified School Dist
rict determined to hire a third party independent consultant to 
inspect the facilities of the District and complete the annual Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) Reports.  This procedure will e
stablish consistent inspection 
methodologies and reporting procedur
es on our annual FIT Reports."
 
 
Desert Knolls Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students.  The custodial staff consists of one daytime
 
custodian, one full
-
time 
and a part time evening custodian, who perform basic cleaning operations.
  
The campus, including the playground and equipment, is inspected daily by 
the custodian and proctors to ensure that the campus is clean, safe, and functional for our staff and students.  Site custodi
ans follow set procedures daily 
to ensure that an appro
priate environment is maintained.  Restrooms are checked periodically throughout each school day to ensure cleanliness and 
functionality.  An annual facilities inspection, using the state
-
adopted Facilities Inspection Tool, is conducted to ensure that the 

District maintenance personnel evaluate the facility throughout the year, make necessary repairs, and plan long
-
term projects with the site administrator. 
New playground equipment was ordered in the 1999

2000 school year.   It 
meets all state safety standards. The most recent site inspection was 
completed on 10/7/2019.
 
 
Desert Knolls has a closed campus.  This means that all visitors to our campus check in at the office before entering.  Deser
t Knolls employs five proctors 
for p
layground supervision throughout the school day.  Our staff provides supervision during arrival and dismissal times. All volu
nteers are required to 
have a current TB test, and have passed a background check.
