By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which 
data were collected:
 
September 23, 2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a part of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editi
ons for teaching language arts 
(reading, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathematics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
l
anguage texts are 
also up
-
to
-
date. Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, standards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Frameworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We h
ave an abundance of supplementary reading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elementary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leveled reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narr
ative as well as expository text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facilities
 
The Buena Vista School facility houses 19 classrooms, a half
-
time instructional coach, two district special day classes, Title 
I room, resource room, library media center, science r
oom, music room, art room, speech room, counseling room, kitchen 
and a large multiuse room. Renovated in 2000, the facility is safe, structurally sound and designed to support student 
learning. Outdoor learning areas provide attractive places for students,
 
staff and parents to gather to extend learning 
outdoors. Maintenance of facilities is a top priority in the district, even in times of significant budget constraints.
 
 
Students work in well
-
lit, heated and cooled classrooms and specialty rooms (art, music
, resource and science). Rooms 
are clean and well maintained to support teaching and learning. Every classroom has a telephone with access to an outside 
line, internet access and a teacher computer with mounted projector. Furnishings are in good repair and
 
of appropriate 
size for the students who use them.

The classrooms, common areas and grounds are kept clean and in excellent repair by site custodial and district 
maintenance staff. All toilets, those in classrooms and shared, are all in good repair and c
leaned daily by two full

time 
equivalent (FTE) custodians. The custodial staff is on duty from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., with a custodian cleaning classrooms 
every other day after students leave. At least one custodian is on campus for the many evening activit
ies on
-
site.
 
 
A high degree of supervision is present at Buena Vista before, during and after school. Staff is on yard duty before and 
after school in the student drop
-
off areas and at the points of departure of students from the campus. In addition, the 
y
ard supervision for before school and recesses is fully staffed.
 
 
Students participate in safety and school

supervisors, teachers and all staff and students are trained in techn
iques to use for situations that need redirection or 
correction. School rules are included in the parent handbook.

student body. District funds, augmented with parent funds, provide enough time for our libra
ry media specialist to keep 
our spacious library, with its large and current collection of books, open during school hours.
 
 
Our custodians take pride in their work, ensuring clean classrooms and a clean campus and grounds. Our school has 
extensive play fi
elds, which support daily P.E. classes as well as soccer, baseball, and lacrosse sports teams after school 
and on the weekends.
 
 
Walnut Creek is very proud of the funding, planning and effort put into planning for our facilities. To maintain high 
standards
 
of excellence and consistently modernize the site takes strategic planning. In 2009, we refurbished the 
playground and playing fields and have an improved track and pathway around the field for walking and running activities. 
In 2011, we renovated the kit
chen, installed an improved server
-
room HVAC and added shelves in our kindergarten. In 
2012, we added a new portable with new shrubbery planted in front, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant 
parking lot and sidewalk improvements, new ADA complia
nt drinking fountain and bathroom modifications, additional 
backpack hooks at the library and science room, exterior siding replacement, and painted restrooms. In 2015, with support 
from the City of Walnut Creek, we improved our parking and sidewalks and m
odified our entry area to improve student

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Parental Involvement
 
Buena 
Vista has an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA), School Site Council (SSC) and English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), which support vital programs, materials and services. The PTA and SSC meet monthly; all school 
community members are invited to t
hese open meetings. Community and school events build participation of our diverse 
community, with parent volunteers at the center of each.
 
 
Families and community volunteers are essential partners in education at Buena Vista. A visitor at Buena Vista migh
t see 
volunteers working in classrooms, helping with special programs, tutoring individuals or groups, doing clerical work, 
answering phones, running enrichment activities, checking books out of the library or other needed support work around 
campus. Famil

 
 
In addition to volunteer work at our school, parents fund several vital school programs at Buena Vista. Through the efforts 
of an enormous volunteer cohort, the PTA funds classroo
m supplies for teachers and many other programs identified 
through our site plan. The PTA at Buena Vista has a passion for building community with our families. It hosts many events 
throughout the year to bring families closer together: BV Celebrates, Mult

Culture Potluck and Food Truck Fridays.
 
 
Our SSC consists of an equal number of parents and staff members, and the Site Council oversees all fiscal resources and 
works to achieve the goals of the School Site Plan.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school 
safety plan is current and detailed. It was reviewed, updated and discussed with school faculty in August 2019.
 
 
We hold monthly drills and review safety procedures with students and staff on a regular basis. The plan is updated 
annually with input from st
aff and parents. A detailed earthquake
-
preparedness plan outlines the duties of all staff in the 
event of an earthquake and contains a complete list of the emergency supplies stored in a secure container on
-
site. Several 
staff members are trained in search
-
and
-
rescue procedures, CPR, and basic first aid as part of our preparedness plan. 
Parents receive regular information and reminders about our emergency procedures in eNews.
 
 
The school Leadership Team meets monthly, and the Disaster Prep team monitors sch
ool safety and meets as needed 
with the school principal throughout the year to work on specific improvements to playground supervision and campus 
safety issues as they arise.
 
 
In October 2018, all staff members became ALICE certified in an effort to bette
r prepare our staff members for active 
shooter emergencies. All emergency procedures were reviewed in August 2019.

All professional growth is determined by both school site 
and district strategic planning process, which is ongoing 
throughout the school year and culminates with an update in the spring of each year. Planning teams include all school 
and community stakeholders, and the work is based on site
-
needs assessments. In
put from all school and community 
stakeholders is collected during the planning process and is used to develop the district Local Control and Accountability 
Plan (LCAP).
 
 
For 2019
-
20, the district focus will be on the continued implementation of the recent
ly adopted math programs at both 
the K
-
5 and 6
-

addition to identifying the implementation of Common Core State Standards for professional growth in the dist
rict LCAP, 
other areas for professional development identified in the district LCAP are: Technology Integration, English Language 
Development (ELD) instructional strategies and Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) training.
 
 


identifies goals for supporting the district focus, staff members meet by grade level or departments to study student 
assessment data or student behaviors and dete
rmine how to improve instruction through research and effective 
pedagogy. Weekly collaboration time is provided for all TK
-
8 teachers. Instructional coaches provide individual student
-
centered coaching cycles and participate in grade
-
level and department m
eetings to support professional growth.
 
 
Individual teachers and administrators keep their skills current by researching about learning, attending workshops and 
classes and reading on their own. Some examples are attendance at various conferences: Teachers
 
College Reading and 
Writing Project, ISTE, PBL World, SVMI, Middle School Conference, Socratic Seminar, Reading Recovery, and technology. 
Teachers attend training sessions in differentiated instruction, special education, Next Generation Science Standards
 
(NGSS) and in all core curricular areas. Beginning teachers participate in a two
-
year induction program with a mentor who 
is trained through the Contra Costa County Office of Education Teacher Induction Program.
 
 
We continue to provide four days each scho
ol year that are dedicated to staff and professional development. The district 
ensures the agendas for these professional growth days are tied to areas defined by the strategic plan and LCAP.
