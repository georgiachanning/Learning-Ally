Principal's Message
 
 
As principal, I am pleased to present our Annual School Accountability Report for Rosa Parks

and public, informed as to the achievement and educational advanc
ements of Rosa Parks 
Elementary. Our mission is to provide all students with a prescriptive, challenging, differentiated,

Throughout the year, students are regularly assessed in Mathematics and Reading to inform 
teacher instruction. The goal is to hav
e all students meet and/or exceed the Common Core State 
Standards.

Partnerships with parents and our community 
 
 
Create more opportunities for staff to develop capacity in the areas of professional development, PLCs, and other instruction

strategies 
 
 
It is a pleasure to be a part of Rosa Parks Elementary School and we are proud of our students and their a
ccomplishments. 
 
 
Dawn K. Green, Principal 
 
 
Focus for Improvement
 

 
Rosa Parks will continue to focus on increasing the rigor of instruction to reflect the expectations of the Common Core. 
Common Core is a set of standards developed by the federal governmen
t in the hopes of unifying education standards 
nationwide. We will continue to improve reading strategies, small group instruction, and incorporate writing with a focus on 
academic language development. Instruction in mathematics will include the use of ha
nds
-
on materials (manipulatives) to 
build comprehension of math concepts and skills. Student progress will be measured through benchmark assessments in 
English and Mathematics.
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials. For
 
a list of some of the textbooks we use at our school, 
see the Data Almanac that accompanies this report.
 
 
We have also reported additional facts about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. This online report
 
shows whether we had a 
textbook for each student in each core course during the 2013

2014 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Rosa Parks Elementary School was constructed from part of the old Lynwood High School buildings and grounds in 1999. Since th
en one (1) new classroom 
building, in good condition, has been constructed. All of our restrooms are now in good condition. Our cam
pus is clean and well
-
maintained. In 2011
-
2012 we constructed a new playground and installed new equipment for our students. In 2012
-
2013 Rosa Parks will undergo a renovation of our computer 
labs.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are
 
available in an online supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
sys
tems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good re
pair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. 
The guidelines for this assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OP

School Safety Plan
 
Rosa Parks Elementary
 
School strives to be an inviting school where children and adults are safe. The safety of all staff and students is a primary
 
concern 
at Rosa Parks Elementary School. We plan in advance procedures to follow if and when emergency situations occur, thereby 
reducing the risks of 
unnecessary injury and minimizing confusion and complications.  The School Safety Plan is revised/updated yearly by the Schoo
l Safety Committee/School 
Site Council. This School Safety Plan has been developed to assist the faculty and 
staff of Rosa Parks Elementary School in the implementation of the 

 
and school safety 
education, which will include health, drug aw
areness, conflict resolution, and emergency procedures will be taught and incorporated in the school 
curriculum. Emergency drills are routinely held for earthquake and fire preparedness.
