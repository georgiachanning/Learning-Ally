By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
In the Spring of 2004, the School Board voted to have Hooker
 
Oak School pilot a K
-
8 program. Due to the lack of support 
to keep the 7th and 8th grade students, and the movement of all sixth graders to the Jr. High campuses, we currently are 
a TK
-
5 with the ability to expand if the need arises. At the same time, the
 
neighborhood boundaries were disbanded. 
Hooker Oak School is housed in a 70 year old building in a family neighborhood in Chico.
 
 
Hooker Oak School is a District and State of California Alternative School of Choice which serves pupils from all over Chic
o. 
The eighteen classes are self
-
contained and many are looped where teachers follow the students.   Grades 1 and 2, 4 and 
5 are looped. Grades TK, K, and 3 are self
-
contained and do not loop due to the individuality of the programs. Instruction 
is deliver
ed in a thematic, integrated instructional strategy with the opportunity of several "Being There" (field trip) 
experiences. Parental involvement is encouraged for at least two hours per week (on average) in the program.
 
 
The "Hooker Oak School Mission an
d Vision" was re
-
vitalized in the spring of 2012. It represents the goals and philosophy 
of the school. The Vision simply stated is "Growing a Community of Learners. Growth through the joy of creativity and 
discovery. Growth through educational excellence.
 
Growth through positive life choices." The vision is expanded through 
the school's mission statement:  "The learning environment at Hooker Oak will promote student participation in a variety 
of authentic and engaging curricular activities which foster the
 
development of the whole child. Students will demonstrate 
a proficiency in the curriculum standards while being supported in a nurturing educational program, balanced with high 
expectations for accountability, shared by students, teachers, and parents."

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
November 2019
 
 
Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in cl
ass. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Education. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
cu
rrently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comprised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to 
review textbooks in co
re subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the 
adoption cycle.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hooker Oak School was constructed in 1948; the third wing was added in 1958. In 1989 the main building underwent 
extensive reconstruction. An automatic sprinkling system was installed in 1991. The sc
hool has seven portable buildings 
on campus. The entire school is air
-
conditioned. Adult supervision of the facilities is provided in the morning in the 
multipurpose room for the breakfast program. During the recess times, the playground is supervised by s
taff members 
and parent aides. After school, students may be on the playground under the supervision of their parents or by the staff 
of the CARD After
-
school program, if they are enrolled in that program. The student delivery and pick
-
up area is supervise
d 
before and after school. There is a crossing guard before and after school. Gated fences that are maintained in a closed, 
latched, and locked condition enclose the school campus during school hours. Signage is posted at all gates notifying all 
visitors t
o check
-
in at the main office and be identified with a visitor's pass. This expectation is enforced campus
-
wide and 
adults without a visitor's pass are requested to get one from the office.

The classrooms are all from 850 to 950 sq. feet in floor space 
and provided with sink, counter
-
top, and storage facilities. 
The resources of adequate electrical and communication systems as well as reasonable display areas support the 
educational focus and purpose of the school. Although the school is seventy years of
 
age, the building is kept clean and in 
good repair. Defects and problems are reported and responded to by staff in order to maintain a safe and clean 
environment. The field and hardtop area is well designed for maximum use for both free
-
play at recess and
 
to support the 
school's Physical Education program. A separate fenced kindergarten play area is provided and supervised to allow the 
smaller students a more protected and appropriately secure area. The continued development of the physical facilities 
has 
been the focus of the parent group. The staff has a room used as a staff work room and meeting room. This room is 
provided as a work
-
preparation room which is equipped with a multitude of teaching literacy resources. The support staff 
is focused to provide
 
a clean and safe facility. A schedule for cleaning and safety inspection/correction is maintained and 
ongoing. Although an older facility, pride is taken to present the school as a quality institution. Classrooms and common 
areas are attended to regularly
 
in order to maintain the elimination of trash and cleaning of the floor surfaces as well as 
sanitation of the restroom areas. The outside areas are kept clean by efforts of staff and student leadership groups. 
Exceptional situations such as severe storms 
or damage from inclement situations are responded to in a timely manner 
by both school and district staff.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Curricular improvement is an integral and ongoing 
process at Hooker Oak, and is coordinated with District direction and 
effort. Hooker Oak staff members have participated in the following CUSD curriculum committees: District LCAP, District 
Leadership Council, District Advisory Council, District Curriculum
 
Council, English Learner Task Force, and Students with 
Disabilities Task Force. These committees and task forces develop district curricular frameworks and teaching guides which 
are based upon State content standards. At the site level, Professional Learn
ing Communities carry the main responsibility 
for curricular development, which is driven by the school plan and District direction. Teachers who have been designated 
as subject area resource persons play a leadership role on the component committees. Duri
ng the current school year the 
staff will continue to focus on mathematics instruction and on writing, and plan for how to use these in the classroom; 
implement the current adoptions, Treasures Language Arts and the math series of Everyday Mathematics, and
 
focus on 
integration with the existing curriculum; and explore and implement intervention strategies in language arts with an 
emphasis on writing, and math for students needing support in these areas. Staff is also engaged with the task of defining 
a cons
istent, cohesive, program for present and future teachers to implement in all classrooms. At Hooker Oak, a match 
between the written curriculum, daily classroom instruction and assessment of student learning is emphasized. With other 
schools in Chico Unifi
ed School District, Hooker Oak utilizes a "multiple measures" approach to assessment. Student 
achievement is evaluated based on the classroom curriculum as well as on the Common Core State Standards. Results of 
all assessments are transferred to the Distri
ct office, where the collected data is aggregated, disaggregated, and analyzed. 
The data provides important information about student progress, curriculum implementation and school accountability.
 
 
Beginning in the 2019
-
2020 school year, teachers in grad
es 3
-
5 are administering the Interim Assessment Blocks, a 
component of the CAASPP system. Teachers have received multiple sessions of professional development on the 
administration of these assessments as well as on the interpretation of the data. In addit
ion, professional development 
on the alignment between the targets and standards in math has been ongoing this year as a result of stagnant test scores 
in mathematics.
