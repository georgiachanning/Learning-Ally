School Description
 

 
 
Thomas Jefferson Elementary School is a large (609 students) TK
-
5th grade school with an excellent 
reputation in our community. Our goal is to provide a college
-
going culture for all Jefferson 
students. Jefferson's strength is teacher leadership at each gr
ade level. We are dedicated to 
promoting excellence in student achievement through deliberate and thoughtful instructional 
programs based on Common Core Standards and Next Generation Science Standards geared to 
meet the needs of our diverse student populat
ion. We are proud of our work to ensure students 
have a quality education that represents and celebrates the diverse cultures in the school (62% 
Latino, 15% African American, 10% Asian, 4% White, 4% Filipino). We are also actively engaged in 
staff developm
ent focused on Project Based Learning (PBL), Blended Learning and technology 
integration and instructional coaching to help our English Language Learners become proficient 
readers and writers. Additional resources are allocated to support instruction for E
nglish Language 
Learners, reading and math intervention and Special Education programs. We are committed to 
excellence for all students and we continually improve our instruction, curriculum, and resources 
toward that end.
 
 
The parents and community play a
 
crucial role at Jefferson. We welcome parents, family members, 
and the community to partner with us, including volunteering in our classrooms, in our library, in 
our office, or on the playground during recess and lunch. We encourage parent participation i
n the 
Parent and Teacher Association (PTA), the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), the School 
Site Council (SSC) and invite and encourage parent input into our school decisions. Connections 
between home and the school have included our parent enga
gement workshops, which include CA 
PTA School Smarts Academy, the monthly parent newsletter known as the Jefferson Journal, 
weekly announcements, and electronic messages through Parent Square and the PTA Facebook 
account. We are confident that by working c
ollaboratively with our parent community we can 
achieve our goal of excellence for all students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

C. Engagement
 
 
State 
Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each scho
ol site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are very supportive of the education program at Thomas Jefferson Elementary School. We have a number of parent groups
 
families participate 
in Parent
-
Teacher Association (PTA), Sc
hool Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Parents and Teachers Advocating for African 
American Student Success, (PTAAASS) and of course, volunteering in the classroom.  Jefferson has a growing PTA that advises t
he principal on al
l aspects 
of school governance and coordinates fundraising efforts to support the school through teacher grants, special projects, and 
assemblies.  The PTA Board 
of Directors and the general assembly meet monthly and coordinate parent outreach and special 
events such as the Obstacle
-
A
-
Thon, Pancake Breakfast 
and other amazing events. The SSC and ELAC meet monthly to facilitate the development of the School Plan for Student Achievem
ent (SPSA), and our 
new PATAAASS group is launching a poetry event this year.
 
 
Once a month, parents are invited to meet informally with the principal in the library for coffee and storytime.  This provid
ed casual conversation for 
families to share comments and ask questions about numerous topics.  A parent newsletter is posted on 
Parent Square monthly in three languages.  This 
newsletter provides families with a school calendar of upcoming events and information about school business.   Additionally,
 
the school website is kept 
up to date so parents can have the latest information a
bout the school.  Teachers utilize Class Dojo and Parent Square to communicate with families.  
Jefferson has a full
-
time parent liaison who is fluent in Spanish and who conducts further parent outreach and parent education programs such as S
chool 
Smarts Ac
ademy, Positive Discipline, Understanding Assessments and Blended Learning.

intruder drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.  During these monthly drills, staff goes over pr
ocedures with students and 
feedback is 
collected after each drill.  The feedback is reviewed by our safety committee and adjustments are made if needed. To ensure s
tudent safety, 
staff members supervise students at all times before and after school, and during recess and lunch. Jefferson is com
mitted to restorative practices and 
family partnerships in all matters of student safety and discipline.  All visitors to the campus are required to check
-
