School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This 
school has 23 classrooms of which 16 are in daily use. The campus has a multi
-
purpose room, a full service library, 
one to one technology and a computer lab. Jamul Elementary School received a modernization grant in 2003. All school 
buildings received an e
nergy efficiency upgrade from SDG&E which included new energy efficient lights, cleaning of all air 
conditioning/heating units, replacement filters, and light timers. In 2014 two classrooms were converted to administrative 
offices. Restrooms received ADA u
pgrades and additional ADA parking was added. The district food services department 
received a new, energy efficient walk in refrigerator/freezer. In 2015, new secure front gates were installed at the entrance
 
of the school. Grant funding was used to insta
ll a rainwater catchment system. During the summer of 2016 the playground 
was resurfaced. In November of 2016 a fire inspection was completed by the San Diego Fire Authority.
 
 
Our classrooms are cleaned on a daily basis with thorough, deep cleaning occurri
ng three times per year.
 
 
Classrooms in use are in good condition. The buildings that are not being used require new roofs, drywall repair. This is 
extensive work and will occur on a schedule based on need. A subfloor in a classroom was repaired over 
the summer of 
2018 in order to create a bookroom for guided reading materials. Roof and rain gutters were repaired over the summer 
of 2017.  Over the winter of 2019, a new roof was put in on a building containing three classrooms.
 
 
As we look to the future
, Jamul Elementary is planning to build a new Kindergarten classroom wing and playground in 
order to be prepared for additional students since new housing is slated to be built over the next 5 years. Also with the 
move of 4th and 5th grade students to the 
campus, during the 2019/2020 school year, the playground/field area will be 
reconfigured to meet the needs of all TK
-
5 students. The school was completely fenced in over the summer and prior to 
the start of the 2019/2020 school year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Schools should be a place where our children find a safe and secure environment. We have taken the following steps to 
ensure safety and security:
 

 
Emergency Plan for the District developed and updated annually
 

 
Scho
ol plan updated annually. Binders of emergency information are housed in the office
 

 
Locking front gates near the school office were installed in October 2015
 

 
Monthly earthquake, fire, and lock down drills are conducted. Some are unannounced. All are timed. Results 
are studied after each drill
 

 
Classroom doors are secure
 

 
Front office staff are diligent about recording important student information such as emergen
cy numbers, 
custody arrangements, and health concerns
 

 
We have a positive behavior management system that regularly rewards good behavior and attendance
 

 
Students who have behavior challenges are treated on an individual basis with interventions that might include 
and adult buddy,a behavior contract, or small group counseling
