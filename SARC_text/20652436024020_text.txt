M
illview Elementary School is focused on providing students with the best learning opportunities 
possible in an 
environment of cultural sensitivity that nurtures individual growth. The Millview staff 
believes that all students deserve to be challenged and motivated to reach their maximum 
potential. Reading is a primary focus at Millview, and every classroom teacher 
dedicates substantial 
time specifically set aside for differentiated small group literacy development, as well as language 
arts and math intervention. Teachers meet in Professional Learning Communities to discuss current 
student data and use best practices
 
to create responsive common lesson plans and interventions 
that address the common core standards. We also continue to address the needs of our English 
learners through focused instruction during the English Language Development (ELD) instructional 
period
. Throughout the day our classroom teachers use the English Learner Principles to provide 
greater access to all areas of the curriculum and foster language acquisition skills at the highest 
levels.
 
 
Our school is known for its longstanding, comprehensive R
esponse to Intervention program. Our 
COST (Coordination of Services Team) and SST (Student Success Team) meet every Wednesday, and 
are comprised of administrators, the intervention/RtI teacher, classroom teacher, and other 
support staff. Parents are also i
ncluded in the SST process. Our tier 3 students receive services in 
our intervention lab and/or in their classes, and classroom teachers provide targeted instruction to 
our tier 2 students in English Language Arts and Math four days a week. In addition, al
l teachers 
meet quarterly with administrators to review student performance data with a particular focus on 
our RtI and EL students, as well as robust, responsive first instruction for all. Millview students in 
grades 2 though 6 are monitored for growth on
 
a quarterly basis with comprehensive computer
-
based assessments in reading and math.

acquisition levels so that instruction can be targeted towards their specific areas of need. The emphasis is on oral language
, 
vocabulary, listening, reading, and writing. Millview provides informal assessments for our English Language Learners. Teache

Based Model of educating our students with special needs. These students are in the general 
education classroom the majority of the time, and are provided support from
 
a special education staff member during a portion of their 
day. Special education students are also pulled out of the general education environment for more intense instruction and sup
port based 

cation Plan (IEP). Millview has one full time special day class teacher serving 
students in 1st

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about 
the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educ
ational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability 
of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Madera Unified held a public hearing on September 25, 2018, and determined that each school within the district had sufficien
t and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science la
b equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classr
oom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the state ar
e reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the
 
district office prior to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Millview was built in 1956 and renovated in 2013. The school is in good condition, receiving positive ratings on the 
Williams Settlement legislation 
monitoring each of the past five years. The school looks clean and inviting. The school was repainted in the summer of 2015, 
including fresh trim and 
logo, and new carpeting was installed in all classrooms. Also during this 
time the cafeteria kitchen was remodeled, and the office flooring and furniture 
was replaced. In November 2015 the cafeteria floor was replaced. Millview has a well stocked and inviting library maintained 
by a part
-
time librarian. 
There is one computer lab
 
on campus, capable of servicing up to 35 students simultaneously, as well as computer carts containing chromebooks to be
 
utilized by all students in grades 2 through 6. The first grade classes at Millview are provided with 15 IPADs that they are 
using for
 
learning.
 
 
A large V
-

assrooms, six of 
which are utilized by the Madera County Office of Education. The majority of classrooms are 
modular, but have been permanently installed. Five 

eated on 10.9 acres, with 
51,190 square feet of constructed space. Millview allo

addition to monitored alarm systems for use during unoccupied hours, the perimeter gates are locked at all times, except for 
the beginning and end of 
the scho
ol
 
day. Our After School Program currently serves 140 students and provides a safe environment for students to finish homework, 
get additional exercise, 
and participate in enrichment activities until their parents are available. Many students ride a distri
ctprovided evening bus home from the after school 
program. Millview added a new building with three restrooms (including one reserved for handicapped).

-
time custodians who maintain the school between the hours of 6 A.
M. and 11 P.M. The principal works daily with the custodial staff 
to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and safe school. The district governing board 
has adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. A
 
summary of these standards are available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
On a regular basis, classrooms and facilities are inspected by the custodial staff and administration to identify needed clas
sroom repairs. District 
mainte
nance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair are completed in a timely manner. A work ord
er process is used 
to ensure efficient service, and highest priority is given to emergency repairs.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school 
district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Millview has an active body of parents who support the educational process and other school functions. We believe that there 
is ample opportunity for 
parents to 
be involved in school functions, and we provide a variety of forums for parents to participate and add their voice. Opportuni
ties include: 
Second Cup of Coffee meetings held the first Friday of each month, currently receiving a series of health
-
oriented wo
rkshops through Madera County 
Public Health Department; District Parent Advisory Committee; weekly Parent Resource Center sessions on ELD and/or Computer S
kills classes; School 
Site Council (SSC); English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC); Family Literacy
/Health and Wellness Night; and Family Math Night. The Millview Booster 
Club is actively supporting students and teachers through various fundraising activities to provide additional academic perfo
rmance and behavioral 
incentives and rewards, as well as ed
ucational field trips for students. Millview also provides parents the opportunity to participate with their student(s) 
in academic goal setting during our spring parent /student SAC goal setting nights. New to Millview during the 2019/2020 scho
ol year is 
our ELPAC parent 
informational meeting.
 
 
The Back to School Night at the beginning of the year and Open House in the spring are events that invite families to visit c
lassrooms and preview or 

e to school to discuss student progress with the classroom teachers during structured 
Parent Conference times four times a year. Spanish translation is provided at all events. The school has a strong base of par
ent volunteers who help out 
in the classrooms
 
and at various school functions. The school also benefits from several community partnerships including Yosemite Christian Ce
nter, 
Rancho San Miguel, Rotary Club, Madera Police Department, Chowchilla Corrections, and the VFW Post 1981.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides th
e following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is of utmost importa
nce at Millview Elementary. The school is always in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The goal of our Safe School Plan is to provide all students
 
with educational and 
personal
 
opportunities in a positive and nurturing environment, which enables them to achieve current and future goals. The School Saf
ety Plan was 
revised in February 2019 and reflected the needs of the school as determined by the site safety committee. Staff rece
ived targeted 
 
 
professional development on the components of the new school safety plan.
 
 
The school

s disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills
 
are conducted on a 
monthly basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held at least once a year.
 
 
Millview Elementary School students are well supervised. The Millview daily schedule has been developed in such a manner that
 
only one grade level 
will occupy a desig
nated playground area at any given time throughout the school day, which greatly enhances student supervision and safety. Mul
tiple 
teachers and/or yard duty aides are assigned to each playground supervision zone before school, during morning and lunch rece
sses, and for student 
dismissal. Site administrators and support staff supervise student drop
-
off and pick
-
up areas, bus zones, breakfast and
 
 
lunch times in the cafeteria, and the playgrounds during morning and lunch recess. The Millview teachers, in conj
unction with the Leadership/ PBIS 
Committee, regularly review the rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on the playground. Transitions of students
 
outside of classrooms are 
highly structured and are supervised by administration, teachers or ya
rd duty aides. Visitors must enter through the main door
