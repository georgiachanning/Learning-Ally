Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mariposa Elementary has a total of 38 classrooms, a library, an administration building with a staff lounge, a multi
-
purpose 
room and three separate offices for the speech pathologist, psychologist and instructional coach. The school facility offers 
a safe
 
learning environment with fully functioning lighting, heating and cooling systems, noise negation and solar panels. 
In addition to three separate play areas with playground equipment for kindergarten, primary and upper grade students, 
there is a large fie
ld with sufficient space for students to play. There are 13 restrooms available for students and 6 
restrooms designated for staff, all of which are in working condition. The school has an outside covered area with tables 
and a fully enclosed multipurpose r
oom that are used for breakfast, lunch and special school events. Wireless and/or 
network internet access is available in all buildings throughout the school.
 
 
Administrators meet weekly with the head custodian to discuss any maintenance, grounds, and/or c
leaning issues. A 
routine cleaning schedule is in place. The head custodian maintains cleanliness on the grounds daily. At night, classrooms 
have trash emptied daily and are vacuumed every other day. Deep cleaning occurs during extended breaks and the 
summ
er months. The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. Site and district 
maintenance and grounds staffs make sure that the work necessary to keep the school in good repair and aesthetically 
pleasing are compl
eted in a timely manner . A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority. The floors, walls, and plumbing system are all in good shape.
 
 
The LEA takes great efforts to ensure that all scho

Operations Department conducts an annual in
-
depth evaluation of each school to determine the condition of the facilities 
and identify situations that need maintenance, repair or 
an upgrade. The district uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction to assist with the data gathering during the 
inspections. All findings are shared with the principal and work orders for ne
eded repairs are created at that time. The 
results of this survey are available at the school office or the district office. The last state inspection mandated under th
e 
Williams Settlement was completed on August 21, 2019.
 
 
During the most recent Facility
 


throughout a walk through of our school. There were n
o extreme deficiencies found and no There were no  good repair 
deficiencies.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
