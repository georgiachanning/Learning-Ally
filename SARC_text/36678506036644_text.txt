About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

ssrooms, two County
-
sponsored buildings for the Hearing Impaired, a State pre
-
school facili
ty, a computer lab, a keyboard lab, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a library, a staff 
room, and three playgrounds. The most recent upgrades to the campus occurred in 2006 and included the installation of a shade

School Safety 
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Henry Elementary School. All visitors to the campus must sign in at 

pass at all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the
 
safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch, and after school. Supervision is a 
responsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators. To further safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a 
comprehens
ive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the School Site Council. The Safety Plan was most recently updated in March
 
2018; any 
revisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following: 
 

 
School rules & procedures
 

 
Disaster procedures/routine & emergency drills
 

 
Current status of school crime
 

 
Notification to teachers
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures
 

 
School
-
wide dress code
 

 
Policies related to suspension/expulsion
 

 
Sexual harassment policy
 

 
Safe ingress & egress of pupils, parents/guardians, & school employees
 
The school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthqua
ke standards. Safety drills, 
including fire, earthquake, and
 
code yellow are held monthly.
 
 
Cleaning Process 
 
 

dopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operat
ions are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to 
develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. 
 
 
Maintenance & Repair 
 
 

nctions occur
ring during 
vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by Rialto Unified School District to ensure t
hat school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair 
requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which 
they are received. 
 
 
Facility Improvements / Deferred Maintenance 
 
 
The district has a five year, Deferred Maintenance Plan designed to address expenditures for major repair or replacement of e
xi
sting school building 
components and any needed Facility Improvements. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating electrical systems, inter
ior or exterior painting, 
and floor systems.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

in Learning; Understanding 
and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning; Assessing Student Learning
; Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning; 
Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all Students; and Developing as a Professional Educator.

school day with substitutes 
provided, after school, on
