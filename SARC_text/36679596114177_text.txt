By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

A Message from the Superintendent
 
Dear Yucaipa
-
Calimesa Community, Parents and Students:
 
 
YCJUSD is honored to serve students in two wonderful communities. We, as a team, continue to prepare our students to 
be successful in the 21st century.  We work
 
collaboratively with community partners, businesses and colleges to provide 
the best possible education for each and every student. The district employs high quality employees, who care for student 
well
-
being as well as academics.  The school sites have a
 
variety of clubs and programs to suit student interests and all our 
elementary schools have an after school  care program.   We strive to provide a wide variety of high quality services and 
programs in a safe environment.
 
 
As you become a partner of the Y
CJUSD, please take the opportunity to be involved. It is our desire to work hand in hand 
with parents to support our children. The best way to get involved is to start at the school site. Our principals can help 
guide you to the many opportunities that exi
st. No amount of involvement is too small!  We also offer classes for parents 
that will help you and your child in their educational journey.  We have the Family Learning Center which offers a host of 
classes that support parents in learning strategies to 
work with children in grades K
-
12.  Please take an opportunity to 
view the website to learn more about the classes.
 
 
The role of educating children in our two communities is taken very seriously and we appreciate your trust. My goal, as 
your Superintendent
, is to ensure that high quality instruction is delivered daily, our campuses are secure and well 
maintained, money is spent wisely, and students graduate from Yucaipa High School prepared to be successful!
 
 
This school year is the opportunity to work with
 
you in supporting education of our children.   Please do not hesitate to 
contact your principal or the district office if you have questions about the district or how to become involved.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
The Yucaipa
-
Calimesa Joint Unified School District sets a high priority to ensure that sufficient and current textbooks and 
materials are available to
 
support each school's instructional program. The district went through an evaluation on October 
1, 2019, and has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, and/or science lab equipment pursuant to 
the settlement of Williams vs. the St
ate of California. The district determined that there are also sufficient visual and 
performing arts materials.
 
 
All students, including Special Education and English Learner students, have access to adopted instructional materials in 
core subjects.  These
 
materials are for use in the classroom and/or to take home to complete required homework 
assignments.  All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district are aligned with the California State Conten
t 
Standards and Frameworks.
 
 
Instructiona
l materials in all subjects were approved by the Board of Education. Although the Board
-
adopted instructional 
materials in Mathematics are not on the State Board of Education list, the materials were recommended by an adoption 
committee of staff and commun
ity members following extensive research on the alignment of the materials to California 
State Content Standards and Frameworks, and a pilot of the materials to study their positive impact on the children we 
serve. The district has not yet adopted instruct
ional materials in History
-
Social Science in the time since the State Board 
approved History
-
Social Science programs in November, 2017. The district is collaborating with community stakeholder 
groups to determine the most appropriate materials for implemen
ting the state standards and framework in History
-
Social Science.
 
 
Wildwood Elementary School students visit the library on a bi
-
weekly basis. The library offers a varied selection of 
Accelerated Reader books that are identified for various reading levels.

however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calcula
ted using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Wildwood Elementary School is a closed campus. During school hours the entrance is secured to ensure visitors check in 
with the front office. All visitors must be buzzed in, are required to then sign in, be verified as able to safely volunteer 
through the 
raptor Visitor Management System,  and wear an issued  visitor badge during their stay.  While visits by 
parents and community members are welcomed, anyone wishing to be on campus before, during or after school hours 
should notify the staff ahead of time a
nd make proper arrangements. During lunch, breaks, and before and after school, 
yard duty aides, the principal, and teachers supervise students and monitor the campus. The Comprehensive School Safety 
Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate
 
Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997 and is updated annually.
 
 
The plan provides students and staff a means of ensuring a safe and orderly learning environment. Each school includes 
the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: current status 
of school crime; child abuse reporting 
procedures; disaster procedures, routine, and emergency; policies related to suspension and expulsion; notification to 
teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress 
of pupils, parents, and 
school employees to and from school; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.  The school 
evaluates the safety plan annually and updates it as needed throughout the school year. The plan is updated annua
lly to 
include new staff, update comprehensive fire and earthquake drill details, Lockdown Drills and other disasters types as 
well as procedures. Safety procedures, including elements of the School Safety Plan, are posted online in the Faculty 
Handbook an
d staff reviews this at the beginning of the school year and continuously throughout the year as appropriate 
through safety team meetings.
