Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Forest Grove School seeks to provide a quality educational
 
program for each of its students. We embrace the fact that the 
school serves students of different backgrounds, abilities and interests. We are committed to offering challenging 
programs in a positive educational environment that develops individual stude
nts to their greatest potential. This 
environment fosters mutual respect, communication and compassion within the entire school community.
 
 

 
educational experience. Not stated, yet understood in this statement, is the fact that children have different educational 
needs and challenges at each grade level.  Additionally, the staff has written Core Values statements which convey both 
the philosop
hy and the commitment of the faculty to the students, each other, parents, and the greater community.
 
 
Early primary grades (TK
-
2) focus on beginning reading, language arts and mathematical concepts and skills. Third grade 
is a transitional year between sk
ill development and concept application. In language arts the transition is from learning 
to read to reading to learn. There is an emphasis on encouraging independent personal responsibility. The intermediate 
grades (3
-
5) emphasize core curriculum while fo
cusing on preparing students for the transition to middle school. Forest

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Forest Grove continues to have many improvements t
o its campus. During the summer of 2016, a $500,000 parking and 
drop off reconstruction project was completed allowing for smoother traffic flow and improved access to the front of our 
school. Working with parent and staff volunteers, the playground area w
as painted and some games were added over the 
past two years. The learning environment has received several technology updates including class sets of Chromebooks 
in grades 3
-
5, six tablets in TK
-
2 classrooms, and video surveillance cameras. We expect the 
technology component of 
classrooms to continue to grow as funds from the educational technology bond become available. In 2018, we added two 
modular classrooms to house our expanding program offerings. A new playground structure is scheduled to be 
construc
ted in the Spring of 2020.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pri

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents and the 
community are an integral part of Forest Grove School.  Teachers welcome and receive a high number of 
volunteers in their classrooms. School
-
wide functions (i.e. Back
-
to
-
School Night, Open House, holiday programs, Trunk or 
Treat, Ice Cream Social, Parent C
onferences, Butterfly Parade and Bazaar, Family Game Night, and Falcon Fun Fest) are 
well attended. Forest Grove has an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), 
and School Site Council (SSC).  The PTA has sought 
to provide additional welcome to new parents (often military) into the 
Forest Grove community through the Falcon Friends program. Forest Grove has intensified its efforts to increase parent 
involvement in 2019
-
2020. These efforts include a series of parent
 
education classes covering topics such Managing Your 
Child's Temper and Tantrums, Building Loving Sibling Relationships, and Preparing for Life's Transitions. These classes are 
offered in conjunction with Pacific Grove Adult Education. In addition, Forest
 
Grove has morning Coffee with the Principal 
events where topics such as character development and efforts to prevent bullying are discussed. Forest Grove also held 
a school safety update for parents on the first day of school where more than 100 parents w
ere in attendance as well as 
a morning meeting to discuss our social emotional learning program called the Toolbox. Parents are also given a voice in 
school decision making through their roles on the English Language Advisory Council.

-

Forest Grove's comprehensive safety plan is reviewed each year by our site safety committee and 
the School Site Council. 
The plan was most recently reviewed in October 2019. We have adopted the "Big Five" approach to emergency response 
and all staff receives annual training on the five types of emergency response 
-
 
shelter in place, evacuation, secur
e campus, 
lockdown
-
barricade, and drop
-
cover
-
hold on. Our comprehensive safety plan also contains our drill schedule, school rules, 
and an overview of the character development used at Forest Grove (Character Counts) and social emotional learning 
program (
The Toolbox) used at Forest Grove.

The students at Forest Grove receive instructional support in their classrooms from their teacher and a part time 
Instructional Assistant.  Outside of the classroom, students performing below grade level in language arts and math may 
participate in a pull out program using supplemental materials to help close the gap between their current level of 
understanding and grade level expectations. We also have a Resource Program, and Two Intensive Academic classrooms 
serving students who need
 
more direct forms of instruction and alternative curriculum.
