School Description
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Studebaker Elementary School is located in
 
Norwalk, California. With approximately 500 students, 
we proudly serve students in Transitional Kindergarten through 5th grade. Over the years, our 
school has received several accolades. Studebaker has received the Title 1 Academic Achievement 
Award for s
even years 

 
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017. We have also received the 
California Business for Education Excellence (CBEE) Honor Roll Award for eight years 

 
2009, 2010, 
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition to these recognitions,
 
Studebaker is proud to 
be a recipient of the California Distinguished School Award for three years in 2004, 2008 and 2014 
and most recently, Studebaker was named a 2016 Gold Ribbon School. Although these accolades 
are wonderful to receive, the true measur
e of our success is through our community and parent 
feedback. Annually, our parents fill out a survey regarding school satisfaction. Parent survey results 
demonstrate that 97% of our parents are satisfied with Studebaker and 98% of parents agree that 
Stud
ebaker is a safe environment for students.
 
 
With student academic and social success
 


and enrichment in the area of language arts. In addition to these academic programs, we also offer 
progra

counselors and from an intern from Turning Point. In addition, we also provide our students with 
the Arts for All Program, which encompasses instruction in music, art, an
d physical education. For 
the past year we have offered an after school STEM program for students in grades 4 and 5.  We 
acknowledge the importance of educating the whole child in order for children to be successful.
 
 
We continue to focus our attention on 
the needs of all of our students, regardless of their learning 
requirements. Our instructional program is designed to address the academic, social, emotional, 
and physical needs of all students

including English Learners, gifted students, and those with 
sp
ecialized learning plans. Each year, we are increasing the technology at our school. The district 
technology teacher has allowed us to provide students with technology based instruction, as well 
as provide our teachers with the necessary staff development 
to integrate technology in lessons 
across the content areas. Currently, all of our 2nd 
-
 
5th grade classrooms have a chrome book cart 
in their classrooms. Our TK 
-
 
1st grade classes have 6 chrome books and mainly use them as a 
center.
 
 
Our families generou
sly support our efforts, and we encourage their continued involvement 
throughout the coming year.

About the SARC
 
By Feb
ruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fun
ding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state
 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the s
chool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Scho
ol Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Studebaker Elementary School has 22 regular classrooms, 7 portable classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an adminis
tration building. The 
main campus was built in 1954 and is in 
good condition. Additions were constructed in 1997, 2000, and 2002. In 2008

2009, we updated the bell and 
alarm system throughout the entire campus. In 2012, all exterior lights were replaced. New LED lighting was installed in all 
classrooms and offices 
th
roughout the campus. In 2019 new exterior L.E.D lighting was install and computer network wiring was upgraded for improved sp
eed.
 
 
Our two custodians clean each classroom every other day and the restrooms every day. District maintenance maintains landscapi
ng on an every
-
other
-
week basis.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects o
f our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired,
 
this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to making those repairs. The guidelines for this assessme
nt were 
written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can loo

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parental involvement is essential for the success of our students. We have successfully integrated a three
-
tiered parent involvement approach to ensure 
that we are involving parents at every level of need. This tiered approach
 
ensures that there are different opportunities for parents from school wide 
events, parent trainings, and parent leadership positions.
 
 

ker, with the strong support of 
our Parent Teacher Association (PTA), has community events such as Moms and Muffins, Dads and Donuts, Spooky Story Night, Tru
nk or Treat, Family 

rporated parent trainings focused primarily on mathematics, as well as 

n opportunity for 
families to interact in a fun and educatio
nal way. Lastly, we have an active PTA, School Site Council (SSC), and English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC). 
SSC and ELAC assist in the development and monitoring of the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) and Local Control Accountability Plan 
(LCAP).
 
 
Volunteers are an integral part of our school. We count on them on a daily basis to assist in our classrooms and help organiz
e our weekly parent 
communication folders. This past school year, we continued our parent Coffee Club that serves as mater
ial preparation for teachers, helps parents to get 
to know one another, and provides another opportunity for parent training. Our volunteers are recognized for their time and c
ommitment during an 
annual Volunteer Breakfast at the end of the school year. Pa
rent involvement opportunities are supported by our LCAP 28 funds.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):

School Safety Plan
 
Student safety is top priority at Studebaker. We have 
systems in place to ensure that all students are physically and emotionally safe and secure. Safety 
measures start as soon as our gates open to our students each and every morning. This year we redesigned our parking lot to h
elp direct traffic and 
prevent 
the need for cars to back up where students are walking. In addition, we have three teachers and five supervisors on morning 
duty to ensure 
safety. A supervisor is placed in the Kindergarten line up area to ensure that our Kindergarten students are ready e
very morning. All visitors must enter 
through the main office, sign in, and affix a visitor's pass. We maintain a closed campus at all times. Aside from the daily 
procedures to get students to 
class safely, we also practice regular disaster drills in the e
vent of an emergency. Studebaker participates in the annual California Great Shakeout in 
preparation for an earthquake. This year the district provided Active Shooter Training. This training helped staff to better 
understand what to do in the 
event of an e
mergency. Parents and students understand the seriousness of emergency preparedness. Parents are appreciative of the safety m
easures 
put into place. Based on parent survey results, 98% of parents agree that Studebaker provides a safe environment for their 
children.
 
 
Aside from physical safety, Studebaker also recognizes that students must feel emotionally safe, as well. To ensure the emoti
onal safety of all of our 
students, all staff has been trained in the "Positive Behavior Intervention System" (PBIS) as 
well as Second Step, which is a social emotional learning 
program whose curriculum help create a more empathetic society, by providing educational tools that allow students to take an
 
active role in their 
emotional growth.  As a school, we have chosen book
s to reinforce positive behavior and interaction between students. We have a new school wide 
book approximately every 6 weeks. Every classroom on campus has a copy of the book. There is also a copy in the office for pa
rents to view. In addition, 
counseling
 
services are also made available to all students, when needed.  This ensures the we teach students school wide expectations, 
while focusing 
on positive reinforcement to encourage students to demonstrate these expectations daily. The addition of an element
ary counselor has increased the 
amount of services that we can provide to our students.

This year, all teachers are receiving Math and NGSS Science training. Each site has 3 teachers who will serve as coaches.  Ad
ditionally, teachers will 
participate in Thinking Map training. Thinking Maps provides students with a variety of ways to organize 
their learning.  In previous years, teachers have 
received district level training in Focused Instruction, Lesson Study, and on the California State Standards. These trainings
 
are revisited often so that 
teachers are given support throughout the applicatio
n of these frameworks. The Student Achievement Leadership Team (SALT)  also provides professional 
development wihich focuses on a specific area of need in ELA determined by the analyzing SBAC.  SALT meets monthly to discuss
 
progress and conducts 
PD during 
staff meetings.  At the site level, teachers are provided with review of research
-
based strategies, such as Guided Reading and Book Clubs, as 
well as the Elements of Effective Instruction. This upcoming year, professional development will continue to focus
 
on math instruction, with an emphasis 
on building conceptual understanding.Teachers have participated in Vertical Articulation. This means that teachers have had t
he opportunity to meet 
with teachers in the grade level below and above to ensure students h
ave the opportunity to learn what is needed for the following year.  In addition, 
training and support will continue in the area of Directed Reading (Guided Reading and Book Clubs), as well as Close Reading.
 
Coaching will be provided 
in the area of directe
d reading this school year.  Teachers are also released from their classrooms one full day with their grade level teams. This
 
allows 
them to do long range planning per trimester. Lastly, throughout the year grade level teams meet bi
-
monthly for 90 minutes 
of uninterrupted time for 
data reflection sessions. During this time, student assessment results are analyzed allowing teams to make informed decisions
 
for instruction based on 
students strengths and needs. Upcoming units are discussed with a focus on Acad
emic Language. Rigor and Depth of Knowledge (DOK) levels are also 
discussed. These meetings are facilitated by the school principal. Professional development opportunities are supported throu
gh our LCAP 7 funds.

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
