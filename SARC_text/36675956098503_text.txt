Whether you are a student, parent, staff, orcommunity member, the data contained within these pages will prove useful in informing youabout our academic achievement, professional staff, curricular programs, instructional materials,safety procedures, classroom environment, and condition of facilities. At Stork, our goal is toprovide a standards-based, challenging curriculum by a dedicated professional staff based onthe individual needs of the students. Ongoing evaluation of student progress and achievementhelps us refine the instructional program so students can achieve academic proficiency.In accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annualSARC. However, we view this as not only a means of complying with State legislation, but anopportunity to publish the accomplishments we take great pride in sharing, and set forth goalsfor future endeavors that will be paramount in determining the effectiveness of next year'sprograms. In Spring of 2019, Stork students participated in the California Assessment of StudentPerformance and Progress (CAASPP) which is a comprehensive standards-based, end of yearassessment that measures progress towards college and career readiness. Stork's baselinepercentages for students who met/exceeded standards were as follows for grades three throughsix: English Language Arts 79% and Mathematics 73%. In an effort to continue to improve untilall of our students are proficient in State Standards, we will implement school and grade levelimprovement plans to move forward until we reach that goal. We are actively involved in staffdevelopment to improve teaching strategies and student achievement. Our ultimate goal is toprovide our students with a safe learning environment so that we can effectively prepare ourstudents for their future college and career path.
