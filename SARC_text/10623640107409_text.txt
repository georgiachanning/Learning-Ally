By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

learning experience in a caring and nurturing environment so that students feel valued and respected. Our mission is to 
prepare all students in acquiring the skills needed to be successful leaders, life

needs and concerns. Our School Slogan: "Be a PROUD, TOUGH, and DETERMINED!"
 
 
Benavidez Elementary is located in the 
City of Parlier in Fresno County.  It is nestled in the heart of the great Central San 
Joaquin Valley of California. Parlier is a place rich with cultural heritage and ablaze with lively memories of Latino
-
rights

We are committed to the safety and security of each and every student.  This respect for children resonates in our school 
policies, practices and cultur
e. To maintain these optimal conditions, which contribute to the best possible working and 
learning environment, we enforce the policies set by our Governing Board and all California Educational Codes. Our facility 
occupies approximately 10 acres from Mads
en Ave. to Tuolumne Ave.
 
 
At Benavidez Elementary we utilize Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Positive Behavior Interventions 
and Supports (PBIS) is a process for creating school environments that are more predictable and effective for 
achieving 
academic and social goals. A key strategy of the PBIS process is pro
-
active. In conjunction with TIME to teach, our students 
are provided with Teach
-

sch

practice, all stakeholders use a consistent set of behavior expectations and rules. When some students do not respond to 
teaching of the behavi
oral rules, we view it as an opportunity for re
-
teaching. Our goal at Benavidez Elementary is to 
create a school community where all students, parents, and staff have a great learning experience while maximizing 
student achievement! Benavidez is a PBIS pla
tinum site.
 
 
As we continue our shift toward implementation of the Common Core State Standards; our teachers will focus on teaching 
skills students will need for college and career readiness. Mathematics and Reading/Language Arts, with a specific 
emphasis 
on reading comprehension and writing strategies, will continue to be emphasized. Teachers will continue to 
provide our students with the necessary skills to become proficient writers. We will continue to implement and refine our 
strategies that engage all 
students in every lesson throughout the entire school day while infusing technology skills.
 
 
All students at Benavidez, Kindergarten through Sixth Grade have been utilizing their one to one iPads in the classroom to 
conduct research, learn keyboarding skil
ls, and take notes from lectures and videos. Engaging students in the use of 
technology will continue to be a focus throughout the 2018
-
2019 school year. It is our goal that all students are proficient 
in age
-
appropriate computer literacy skills; students 
will use a variety of technological tools to complement and enhance 
classroom instruction.
 
 
All students benefit when they come to school every day and arrive on time. Daily attendance increases academic 
achievement. Regular attendance and punctuality teac
h students work habits that are necessary for their entire education 
and work careers. Finally, student attendance is essential to ensure each child receives access to the high caliber 
educational program provided by our highly qualified teachers. There ar
e many occasions at Benavidez Elementary where 
we acknowledge, reward, and reinforce good attendance and punctuality! I invite you to stop by the school, introduce 
yourself, and allow us the opportunity to get to know you. We are truly grateful for all of 
the residents of our community 
for continuing to value and support education as we look forward with anticipation to a wonderful educational experience 
with all of our Benavidez Bengals!

continually strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support student learning 
and provides oppo
rtunities for parent participation in our Valley PBS parenting classes.  Our teachers continually inform 
parents of the grade level instructional focus, school activities, student showcase events on campus, and provide practical 
ideas for parents to help t
heir children. Benavidez Elementary invites parents to the Title I Parent Involvement Meeting 
to share with parents and community how Benavidez is performing as a school. Parents are active on campus, on field 
trips, and support our programs through classr
oom volunteer efforts following our district parent volunteer policy, the 
School Site Council (SSC), and the English Learner Advisory Committee. Our School Site Council (SSC), which includes 
parent and certificated members, approves our 
School Plan
 
for Stu
dent Achievement.  Our English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC) helps our SSC in making recommendations for our students learning English and provides suggestions 
on improving student attendance. The school has a strong base of parent volunteers who help 

Red Ribbon Activities, and Winter programs.  Our parents regularly receive phone notification of school activities. Parents 
are also invited to participate in the PTC which supports student activities. Additional opportunities 
for parental 
involvement also exist at the district level. If you are interested in helping, please contact the school office. The contact

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A safe and supportive school culture is a primary focus at Benavidez Elementary. Our buildings and grounds are very safe. 
Staff members monitor our campus before school, after school, and during recess. All visitors must sign in and out at the 
front office
 
as soon as they come onto our campus. Office staff provides visitors with an I.D. badge to wear which must be 
worn and visible while on campus and returned to the front office when visit is completed.  We screen volunteers through 
our district parent volu
nteer policy. Once they have been cleared, they must sign in and out in the office. Our East and 
West gates remain locked during the school day, facilitating a safer morning drop off and afternoon pick up procedure. 
There is a designated area for student d
rop off and pick up. Our Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) 
framework is based on principles of applied behavior analysis and the prevention approach and values of positive behavior 
support. The integration of our Time to Teach and Charact
er Counts lessons which promote six ethical values via the pillars 
of Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and Citizenship along with Benavidez strict discipline policie
s 
curtail fighting and bullying. We hold a monthly Character Cou
nts assembly to acknowledge students that are representing 
the pillars. Discipline is handled in a fair and consistent manner. We routinely review playground safety rules with 
students, and we hold fire, lockdown, and earthquake drills regularly. The schoo
l is always in compliance with all laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials, and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan is 
annually updated with input of parents, classified and certificated personnel. The plan is the
n approved by our School Site
