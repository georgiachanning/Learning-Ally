About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. 

cilities remain up to date 
and provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
District mainten
ance and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timel
y manner. A 
work order process is used by school and district staff to communicate nonroutine maintenance requests. Emergency repai
rs are given the highest 
priority. 
 
 
2018

19 Campus Improvements:
 

 
Installation of solar panels in the playground and parking lot
 

 
Installation of new tether ball courts
 

 
Installation of LCD projectors in some classrooms
 
 
Planned 2019
-
20 Campus Improvements:
 
 
Every morning before school begins, the day custodian unlocks the school gates and inspects facilities for safety hazards or 
other conditions that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One day custodian and two evening custodi
ans are assigned to Valley View Elementary 
School. The day custodian is responsible for: 
 

 
Cafeteria Cleanup/Setup
 

 
General Maintenance
 

 
Restrooms
 
 
Restrooms are checked throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening custodi
ans are responsible for:
 

 
Classrooms
 

 
Restrooms
 

 
Office Areas
 

 
Afternoon/Evening Events Preparations
 
 
The principal and secretary communicate with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues. In order 
to improve the the day to 
day operations of Valley View School. 
 
 
We conduct the following:
 
 
* Principal and head custodian conduct
 
monthly site inspections.
 
 
* Review and analyze the findings of the County site inspection. The principal and the custodial staff meet to identify areas
 
of strength and weaknesses. 
A plan of action is created to improve the day to day operations of the si
te. Special projects are planned during non student days. 
 
 
Community Out Reach
 
 
Valley View School works in collaboration with South West Church every year to beautify the school. For the last past two yea
rs over 50 volunteers have 
assisted staff, parents
 
and students with the painting of 30 classrooms throughout the campus. The projected plan is to have the entire school painte
d 
within four years. 
 
 
Campus Supervision
 
 
School administration and teaching staff place a high priority on providing adequate ad
ult supervision on campus before, during, and after school. As 
students arrive on campus each morning, the following individuals are strategically assigned to designated entrance areas, th
e breakfast area and 
playground: the principal, assistant principal,
 
instructional aides, classified staff, noon supervisors, teachers, and crossing guards. During breaks, students 
are supervised by the principal, assistant principal and yard duty supervisors. Yard supervisors and classified staff monitor
 
lunch time activi
ty in the 
cafeteria and on the playground. At the end of the day when students are dismissed, the principal, assistant principal, teach
ers, crossing guards and 
classified staff monitor student behavior to ensure a safe and orderly departure. The administra
tion assists with morning, lunch, and afternoon 
supervision of students.
 
 

ear identification badges while 
on school grounds. Head S
tart parents are the only parents allow to walk their children to their classroom. Upon entry Head Start parents must present
 
their pickup and drop up badge in order to have access to the campus.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
S
marter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligi
ble students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Level 3

oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who p

the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
