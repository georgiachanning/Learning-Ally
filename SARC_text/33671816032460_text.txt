By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Felix J. Appleby Elementary is a brand
-
new 
state
-
of
-
the
-
art facility built in 2009. The school has 33 classrooms, athletic 
fields, a library with computers, computer lab, multipurpose room and 13 portable classrooms in addition to the 
permanent classrooms. Felix J. Appleby Elementary provides a saf
e, clean environment for learning through proper 
facilities maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance and repairs ensure current facilities remain up
-
to
-
date and provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Campus maintenance: The custodia

classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff and visitors. One 
full
-
time day custodian is assigned to Appleby and m
eets regularly with the principal to discuss school maintenance and 
safety issues.
 
 
The day custodian is always available for emergency situations. Day custodian responsibilities include preparing and 
cleaning the cafeteria for breakfast and lunch, cleanin
g restrooms, keeping the school office clean, setting up furniture 
and equipment for school events or assemblies, and routine maintenance projects. Every morning before school begins, 
the day custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards or other condit
ions that need attention prior to students and staff 
entering school grounds. Any graffiti or signs of vandalism are removed prior to students arriving at school. Throughout 
the day, the custodian and noon supervisors survey the campus to ensure facilities
 
remain safe and clean. During school 
hours, bathrooms are checked a minimum of three times as a proactive measure to keep facilities stocked, safe and 
sanitary. The day custodian is qualified and equipped to handle most minor repairs the school requires. 
Evening custodial 

department. Staff meetings regarding general maintenance instructions and concerns are held daily before custodians are 
dispatched to their respective site for the evening cleaning. All F&O staff members are required to follow district
-
approved 
cleaning standards which are available for public review at the F&O department.
 
 
Appleby works closely with F&O for larger projects
 
that may require third
-
party contractors, routine facilities
-
maintenance 
projects, special projects and school inspections. Schools are required by state law to report the condition of their facilit
ies.
 
 
F&O employs a work
-
order system to communicate its 
maintenance needs. Teachers and school staff relay safety issues 
and general maintenance needs directly to school office staff who then complete a work order request form. The request 
form is submitted to F&O, which then determines whether site custodial s
taff or the maintenance staff will complete the 
project and how the project will be completed. Non urgent requests are typically fulfilled within 24 hours. Emergency 
situations are regularly resolved in one hour or less by either site or district custodial
 
staff, based upon the nature of the 
situation. All maintenance, custodial and grounds keeping personnel and the principal carry handheld radios to facilitate 
efficient and effective communication for emergencies as well as day to day needs between F&O and
 
school site 
administrators.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education 
population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
a
re aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisf
y the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

intervention of under performing students prior to testing for 
learning disabilities to ensure every student receives the 
instruction and skills necessary to proficiently progress from one grade to the next. All students are mainstreamed in a 
general education classroom and receive instruction based on their learning 
level, Individual Education Plan (IEP) or 
Student Study Team guidelines. Instructional programs are aligned with state and district standards, and teachers use a 
variety of instructional techniques and supplemental instructional materials and programs to d
eliver classroom lessons.

improve
 
both their academics and behavior performance. Intervention strategies during and beyond regular instruction 
include class and grade level intervention time.
