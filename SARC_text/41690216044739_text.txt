Principal's Message
 
Brittan Acres is a spectacular school and community! 
From the beautiful trees to the gardens, the 
outdoor learning spaces, the Nature Park, the reading nooks, and so much more. It is true that we 
take great pride in our physical environment, but the real beauty illuminates through the people, 
including the s
tudents, teachers, support staff, families, and the loving community.
 
 
Brittan Acres offers each learner a balanced instructional program. Students enjoy learning from 
supportive and skillful teachers who expertly guide and nurture them along their develop
mental 
journey. In addition to a strong academic curriculum, students enjoy instruction in Physical 
Education, Music, Library, and lessons from the school counselor. In 2019
-
2020, Brittan Acres 
launched a STEAM program that prepares students to think criti
cally and creatively in exploring 
concepts around BUGS (Better Understanding of Garden Science), Art, Makerspace, and visual and 
performing arts. These thoughtfully designed experiences allow us to support the whole child by 
focusing on all areas of develo
pment: cognitive, physical, social, and emotional.
 
 
Brittan Acres is supported by the leadership of a forward
-
thinking School Board and a progressive 
district office team.  The Board, District, and School are all committed to implementing a bold 
Strategic 
Plan aimed at developing our students to their greatest potential, and cultivating their 
fluency in the 5C's: Critical Thinking & Problem Solving, Communication, Collaboration, Citizenship 
(global and local), and Creativity & Innovation.This innovative and
 
engaging learning experience 
fosters the development of the whole child and ensures that students are well prepared for success 
in the 21st century.
 
 
At Brittan Acres, we are proud to be an inclusive community. It is important to us that all members 
feel 
welcomed, valued, respected, safe, and heard. We listen to each other, value input from 
diverse perspectives, and utilize the skills and talents of our community; thereby, allowing our 
students the opportunity to thrive in the deepest of ways.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

As part of the growth process, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at both the district and individ
ual school sites to 
administrators, teachers, and classified staff.  The district offers two full
-
day staff development days and ei
ght Wednesday afternoon sessions annually, 
where staff members are offered professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Comm
on Core Standards, 
Next Generation Science Standards, Project Based Learning, Readers Wo
rkshop, Writers Workshop, Math in Focus and technology infused instruction 
are being integrated into the curriculum. Teachers also review student data, make timely decisions based in data, and share p
ractical tips and strategies 
with each other, during the
ir collaborative prep and meeting time. This year, we continued coaching and collaboration sessions for teachers during the 
school day. In addition to opportunities through the district, site "Flex Funds"  as well as other targeted budgets are used 
to prov
ide professional 
development to teachers to attend workshops, observe in other classrooms and to collaborate with colleagues. Areas of focus a
re determined by our 
Strategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.

Types of Services 
Funded
 
Our school supports the varying educational needs of students through a variety of means.  Student needs are often identified
 
through teacher referrals 
and the Student Study Team (SST) process on campus.  Based upon identified needs, varying levels 
of differentiation, accommodations, supports, models 
and programming are implemented. These include Response to Instruction and Intervention supports, English Language learners s
upports and services, 
intensive literacy support as well as accommodations and
 
services through Section 504 plans and Special Education.  Services always keep in mind the 
least restrictive environment and range from collaboration and consultation with specialists, to push in support and small gr
oup or individual pull

interventio
n services.
