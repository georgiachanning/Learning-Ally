I


are very proud of Mecca  Elementary School and welcome this 
opportunity to tell you more about us. Our main objective with this report card is to inform the 
community about learning conditions and progress being made at Mecca School.
 
 
The Mecca Elementary 
School staff, both certificated and classified, are dedicated to serving the 
school and the community. Our curriculum continues to improve and align with the California 
Common State Standards.  We continue implementing our math program, Go Math. We are 
con
tinuing our plan to improve the development of our English language learners and have begun 
to use English 3D for our long
-
term English users in grades 5 and 6. We are also implementing 
Project Moving Forward for our students in TK
-
3rd grade. We have retur
ned to early release 
Wednesdays and use this time to collaborate. It is during this collaboration time, known as 
Professional Learning Community (PLC) time, that our staff is able to review student data, set goals, 
discuss best teaching practices, and plan
 
lesson delivery that is systematic and rigorous.
 
 
We continue to integrate technology into our daily instruction to enhance lesson delivery and 
student learning. The goal of integrating technology into the lessons is to maintain engagement for 
all student
s and provide a medium through which our students can demonstrate understanding by 
doing so in a manner that modifies and redefines the learning that is taking place. All classrooms 
have iPad carts with iPads assigned to each student.
 
 
We will continue to 
offer parent workshops geared towards continuing to prepare our parents to 

students will succeed in moving forward in all aspects of their development. It is e
qually important 
for parents to be active in the recognitions their child may be a recipient of, and therefore we invite 
parents to participate when their child is recognized at our Student of the Month assemblies and 
other types of celebratory events. Let

goals!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educatio
nal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, d
ata reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.g
ov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community
 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Campus 
Supervision
 
 
School administration and teaching staff place a high priority on providing adequate adult supervision on campus before, duri
ng, and after school. As 
students arrive on campus each morning, the following individuals are strategically assigned 
to designated entrance areas and the playground: the 
principal, yard duty supervisors, and assistant principal. During recess, ten yard duty supervisors, the principal, and the a
ssistant principal supervise 
playground activity. Yard duty supervisors, the p
rincipal, and the assistant principal monitor lunch time activity in the cafeteria and on the playground. 
At the end of the day when students are dismissed, the principal, teachers, the assistant principal, and two yard duty superv
isors monitor student 
beh
avior to ensure a safe and orderly departure. Mecca Elementary School is a closed campus. During school hours, all visitors m

office and wear identification badges while on school grounds.
 
 
The Comprehensive School Safety Plan wa
s developed for Mecca Elementary School in collaboration with local agencies and the district office to fulfill 
Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dange
rous pupil procedur
es, 
disaster response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code
