Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

At KIPP, constant communication between the school and home are encouraged and facilitated. Parents are involved in 
planned parent nights as well as parent/teach

strategies to support their child at home. By staying committed to open communication with the parents, it helps provide 
the proper support that KIPP students need in order for them to b
e successful.
 
 
In an effort to develop the best possible relationships with the community that we serve, we supply all of our teachers 
with cellular phones in order to maintain open communication with families. On the first day of school, parents will be 
g
iven the cellular phone number of all staff members and will be encouraged to use it whenever they need clarification 

 
 
Parents participate in family meetings to recei

writing and mathematical skills at home, as well as financial planning sessions. Parents are engaged annually regarding 

e Dashboard and the Local Control and Accountability Plan. 
Other opportunities for parent involvement include newsletters, local field trips and end of year trips, and fun events such 
as picnics and dances.

At KIPP, the School Leader sets the tone and develop the conditions under which staff members become the keepers of 

fostering 
a positive campus culture, sharing the best instructional practices, and encouraging individual teacher growth.
 
 
Beginning in staff orientation before school begins, the School Leader ensures that teachers fully understand and support 

s mission, goals, and basic values, emphasizing a rigorous, standards
-
based college preparatory program. This 
orientation involves specific activities designed to align the staff and foster teamwork and constant learning while allowing
 
staff to understand 
the detailed intricacies of the school culture. As part of the learning and team
-
building process, staff 

 
includes workshops around
 
data
-
driven instruction, backwards planning model, and building positive relationships with 
students. In addition, staff is trained in various teaching strategies to ensure that all students are provided with multiple
 
avenues to access the curriculum.
 
 
Du
ring the school year, staff development continues through 5 professional development days, weekly staff meetings,
