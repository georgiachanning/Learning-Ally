About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Rosemary Kennedy Elementary School, built in 1999, is located on 10 acres and its 
square footage totals 57,142.  The school has 27 permanent classrooms, 
three portable classrooms, five sets of restrooms, one computer lab, one staff lounge, one staff work room, one library, one 
music room, one

going campus improvements and maintenance ensure facilities are up to date and 
provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Alvord Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.
  
To assist in this effort, the district uses a facility 
survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC.  Results of this survey are available in the school office or at
 
the district.  In addition, district 
maintenance staff makes repairs nece
ssary to keep the school in good repair and working order. A district
-
wide work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and to prioritize repairs.

The school is cleaned on a regular basis with a day custodian and evening custodians who work with
 
the principal to develop a cleaning schedule to 
maintain a clean and safe environment for all students before, during, and after the instructional day.  Deferred Maintenance
 
projects planned for this 
school year include repair, repaving and re
-
striping of
 
the staff parking lots and blacktop on the school playground. Additionally, 18 trees were planted 
on school grounds in September as part of a school sponsored campus beautification project.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the St
ate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populati
on and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in 
the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for
 
statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in
 
the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
