By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Castille Elementary School, our mission is to foster a safe
 

academic and social needs are cultivated, and students are accepting, respectful, and kind. Utilizing the common core 
state standards, educators facilitate innovative learning experiences which promote 
collaboration, critical thinking, 
creativity, and communication. Staff, parents, and the community work in partnership to prepare our students to be 21st
-
century global learners.
 
 
Castille Elementary School opened its doors in September 1975 to 152 student
s in kindergarten through sixth grades. Due 

the early 1990s, the student enrollment soared to well over 900 students. As one of 56 
schools in the Capistrano Unified 
School District, Castille currently enrolls 575 students in a typical middle class community. We serve neighborhoods 
adjacent to the school and to the north, including the Canyon Crest development, as well as to the south 
surrounding 
Newhart Middle School. The majority of the residences in the school communities are single
-
family detached homes and 
a few apartment dwellings. There is a blended state funded/fee
-
based preschool on site as well as a YMCA before and 
after schoo
l program. Castille is also home to a specialized structured program for students with autism as their primary 
disability.
 
 
At Castille, we are proud of our students and their behavior. High standards and expectations are set both academically 
and behavior
ally. Students and teachers follow clear standards of behavior through a school wide discipline plan. The 
discipline plan is reviewed with students and parents at the beginning of each school year with a focus on anti
-
bullying. 
Character development and th


building sound character in students and 
guides them to make good choices. The program focuses on twelve character 
traits: Responsibility, Respect, Thankfulness, Caring, Perseverance, Unity, Integrity, Service, Moral Courage, Citizenship, 
Fairness, and Self
-
Control. In addition to providing our s
tudents with a safe and orderly environment, we place a strong 
emphasis on the recognition of student achievement, participation in academic competition, citizenship, community 
service, and positive character development.
 
 
Castille Elementary School offers
 
many exciting learning experiences and research
-
based instructional programs for 
children. We provide effective interventions and enrichment for students during WIN time (What I Need) and offer after 
school homework help during the week for select student
s. Our PTA provides enrichment in art and music, science field 
trips and assemblies, and other programs interwoven in a student's day. Through the combined efforts of an innovative 
staff, active PTA, involved parents, and broad
-
based community support, the

Our goal is to challenge each student to progress in the state and district standards to achieve academic excellence. We 
facilitate an active and supportive learning environment by collaboration and by ongoing evaluation of s
tudent work and 
assessment results. Learning is stimulated by problem solving, critical thinking skills, and by opportunities for student 
choice through differentiation.  As a STEAM focus school, science, math, technology, and the arts are woven throughout
 

 
scientists at universities and time in our Innovation and Robotics Labs. All students have access to technology both in the 
class
rooms and in a computer lab. Teachers share their expertise with students after school by offering challenging math 
and engineering classes, including competitions and FSEA (Future Scientists and Engineers of America). We are a 21st 
Century Learning Collab
orative.
 
 
At Castille we foster a partnership of school, home, and the community through ongoing communication, an extraordinary 
number of parent volunteers and community events. All students, teachers and parents work together for student success.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
This school has 24 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a library, an innovation lab, a computer lab, 2 music rooms, YMCA 
portables, and an administration building. The main campus was built in 1975. The building was reconfigured in 2002, 
adding permanent walls and new air conditioning units.
 
Portable classrooms were added in 1998 to accommodate 
increased enrollment.
 
 
The district maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair are completed in a 
timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure servi
ces and emergency repairs are given high priority. We recently 
had the shade structures rebuilt in the lunch areas, new concrete poured on the back playground, and fresh paint around 
the front of the school. We are fortunate to have a custodial staff that 
regularly inspects the school's grounds and alerts 
administration of needed repairs and maintains a safe, clean, orderly campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At our school, parent 
participation is evidenced through an extraordinary volunteer program. Parents/grandparents 
provide volunteer hours in the classrooms, assisting teachers with clerical work, and work with small groups of students 
each year at Castille. Our very supportive 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) works hand
-
in
-
hand with the school to provide 
funds and programs, which further enrich the school experience for our students. Examples of some of the parent 
supported activities include curriculum
-
based assemblies and fiel
d trips, art and music programs, an after school running 
club, and an annual talent show. Our STEAM program is funded through our PTA as well and includes the support of our 
Innovation Lab and Science Aide. Tens of thousands of hours are logged each year b
y our supportive volunteer community 
members.
 
We are also fortunate to have a strong volunteer base from the local high schools and boy and girl scout troops. Students 
involved in NHS and CSF volunteer after school to help tutor students needing extra supp
ort and our scouts perform 
various community service projects throughout the year, including several Eagle Scout projects. Additionally, several of 
our parents own companies that support our school through donations and their time.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and 
strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engag
e students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vis
ion 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is m
ulti
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 
classroom. In addi

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to 
improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instruc
tional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpos
e of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for
 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action 
plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.

Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the e
xamination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

sional collaboration.  All collaborative teams utilize Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  Thes
e embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching with
in the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through t
heir participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
