School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Flora Vista Elementary School, recognized four times as a California Distinguished School by the California Department of 
Education, is one of nine award
-
winning elementary schools located in the Encinitas Union Sc

emphasis on Leadership in Civics & Science prepares students to be successful and contributing members of the rapidly 
evolving world in which they live.  We were the only California elementary school to be honored with the 2019
 
Civic 
Learning Awards of Excellence, and were a recipient of the CA Golden Bell Award for our preschool learning program.  At 

which the pr
ocess skills of Design Thinking & Research drive the teaching & learning that connects the content areas 
(including Engineering, Arts, Math, and Science). Technology is used by all students in that process, as they access and 
produce content in a 1:1 iPad 
environment, and an emphasis on information literacy threads throughout all content areas.  
Our students have the opportunity to learn in environments ranging from our school garden to our EUSD Farm Lab satellite 
campus, all supported by an energetic and p
assionate staff.  To support the development of the whole child, students 
participate in yoga and health & wellness lessons, and consultants provide supplemental instruction in the arts/music, 
science, and physical education.
 
 
Our school is nestled in the 
heart of the beautiful and family
-
friendly Village Park area, serving approximately 460 students 
in kindergarten through sixth grade.  Due in large part to our very active, supportive, and fun PTA, Flora Vista has the feel
 
of a true neighborhood school.  O
ur community actively supports Walk and Bike to School Days, and the concept of "Safe 
Routes to School" for pedestrians and bicycle riders.
