About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consis
tent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more informatio
n about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school prin
cipal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Central Unified Schools maintain current and standards
-
aligned instructional materials in good repai
r, for all students. Materials are locally adopted and 
reflect programs currently approved by the State Board of Education. All materials currently adopted reflect the most recent 
SBE adoptions and support 
the current California Frameworks.
 
 
Every student,
 
including English Learners, Special Education, and other special populations have their own textbook. In the case of class se
ts, those sets 
augment individual texts that have been issued to individual students. These class sets are made based on a commitm
ent of the district administration 
and the governing board and are not the product of any state requirement.
 
 
All instructional materials are subject to a school and district review process. Materials may be piloted and all materials t
hat are 
selected and 
recommended for local adoption are reviewed by teachers, administration, and any parents who wish to review the materials. Th
e Central Unified Board 
of Trustees reviews and adopt based on the recommendation of the district adoption committees 
and Educational Services.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Prio
rity: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the
 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eli
gible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement 
(Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Steinbeck utilizes a variety of strategies to 
encourage community and parental involvement. The Annual Title I, and quarterly SSC meetings provide an 
opportunity for parents to receive training, gain an understanding of how to maintain high expectations, and develop a common
 
vision. The role of the 
Sc
hool Site Council is to assist with the development of and recommend a 
School Plan
 
for student achievement. The School Site Council, following 
approval of a 
School Plan
 
for student achievement by the school district governing board, shall have on
-
going res
ponsibility to review with the principal, 
teachers, and other personnel the implementation of the school improvement program and to assess periodically the effectivene
ss of such program. 
Modifications or any improvement to the plan or budget shall be devel
oped, recommended, and approved or disapproved in the same manner. The 
primary task of the SSC is to ensure that the school is continually engaged in identifying and implementing curriculum and in
structional practices that 
result in both strengthening the 
core academic program and ensuring that students have access to success in that program. A Home School Compact is 
reviewed annually. The signed compact underscores the importance of education to each student and provides the roles and resp
onsibilities of t
eachers, 
students, and parents. An active English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), comprised of parents and staff, offer ideas and m
akes recommendations 
regarding our English Learner program.
 
 
Parent Education is offered during the year for parents to ma
ke a partnership between the school and the home. The parents become directly involved 
with the improvement of student achievement. The Steinbeck campus is in constant use after normal school hours for community 
meetings, recreational

School Safety Plan
 
An Emergency Response Plan was developed by Steinbeck School and has been prepared in compliance with Central Unified School 
District Governing 
Board Policy and California Administrative Code, T
itle 5, California Education Section 560, which requires all public schools, kindergarten through 
community college, to have written emergency response plans which will be reviewed at least annually by the local governing b
oard. The plan was 
developed in c
ooperation with state, county, city, and district civil emergency response staff, and they have approved it. Cooperation with
 
these agencies 
is essential in times of an emergency. The plan is devoted to the welfare and safety of the students of Steinbeck S
chool during school hours. It includes 
a procedure whereby the school could be used, under disaster conditions, as a community resource for the care of people. The 
major objectives of 
emergency response procedures are to save lives and protect property in 
the event of a disaster. The School Safety Plan has been developed with these 
objectives in mind. The administration and staff take great pride and effort to ensure that all buildings, halls, and grounds
 
are clean, safe and functional. 
Steinbeck participat
es in the district's School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds to assist the school district w
ith 
expenditures for major repair or replacement. Two
-
way radios have been provided to staff.  This communication system is an esse
ntial component of 
the plan. Drills are conducted on a regular basis.  The Steinbeck safety plan is reviewed with staff, students, and parents e
ach year. The Safety Plan was 
updated and reviewed with staff on September 9, 2019, and approved by the School S
ite Council on December 5, 2019.
