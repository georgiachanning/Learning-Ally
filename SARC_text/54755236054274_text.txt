About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

-
20)
 
Porterville Unified School District held a Public Hearing 
on September 12, 2019 and determined that each school has sufficient and good quality textbooks, 
instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All stu
dents, including English Learners,
 
are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.

School Facility Conditions and P
lanned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Roche Avenue School was originally constructed in 1919 and modernized in the early 1990s. A kindergarten facility was added t
o the campus in 2003. 
During winter 2007, new Kindergarten playground equipment was installe
d and sidewalks were added between the playground and classrooms in order 
to increase handicap accessibility. Construction of two new classrooms with attached student bathrooms were just completed in
 
2014. Additional 
playground equipment was installed in 2
014 as well, which includes a rock climbing wall. A new kindergarten playground structure was added in 2019.
 
 
The campus is currently comprised of 19 classrooms (including portables), a resource room/staff lounge, a library, one readin
g lab, a cafeteria, o
ne 
playground, and the main office. The chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection, provided by 
the district on July 2019. The 
Category and Ranking Totals received are indicated by a "Good" rating of 98.27%. Most of the stru
ctural issues that are in question are from chipping 
paint on one door frame, a few discolored ceiling tiles and weather stripping missing on one door.  A work order has been gen
erated to replace all 
damaged or missing ceiling tiles, repair painted areas a
nd install weather stripping.

The SARC provides the followi

Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Parent & Community Involvement
 
 
Parents are elected to our School Site Council (SSC) and English Learn
er Advisory Committee (ELAC) where they participate in needs assessments and 
decision making to improve the education of our students. Parents play an active role in the community and at the school site
 
by assisting with special 
activities, fundraising and
 
attending parent education/information meetings such as Back to School Night, Fall Festival, Coffee with the Principal, Open 
House, parent conferences, themed Family Fun Nights, and Book Fairs. Parents are encouraged to help in the classrooms, with s
chool
 
activities, and field 
trips.

The SARC provides the following information rele

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of our students and staff are primary concerns at Roche Avenue Ele
mentary School. Supervising our students on campus before and after 
school, during recesses and in our classrooms is a team responsibility. Our campus is completely fenced and locked for studen
t and staff safety during 
the school day.  Teachers, supervisor
y and support staff, along with our administrators enforce a zero tolerance for bullying. Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (P.B.I.S.) structures a strong platform for behavioral expectations. Our HERO Card (Honorable, Eng
aged, Respectful and 
Outstanding) incentive program promotes consistent reminders to meet those expectations.  Bright yellow vests identify our ya
rd and campus 
supervisors. All visitors must sign in at the front office and receive proper authorization to be on school grounds. 
Visitors are asked by the school site 
staff to display their pass at all times. For the safety of our students, all volunteers are fingerprinted and cleared throug
h the Department of Justice. 
Appointments are made with the school secretary for volunteer fi
ngerprinting.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was most recently reviewed in Fall 2019 by the Safety Committee. Key elements of the plan focus o
n emergency preparedness. 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous 
materials and state earthquake standards. Emergency drills are
