School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

It is my pleasure to make our School Accountability Report Card available to the community. I hope that you will be pleased 
with the many successes and celebrate with us the promising future in store for students attending Neil Arms
trong School. 
We acknowledge all students, parents, staff, and community members who have made it their mission to promote the 

 
 
Neil Armstrong School, a California Distinguished School, a Gold Ribbon School and most recently a PBIS Silve
r award 

educational program within a safe and secure environment. We feel that this will lead students to successful, productive, 
and fu
lfilling lives. The school program is implemented by a dedicated, experienced and highly trained staff of 
professionals. Each teacher possesses a California teaching credential, and a large percentage of the teaching staff holds

Cynthia Sanchez Principal
 
 
As a member of Cluster 4 schoo
ls, we embrace the vision to provide an educational experience that assists students in 
reaching their maximum academic potential, affording them the opportunity to attend any higher learning institution of 
their choice, and encouraging all students to be 
contributing, responsible citizens within a culturally diverse, democratic 
society. This vision reflects the goals and objectives of parents, staff, and community.
 
 
School Mission Statement and Goals
 
Our shared school mission holds that all children are un
ique and recognizes that all students can learn with the support 
of both teachers and parents. We know that students have different learning styles. Good teaching incorporates 
sequential and meaningful lessons with differentiated instruction and pacing as 
well as opportunities for reteaching and 
remediation when necessary.
 
 
As part of cluster four schools, we are committed to maintaining an atmosphere in which students develop the desire to 
learn by working in partnership with parents, staff, and community.
 
Learning to use new technology, as an aid in critical 
problem solving and information access is an important part of the ongoing comprehensive teaching and learning across 
the curriculum, which we must constantly keep in mind.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the district are 
in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Staff is trained yearly on emergencies 
and a 
disaster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. All buildings within the district 
are in compliance with state earthquake standards. Teachers are part of the emergency/disaster committee.  This 
committee updates our suppli
es, communicates with principal to schedule trainings for both staff and parents, as well as 
insures that all staff know what plans A, B and C are during and emergency.
 
 
A discipline policy may be found at each school and seeks to insure a safe and orderly
 
environment for students and staff. 
A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes policies on disaster preparedness, student discipline, the components 
of a safe and orderly school environment, suspension/expulsion procedures, safety, child abuse r
eporting procedures, 
student dress codes, and student and staff sexual harassment.  Every staff member is trained yearly on sexual harassment 
and mandated reporter policies.  These dates are found on school calendar.
