About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for En
glish language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students may participate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Universi
ty of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our success is built on a foundation of strong family and community involvement.  We have an active Parent Teacher Organizati
on (PTO) that plans and 
funds school
-
wide events.  This supports a climate that celebrates f
amily, honors culture and respects a community of differences by harnessing the 
energy and resources to ensure student success.  Creating a strong home to school partnership has created a trusting and nurt
uring learning environment 
that helps Madison work 
to support each student's potential.  Our parent empowerment has helped bridge the language and cultural differences that 
often keeps parents from understanding standards, curriculum, instruction, and assessment.  We support parents in their abili
ty to adv
ocate for their 
children now and throughout their careers in public education.  In addition to our JM PTO, we develop parent leadership and e
mpowerment in order to 
ensure alignment of support through the San Leandro Unified School District strategic plan. 
 
Our parents are active and involved in a wide variety of 
district committees and initiatives.
 
 
James Madison Elementary School actively develops partnerships with local businesses, community organizations, and the "SLED"
 
San Leandro Education 
Foundation.

Professional development at James Madison is aligned with the SLUSD Strategic Plan and supports beginning and veteran teacher
s in all subjects and 
instructional practices. James Madison Elementary School staff is actively participating in the district init
iatives and harnessing the district instructional 
coaches to help effectively transition to 21st century skills and Common Core Standards.  Staff development for beginning tea
chers is enhanced through 
BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Suppor
t Providers. We are most proud of our ongoing work with Project Based Learning Consultation 
and Positive Behavior Intervention and Support.  District committees and action teams also allow for collaboration between te
achers.  Minimum days 
and release time 
assures ongoing personal and professional growth.   Additional resources are earmarked for outside conferences and workshops 
to 
support teacher growth and innovation.
 
 
The district supports staff development through three Professional Growth Days each year
.  In addition our teachers are released to pursue ongoing 
growth and development to ensure they remain inspired and excited about teaching at James Madison Elementary School.
