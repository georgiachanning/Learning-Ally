Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of 
study.

Parents are an extremely important part of California Virtual Academy @ Kings (CAVA @ Kings). Parents will help us to 

parents of CAVA @ 

parents will also serve as mentors to new families and families that are struggling with technology complications or
 
curriculum problems. The mentors support and encourage families in learning to navigate the day
-
to
-
day management of 
home education. Parents are given an opportunity to make their voices heard (both online and offline) about their likes 
and dislikes about
 
the school. Some parents will be asked to give critiques and/or testimonials about the program.
 
 

by researching our program and choo
sing to enroll their child in our school. Parents attend a registration conference and 
agree to the enrollment requirements.  By completing these steps, parents show they are committed to being an active 
member of their student's education team in our prog
ram.
 
 
Parental involvement is enhanced by the fact that the school will be educating not only students, but also its parents. 
Parents will be trained on the K12 instructional system, and are taught how to be effective instructional coaches under 
the guidan
ce of highly qualified and certificated teachers. Many parents will learn how to use computers for the first time, 
become expert e
-
mail and Internet users and will be exposed to a content
-
rich curriculum, including classic literature, a 
comprehensive re
-
te
lling of the story of history, various musical genres, and great works of art.  Parents will have a rich 
social networking experience with the school Facebook site.  We have many resources available both online and offline.  
There are ongoing parent/learni
ng coach training opportunities through K12 Speaker Series, Online School tutorials, K12 
Parent Network, School Effectively at Home workshops and staff
-
presented learning coach and parent education 
workshops and orientations.  We have a detailed Parent Stu
dent Handbook, Special Education Handbook, and CAVA @ 
Kings New Parent Resource Guide.  We have a Parent Mentor program to provide the ultimate one on one experience for 
learning coaches who would like a mentor to support them in their journey.  In additio
n, parents and students alike will 
find many opportunities for outings and college tours, where learning occurs outside the classroom with opportunities to 
connect with other students and learning coaches.

Middle school teachers offer our middle school pa
rents Parent Education sessions.  These sessions provide support to our 
parents in understanding and working with students in the common core curriculum for mathematics and English language 
arts (writing strategies, reading comprehension, and grammar). In 
addition, the high school also offers Parent Education 
sessions covering various topics, including helping students develop good study habits and how to support high schoolers 
in their education.
 
 
Parents are actively encouraged to participate in CAVA @ Ki
ngs planning, organizational, Board of Directors, and other 
meetings. They are also encouraged to offer ideas and planning assistance with outings, social events, and other outings.  
We have parent representatives on the CAVA @ Kings school board and invit
e all parents and learning coaches to 
participate in stakeholder surveys and quarterly stakeholder meetings.  We offer community
-
building at the school and 
state level, as well as the national level with other virtual academies.
 
 
The CAVA @ Kings community
 
thrives when parents discover the resource that best meets their needs.  We have many 
layers of support in place, as well as opportunities for parent leadership.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The California Virtual Academy takes staff and student health and safety seriously. Because the school is a virtual school, 
there is no need for a school building where classes are held on a daily basis. The administrative office currently complies 
with al
l ADA, OSHA, and local health and safety requirements. The school has obtained all necessary permits for these 
offices including a building and fire marshal inspection and/or a certificate of occupancy.
 
 
Immunization forms and other pertinent medical recor
ds are kept (confidentially) on file by the school administration. 
Parents are expected to ensure that their children obtain proper immunizations prior to matriculating pursuant to Chapter 
1 (commencing with §120325) of Part 2 of Division 105 of the Health
 
and Safety Code. The school may exempt students 
from enrolling who are not properly immunized pursuant to §48216 (a
-
c) of the Education Code. Those parents who are 
having difficulty obtaining immunizations for their children will be provided information o
n where to get immunized in 
their community.
 
 
All pertinent and required health and safety documentation is collected at time of hire or enrollment, as appropriate. 

he Simi Valley, CA office. Copies 
of employee records and student records can be made available at the request of the School District.
 
 
The school has drafted health and safety procedures that the school will follow to ensure the health and safety of pupil
s 
shall which include compliance with the criminal background check requirements described in Sections 44237 and 45125.1 
of the Education Code.

After reviewing the CA State Dashboard achievement data, high quality instruction, especially focused in mathematics, is 
the major area of professional development for CAVA @ Kings staff. All teachers participate in beginning of year 
professional developme
nt day, monthly professional development meetings, monthly meetings with their Instructional 
Coach, and a teacher collaboration day each semester. A significant amount of time in August before students return is 
allotted for training and review. The primar
y focus of professional development is on quality instruction in an online setting 
to ensure teachers are implementing standards
-
based lessons, making lessons relevant and interesting, involving students 
in practice, checking for understanding and assessin
g mastery in real time. Professional development also continues to 
focus on teaching at deeper levels of knowledge to further critical thinking. Professional development is delivered through 
recorded trainings, in person meetings, and online meetings.
 
 
In 
addition to training, we have implemented a comprehensive instructional coaching program. Every teacher is assigned 
an instructional coach who observes them at least one time each month. Coaches and teachers meet following the 
observed session in a 'grow' 
session during which goals are set and progress is discussed. The combination of our 
professional development program and instructional coaching allows teachers to learn instructional strategies in a broad 
setting and tailor to their ability and experience
 
for continued growth. Teachers also meet monthly with their regional 
lead for a data conference and review student progress on specific master standards.
