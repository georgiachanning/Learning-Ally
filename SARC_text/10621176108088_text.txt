Welcome to Fancher Creek Elementary School, home of the Falcons!
 
 
Our annual School Accountability Report Card (SARC) allows us to paint a picture of our special 
school. What we hope emerges is a picture of a school with a commitment to excellence; a faculty 
that is professionally skilled and personally committed to meet
ing the learning needs of all 
students; and a student body that, as a whole, is well
-
disciplined, motivated, has a great amount of 
pride and works as a family. All of us see the relationship between school and home to be a key 
indicator of student success,
 
and we strive to build strong relationships to provide a seamless 
system of support for our students. Our school staff welcomes parent and community participation 
through a variety of ways. Parents are welcome to visit or work in the classroom and are str
ongly 

 
 
As a school, we continue to align our resources and funds to ensure all students have the 
opportunity to master their grade
-
level standards. Students are at the center of everything we do 
at Fancher Creek, and the dedication and tireless efforts of our sta
ff has resulted in increased 
student achievement. The work of our staff combined with the support of our parents and 
determination of our students has reaped many rewards. In the past two years, Fancher Creek has 
earned the California State Distinguished S
chool Award, California Gold Ribbon School Award, Title 
I Academic Achievement Award, and made the Campaign for Business and Education Excellence 
(CBEE) Honor Roll. This is a remarkable feat and a reflection of the great parents, students and staff 
at Fanc
her Creek Elementary School.
 
 
While the SARC serves as a vehicle of communication, providing practical information relative to 
the educational programs at Fancher Creek, we encourage our community to participate in our 
parent meetings and school events to 
be an active participant in the educational process. Four 
major forums are used throughout the school year to gather input and feedback as well as 
communicate school news. They are the quarterly parent School Assessment Review Team (SART) 
meetings, English
 
Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) meetings, the School Site Council (SSC), and 
the monthly Parent
-
Teacher Club (PTC) meetings. We encourage all parents to utilize these forums 
and to communicate directly with the school at (559) 327
-
6700.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Erin
 
Parker
 
Principal

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Cont
rol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to addres
s 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Fancher Creek has been a key educational institution for 29 years. We pride 
ourselves in the cleanliness of our grounds and the maintenance of our 
buildings. Our custodial staff, consisting of one daytime custodian and two afternoon/evening custodians, performs basic clea
ning operations in every 
classroom and other school faciliti
es every day. Students and teachers consistently assist with keeping the grounds clear of litter.
 
 
A committee of parents inspects the cam
-
pus grounds and restrooms on a regular basis to provide feedback to our student body. When asked to grade 
how well th

t
-
wide, 97 percent 

unity awareness, school pride and an 
open
-
campus policy, we hope to keep vandalism and burglary to an all
-
time low.
 
 
The latest improvement projects at Fancher Creek were completed in November 2016. The project included:
 

 
New parent drop
-
off and pick
-
up dri
ve with updated landscaping and irrigation
 

 
Interactive projectors with inte
-
grated, multimedia sound in all permanent classrooms
 

 
Updated wide
-
screen projector and projector screen in the multipurpose room
 

 
New sound system in the multipurpose room
 

 
New readi
ng room in the library
 

 
Main office expansion to include a conference room and additional office space
 

 

 
Fancher Creek currently has an enrollment of 796 students. With 24 permanent
 
classrooms and the addition of 15 portable classrooms, the school has 
sufficient classroom space to accommodate the enrollment. The multipurpose room serves the student body not only for lunchtim
e, but also houses 
athletic programs, drama presentations an
d awards ceremonies. The library is sufficiently stocked with many types of books and resources. There is a 
social
-
emotional support lab on campus that was created when we established a 1:1 ratio for technology that eliminated a need for a 
Technology Lab.

Ongoing professional development helps our staff hone our craft by learning new 
strategies and techniques to best serve our students. Keeping up to 
date on the latest educational research and best practices helps us grow as educators and allows us to respond appropriately 

During the 2018
-
19 school year, our sta
ff participated in on
-
site in
-
services, workshops, grade
-
level meetings and staff meetings centered on the needs 
of our students based on assessment data. Topics of focus for the up
-
coming year will be Professional Learning Communities (PLC), Multi
-
Tiered 
System 
of Support (MTSS), Social
-
Emotional Support for Students, Math Problem Solving, Building Internal Coherence and writing common formative 
assessments. As part of our Internal Coherence work, our staff is learning about justifying answers through writ
ten responses across the curriculum. We 
hope to refine that shared learning by developing a clear progression of justification skills from transitional kindergarten 
to sixth grade. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, our team will be participating in staff d
evelopment sessions dedicated to the new math curriculum pilot and a continuation of our 
Multi
-
Tiered System of Support (MTSS) implementation.
 
 
The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best inst
ruction, mastery learning, multi
-
tiered system 
of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.
 
 
In the 2019
-
20 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days f
or certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional 
development opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after
-
school workshops were also 
offered throughout the school year.
 
 
One 
hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty
-
five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching 
through the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site
-
based training and dist
rict sponsored training that included:  
curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi
-
tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.

District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality learning opportunities and access to the co
re curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additiona
l assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom program (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning gaps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff dev
elopment.   Staff development 
activit
ies are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to challen
ge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
