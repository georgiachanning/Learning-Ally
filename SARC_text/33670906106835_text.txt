By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Camino Real Elementary School's Mission is to enhance experiences for all students.  Everyday, when students walk on 
campus, they are challenged to be the best student they can be.
 
 
Camino Re
al houses approximately 815 students in grades TK
-
6.  It boasts the highest assessment scores within the Jurupa 
Unified School District and is a Title 1 Academic Achievement Award winning school.
 
 
Most of Camino's students come from moderate
-
income homes. 
 
Approximately 15% of our students are bused to and 
from school, while others walk with their parents.  Forty percent of our student population participates in the federal Free 
and Reduced Lunch program.  Camino itself, is comprised of 33 classrooms, a mul
tipurpose room, library, and main office.  
Students in grades TK
-
3 maintain a 25:1 student to teacher ratio and grades 4
-
6 maintain a 32:1 student to teacher ratio.
 
 
Camino Real serves a diverse student population, of which ten languages are spoken in the 
homes.  About eighty students 
are identified as English learners, receiving ELD instruction and access to core programs in structured English immersion 
and mainstream classrooms deemed appropriate for their levels of English fluency. In addition, Camino Re
al has over 100 
GATE (gifted and talented) students who received differentiated instruction within the classroom, as well as after school 
enrichment classes.
 
 
Camino Real boasts a high level of parent and community involvement.  We have an active PTA which
 
conducts fundraising 
to support educational experiences for our students, coordinate parent volunteers, and provide activities which extend 
and enhance learning experiences and foster school spirit.  Our Fifth/Sixth Grade Booster Club provides support for
 
sixth 
grade students to participate in science camp and other culminating activities in their final year at Camino Real. Camino's 
GATE Booster provides extended learning opportunities for students who partake in their events.  Our School Site Council 
and 
ELAC committees meet regularly as representatives of the community and school staff to learn about and give input 
into school programs and the development of the School Plan.
 
 
This year Camino Real became a full
-
inclusion school 
-
 
where general and 
special education students are in the general 
education setting together.  The goal of this initiative is to provide all students with the most beneficial educational sett
ing 
and support needed to achieve and succeed.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 27, 2019
 
 
Jurupa Unified School District conducts an evaluation of instructional materials to adopt materials that best meet the 
needs of students. The district conducts adoptions on a districtwide basis. The review process includes a committee of a 
majority of clas
sroom teachers in the appropriate discipline (Education Code Section 60210). In addition, all instructional 
materials are in compliance with social content standards. When making adoption decisions, the adoption committee uses 
the content standards, the cu
rriculum frameworks, the State Board of Education
-
adopted evaluation criteria, and the 
reports on each adoption as resources. The final decision for selecting and recommending textbook adoptions is with the 
adoption committee. The most recently adopted tex
tbooks were selected from the state
-
approved list.
 
 
All students, including English learners, have standards
-
aligned textbooks checked out to them, to use in class and to take 
home, in each of the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics
, science and history/social science; 
foreign language and health; visual and performing arts; and science laboratory equipment for grades nine through twelve 
as appropriate.
 
 
Elementary students receive core curriculum textbooks on the first day of enroll
ment.  Middle school and high school 
students receive textbooks checked out to them at registration days a few days before the first day of school.  All students 
enrolling after the first day of school have core curriculum textbooks checked out to them by 
the Library Clerk on their 
first day of enrollment.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our custodial staff, consisting of one daytime custodian and two evening custodians, perform basic cleaning operations in 
every classroom on a regular basis. In the fall of 2003 we ad
ded a shade structure with tables on our playground to provide 
a cool place for students to rest on hot days. We also added a new bus loop to help ease congestion and improve safety 
in our parking lot. Safety is maintained through the coordination and effo
rts of several different agencies, including the 
local fire department, Keenan and Associates (Administrator of Workers' Compensation), Industrial Indemnity (Liability 
Insurance Carrier), the district safety committee, and our own school custodians.
 
 
Camin
o Real Elementary School in accordance with Senate Bill 187 has safe school strategies that include information on 
the status of school crime and the following elements: Safe school programs; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster 
response procedures; 
suspension and expulsion policies pursuant to Education Code Section 48900, 48915, and 49079; 
the District's Discipline Handbook and Sexual Harassment Policy; our school dress code; and procedures and rules for 
safety on the way to and from school as well 
as during school hours. This plan will be updated every year and approved 
by our School Site Council by March.
 
 
Camino Real practices monthly fire drills. Disaster drills are held twice a year. Our site has emergency water and food 
supplies, blankets, firs
t aid supplies, radios, flashlights, and tools recommended for disaster use.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Camino Real 
Elementary School offers multiple opportunities for parental involvement.
 
 
Camino Real and our PTA strive for involvement and recognition in the Jurupa Community through a number of community 
service events and enrichment opportunities.  PTA supports the s
chool through fundraising, which pays for transportation 
cost for field trips, as well as providing funds for PBIS, AVID; school
-
wide events like the Fall Picnic, assemblies, and Red 
Ribbon Week.
 
 
The Fifth/Sixth Grade Booster Club and GATE Booster Club ar
e made up of parents and teachers.  These clubs support a 
myriad of culminating activities for students in their final years at Camino.  The members of the Booster Clubs support 
fundraising and accounting for student attendance at Sixth Grade Science Camp 
and GATE field trips and activities.
 
 
Our ELAC and School Site Council are very active parent involvement groups who advises the principal on programs and 
services for English Learners, safety, AVID, the school site plan, and the overall success of Camino.
  
ELAC acts in an advisory 
capacity, although It is not a decision making body, is the voice of our English learner community.
 
 
The level of parental involvement at Camino Real is very high and our parent groups work throughout the year to improve, 
expand, and enhance experiences for all Camino students.

Camino Real Elementary School and the Jurupa Unified School District realize the importance of ongoing staff 
development.  Our well
-
trained teachers put their expertise to use with pride; this translates to student learning in a happy 
environment where tea
chers are not only valued but are also our greatest resource.  We are proud of the fact that 100% 
of the teachers at Camino Real Elementary School are fully credentialed.  A majority of our teachers hold masters degrees 
and special certificates, many have 
been master teachers, trainers or mentors, and all continue to participate in ongoing 
staff development.
 
 
Staff development is held regularly to address instructional needs and keep teachers abreast of teaching strategies and 
programs, which are research
-
b
ased and proven to be effective in increasing student academic performance.  Currently, 
all teachers are working in grade level collaborative groups to address the implementation of Common Core Standards 
within the classroom.  Teacher leaders present updat
es at monthly faculty meetings.  In addition, the district Instructional 
Coaches present updates on new curriculum during after
-
school optional workshops.  All teachers attended professional 
development workshops to address the new Common Core Standards in
 
Math and NGSS Science.
 
 
The Jurupa Unified School District is committed to providing high
-
quality, research
-
based professional development to all 
of its teachers, responding to requirements set by CDE.  Staff development continues to focus in the areas of
 
California 
Common Core State Standards for ELA/ELD (RCOE, provider); Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS 

 
JUSD 
Special Education Department, provider);  Balanced Math Program (Leadership and Learning Center training, provider);  
ELA, NGSS S
cience, and Mathematics Units of Study (Leadership and Learning Center Rigorous Curriculum Design 
consultants and Jurupa writing committee teachers, California Science Project, providers); Language! intervention teacher 
training (Voyager Learning consultan
ts, provider); Transitional Kindergarten teacher training (JUSD Education Services 
Professional Development Program, provider); state adopted ELD standards, My Math and Reading ELA/ELD new textbook 
training (McGraw
-
Hill consultants, providers); and GATE te
acher training (Dr. Susan Daniels, The Summit Center, provider); 
an introduction to Chromebook student use through Google Apps for Educators (GAFE, JUSD Technology Department and 
Coaches, presenters); and Growth Mindset lesson design (JUSD Coaches, present
ers).  These trainings provided teachers 
with the skill and tools necessary for implementing high
-
quality instruction to a range of students in our TK
-
12 classrooms.
