By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 

 
facility.
 
 
Lucille J. Smith is a brand new structure. The campus is completely fenced in. Because this is new 
construction, all of the 
classrooms meet the educational demands for electrical, lighting and security measures.
 
 
The school is a closed campus and gates remain locked during school hours. All parents and visitors must check in through 
the office to access
 
the school grounds. Before and after school, and at lunch, adult aides supervise the playgrounds. 
Teachers monitor students at recess.
 
 
Our classrooms, staff rooms, and playgrounds are safe and clean environments for teaching and learning. 
Students have 
access to a large playground with blacktop, grass area, and a modern apparatus. Two full time custodians perform basic 
cleaning operations at our school site. Classrooms are cleaned every other day and restrooms are cleaned daily. 100% of 
the
 
restroom toilets are operational. The District maintenance and grounds departments provide additional services as 
needed. Grounds are maintained weekly.
 
 
The investment through our district to build this beautiful new building was $12,502,731.
 
 
This site 
is scheduled to be repainted using Measure L funding in the summer of 2019.

We have an active PTA, School Site Council, and English Learner Advisory Council.
 
 
Our PTA, headed by President Andrea DeJohn, became established 
and fully functioning during 2006
-
07. The PTA provided 
support for several family night events and helped to give a formal structure for parent volunteers at our new school. The 
PTA needs and welcomes your support. If you would like to know how you could g
et involved in PTA activities, please 
contact Andrea DeJohn through our school office at 310

We welcome the assistance of parent volunteers in the classroom and at other school events. The Smith Parent Volunteer 
Center is supported by Joselyn Gu
erra, Community Liaison.  Our Smith School Site Council, PTA, parent volunteers, and 
the community provide positive support to our school. We create opportunities for parents to engage and learn with their 
children.  We offer Early literacy classes, anti

Number of school days dedicated to Staff 
Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The LESD Education Services team in collaboration with the Language Arts Specialists, Math TOSAs, English Language 
Instructional Resource Teachers and Principals have designed a comprehensive system for 
monthly professional 
development.  All district professional development occurs on Thursdays after school following an early release day.   
Topics are selected based on expressed teacher need and identified student deficiencies.  All professional developme
nt in 
the LESD focuses on meaningful collaboration, developing teacher capacity and the implementation of research based 
practices to support student achievement.
 
 
Professional development focuses on the instructional shifts needed to meet the rigorous dem
ands of the Common Core 
State Standards and the need to support development of academic discourse for all students, with an emphasis on English 
language learners.  All TK
-
5th grade teachers receive professional development support in the areas of social
-
em
otional 
learning, Math warm
-
ups, and integrated ELD. Collaboration time is spent on data analysis and planning in the areas of 
English Language Arts, Math, and ELD. Teachers receive professional development in structured cycles that afford them 
the opportu
nity to learn about a new concept, plan for implementation with their colleagues, practice their learning with 
students, and then come back with their colleagues to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their instructional 
implementation of the new skill
.
 
 
Feedback about the effectiveness of the professional development is regularly collected to assess the effectiveness of the 
program and make changes as needed.  Additionally, site staff members and Educational Services team members regularly 
visit classr
ooms to determine the level of implementation of the professional development focus.
