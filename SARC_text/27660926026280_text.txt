Welcome to La Mesa Elementary School, offering transitional kindergarten through 5th grade. At 
La Mesa Elementary School we have a wonderful community of families and staff 
that work 
together to provide the best educational and social opportunities possible for our children. La Mesa 
students receive a challenging academic program in a beautiful, safe, and welcoming environment. 
La Mesa is a unique school because approximately
 
80% of the student that attend La Mesa come 
from military associated families. Approximately 25 percent of those military associated students 
are internationals thus creating a rich diversity of languages and cultures. At last count we had 
students repres
enting approximately 24 different countries with 24 different languages.
 
 
La Mesa staff members continue to participate in professional development opportunities in the 
areas of instructional strategies, social emotional support and curriculum to ensure st
udents not 
only make continued progress towards meeting the California Common Core State Standard grade 
level requirements but also feel safe and supported.
 
 
Major Achievements
 
 
All of students participate in the district
-
funded music program. TK
-
3 student
s have classroom 
music and the 4th and 5th grade student have band and orchestra. The La Mesa PTA generously 
provided funding for a science lab, computer lab, PE, performing arts, and organized an Art Docent 
Program. DODEA grant funding has provided us wit
h a STEM/Makers space and has also provided 
funding for social/emotional support for students.
 
 
Focus for Improvement
 

 
We will continue to implement strategies that engage students in their learning.
 

 
Teachers will continue to participate in professional dev
elopment opportunities. ( 
Guided Reading, Fountas and Pinel, multiple instructional strategies)
 

 
We will continue to provide support for student and family transitions into our school 
through Anchored for Life, Student 2 Student and PBIS.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on August 2019, and determined that
 
the school had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, incl
uding English learners, are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or i
nstructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the 
school
 
the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made
 
to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for
 
parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of the California Common 
Core standards

aligned textbooks and other instructional materials 
used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Planne
d Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our local scho
ols. The district's newest school was built in 1965, more than 50 years ago, and 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million school 
facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional detai
ls.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online 
supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The impo
rtant purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this 
assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
La Mesa parents are deeply involved in the education of their children, whether in the classr
oom, or at home. The National PTA (Parent Teacher 
Association) previously recognized La Mesa as a School of Excellence for Parent Involvement. Each year parents and volunteers
 
spend thousands hours 
working at La Mesa in different capacities. Contributions 
come by way of parent assist in the classroom,  Art Docents, special events, campus 
beautification, and fund raising. The La Mesa PTA also funds our PE, Science lab, computer lab and contributes to our Visual 
and Performing Arts programs. 
To find out how y
ou can be involved at our school, contact the school office at (831) 649
-
1872 or go to lamesapta.com. Parents also have the opportunity 
to participate in our Parent to Parent program for incoming military families.  Each year we have approximately 80% volu
nteer participation.
 
 
State 
Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The 
safety and well being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District and this s
chool. Under Senate Bill 
187, every school in the district is required to complete (or review and update) a School Safety Plan by M
arch 1 of each year. The plan is reviewed and 
evaluated by the School Safety Planning Committee, the School Site Council, and the school principal before being presented t
o the Board of Education 
for final review and adoption. The approved plans are posted
 
on each school's website, as well as the district website at www.mpusd.net.

Highlight's of this school's plan are detailed below.
 
 
Yard supervisory team, monitors students during morning recess, in the lunchroom, and at lunch recess. All visitors are 
required to sign in and sign out 
at the school office. All volunteers must complete a volunteer orientation and undergo a background check prior to providing 
volunteer service. We 
currently have over 150 highly parent volunteers registered. The school camp
us is locked down 15 minutes after school starts and is opened 15 minutes 
before school is out, limiting access to the school only through the front office.  All gates are locked during the school da
