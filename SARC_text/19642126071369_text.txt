A Message from the Principal
 
At Bragg, our passion is to create an environment that inspires social, emotional, 
and academic growth, and to develop 
global citizens that value themselves and others with compassion and resiliency.  As a staff, we are committed to working 
together to support students, engage parents, and maintain a school environment that is built on r
espect, trust, and care.  
This school year, our main goal is to develop Collective School Efficacy 
-
 
the "art of working together" to ensure the growth 
of our students and to provide a positive, safe, and nurturing school environment and culture where all 
students, parents, 
teachers, and community can thrive.
 
 
Bragg is proud to be designated as a 2018 California Honor Roll School.  This is the eighth year in a row that Bragg has earn
ed 
this prestigious recognition.  We were also recognized by USC as being a
 
"Top Los Angeles Public School for Underserved 
Students

on the California Assessment for Student Performance and Progress 
(CAASPP) in Math.  In 2017, Bragg earned a Golden Bell Award for our Building Bridges Progr
am.  The Building Bridges 
Program is a comprehensive program that provides structures and supports in the following areas: 1) Positive Behavior and 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS), 2) Multi

tiered Support Team, 3) Playworks Program, 4) Professional Devel
opment for 
teachers and staff.  The primary goal of the Building Bridges Program is to achieve academic and social excellence by focusin
g 
on programs and activities on the developmental needs of individual students and the school as a whole.  We have weekl
y 
Student Assemblies where we provide Praise Notes to students who show positive behavior.  We also have Student Awards 
Assemblies where students are recognized for academic and behavioral improvement and achievement, as well as grade 
level attendance.  Th
e entire staff continually reinforces our core values

Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Kind, and Be 
Engaged

into our daily practices and culture.
 
 
Community building at Bragg is an area of focus.  We pride ourselves in providing opportunities to have 
parents and families 
involved in the educational process.  We have the D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students) Program.  Our DOGS supervise school 
events, parking lot control, and they are DOGS for a Day, helping to maintain school safety.  Our PTA is heavily in
volved with 
our school.  They support and organize our Trunk or Treat, Winter Land Family Dinner, the Spring Musical, and Culture Fest, 
among others.  They also provide assemblies for students throughout the school year.  We also have Parenting Workshops 
t
hat are available to all parents.  Parents are also invited to our Peace Picnics several times a year where families come and
 
have a picnic
-
style lunch with their children.
 
 
Bragg also maintains high academic standards for all students.  71/6% of our stude
nts (3rd 
-
 
6th
-
grade students) were 
'At/Above Standard" on the 2018 CAASPP for English Language Arts.  Bragg students increased on the ELA/CAASPP by 7.3 
points in relation to the previous year.  63.9% of our students (3rd 
-

rd" on the 2018

6th grade students) increased by 4.1 points in relation to the previous school year.  
To promote academic success, Bragg promotes a culture of School Collective Efficacy for all teachers.  Teachers ar

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe
r of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student
 
privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent involvement at Bragg Elementary is extremely important and heavily valued at Bragg.  Together, 
as a Bragg Community, students 
-
 
teachers 
-
 
parents 
-
 
and the School work closely together to promote student achievement and school
-
wide success.
 
 
Bragg has a vibrant and involved PTA.  Our PTA provides many school/community events throughout the year (Tr
unk or Treat, Winter Wonderland Family 
Social, Spring Musical, and Culture Fest, among others).  Bragg's PTA also funds all field trips, student assemblies, and the
 
History Walk Walk Through 
Program.  Materials or our art program as well as playground equi
pment is supported by our PTA.  They are also supportive of student incentives and 
classroom materials for all students and teachers.
 
 
Bragg is very proud to have the D.O.G.S. (Dads of Great Students) Program.  The D.O.G.S. provide support and supervision 
to our campus, classrooms, 
and our school/community events.  They also help us maintain the parking
-
valet service before and after school, school improvement projects, and they 
can be a D.O.G.S. for a day.
 
 
Together, as a three part team (school, parents, 
and students) we work closely together to maintain a school that is rooted in Kindness, Respect, 
Responsibility, and Engagement.  Student growth and achievement, both academically and socially, is at the center of our work
 
as a school and 
community.  Bragg
 
hosts several events to promote "involvement and  community."  A few of these are 
-
 
Coffee with The Principal, Trunk or Treat, Peace 
Picnic, Back to School Picnic, Back To School Night, and Open House, among many others throughout the school year.
 
 
The Si
te Council is another important part of our school.  Site Council is an elected group of teachers, parents, and classified em
ployees, who work with 
the principal to develop, review, and evaluate our School Plan and allocate funds accordingly.  The meetings
 
are open to all parents to attend.
