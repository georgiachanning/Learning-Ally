It is the belief of 
Cesar Chavez Elementary School that students can and will excel in an environment 
that is tailored to their evolving needs. Although we recognize our areas of needs and concern, we 
are extremely proud as we strive to meet all academic goals established by 
the district, state, and 
federal government.
 
 
Our hard working staff are both skilled and dedicated to the success of all students. We are 
fortunate to have many experienced and knowledgeable teachers eager to make a difference for 
our students. We believe
 
in a student
-
centered approach, which provides an atmosphere in which 

with this information is to keep our community, and the public in general, well inf
ormed. In 
reflection of that goal, we desire to keep the lines of communication open and welcome any 
suggestions, comments, or questions you may have. It is the opinion of the district and myself in 
particular that a well
-
informed public is vital in contin
uing to advance in an ever
-
evolving world. 
Thank you for helping Cesar Chavez Elementary School change with the times and maintain 
flexibility in this and future generations.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in th
e table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for s
tatistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in t
he test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
