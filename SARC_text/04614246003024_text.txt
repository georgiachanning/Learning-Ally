By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
John McManus Elementary School is located in north Chico a
nd encompasses a large school boundary area.   The student 
composition is a diverse mixture of Caucasian, African American, Latino and Asian students. Thanks to funding from the 
Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), schools, such as McManus, in lower inco
me areas are receiving breakfast and lunch 
at no cost to all enrolled students. The school was expanded significantly in the last two decades  to accommodate 
increases in students living on the north side of town. Campus beautification and site improvement
s continue to happen 
to provide safety and school pride.
 
 
The campus is comprised of approximately 428 Preschool
-
5th grade students.  The campus has one transitional 
kindergarten classes as well as two severely handicapped classes.   McManus also houses 
a state
-
run Preschool and a 
district Preschool Speech program, as well as two district training rooms which are utilized frequently for professional 
development sessions.  It is the vision of the McManus staff to create a high quality learning environment 
and culture 
which creates academic and emotional success for all students. Our mission: The vision of McManus is to be safe, 
respectful, responsible, and hardworking.  McManus will ensure a safe place where both academic and social
-
emotional 
learning is es
tablished and that all students, families, and staff are respected.  In March, 2017, McManus was named a 
KDS (Knowledge Development Site) through the state MTSS (Multi
-
Tiered System of Support) initiative. McManus is 
fortunate to partner with Chico Sunrise
 
Rotary and Grace Community Church.  Through these community partnerships, 
the campus has been able to increase the number of books in our library and provide wonderful family celebrations and 
fundraisers throughout the year.  These connections have also g
ifted us campus beautification and on
-
going teacher /staff 
appreciation throughout the year.  In early 2017, McManus received a Holistic Playground, thanks to support from the 
Rotary during a Recology
-
sponsored campus beautification project..
 
 
McManus pr
ovides a before and after school program for our students.  McManus operates an ASES grant program 
starting for one and one
-
half hour before school and three hours after school.  The grant provides reading and math 
homework support and some tutoring for 89
 
students on a daily basis.  This homework support is also part of the program 
as well as a variety of enrichment and recreation options.   The community
-
based Reading Pals program has approximately 
50 participating students.  For Kindergartners, McManus o
ffers a full
-
day program with a one
-
hour after
-
school program 
free of charge for students and families.   McManus has a total of 12 Chromebook carts which are housed in classrooms 
1st
-
5th grades.  This will make the technology ratio 1:1 on the campus.  McM
anus is also fortunate to have the iReady 
program in both English Language Arts and Math. With the whole child in mind, McManus provides for the emotional 
needs of students by housing one counselor, one Guidance Specialist, and one three
-
day psychologist o
n staff.  This group, 
plus the principal and Targeted Case Manager, make up our site Wellness Team.  The counselor and Guidance Specialist 
support students each day of the week in individual and group counseling sessions, classroom presentations, and suppo
rt 
on the playground.  The school also has an active SBIT Team (Student
-
Based Intervention Team) in which student academic 
progress is carefully monitored and supported.
 
 
Seventeen McManus staff members were gifted the training of Mindfulness Fundamentals 
through the Mindful School 
Program and are implementing a school
-
wide system of mindful practices with our students. Additionally, all teachers on 
site have access to the Inner Explorer program which is a series of daily 5
-
to 10 minute audio
-
guided mindful
 
practices. 
PBIS (Positive
-
Based Intervention System) is a cornerstone of our program at McManus.

Updated and readily available resources are important if students are to perform at their best in class. The State of 
California adopts textbooks that meet quality standards established by the State Board of Educa
tion. The Chico Unified 
School District selects textbooks and other instructional materials from these state adoptions. All of the textbooks 
currently in use meet these standards. They were selected to match the needs of Chico students by a Task Force comp
rised 
of teachers and administrators and approved by the Board of Education. The CUSD convenes curricular task forces to 
review textbooks in core subject areas on the Kindergarten through 8th grade state adopted list concurrent with the 
adoption cycle. The
se standards aligned textbooks are in the hands of all students within two years of adoption.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
McManus Elementary School was built in 1955 with two classrooms, an office and a multipurpose room. It has grown to 
31 classrooms, two special education rooms, a multipurpose room, a library, and an administration/
office wing. Two wings 
of permanent classrooms were constructed in 1968. Five portable classrooms, which included one computer lab, were 
constructed in 1984, and four more were added in 1996 to accommodate the Class Size Reduction Program. In 2004 the 
scho
ol was completely wired for networking, a school server was installed and in 2008 a wireless network was completed. 
In 2005, three additional classrooms were added and additional student bathrooms were installed for the increased 
student population. The pl
ayground was enlarged in 1984 with the addition of the portable classrooms and in 1996, an 
additional parking area and bus lanes were added. In 2005 a portion of the playground was reduced to accommodate our 
additional classrooms. In the summer of 2006 add
itional playground equipment was installed to accommodate the 
increased student population. The expansion of the cafeteria was accomplished by building a patio cover to house picnic 
tables, which are currently located 200 steps from the current multipurpos
e room.
 
 
District maintenance staff and site custodial staff ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and 
working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The principal works closely with the custodial staff to ensure that all 
school facilities are kept clean and free of safety hazards.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Progr
am, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school 
building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning
, electrical systems, interior or 
exterior painting, and floor systems.  McManus has installed new carpet and painted eight of the classrooms within the 
last five years.  This year, McManus participated in the Williams Act.  A facilities inspection is part
 
of the Williams Act and 
McManus passed this with no problem.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Chico Unified School Disrict has an updated emergency plan for fire drills, earthquakes, hazardous spills, and other 
emergency procedures, including active shooter.   Due to our proximity to major traffic patterns, there is an e
mphasis on 
bicycle, pedestrian, and traffic safety on our site.
 
 
Staff, students and parents strive to make our campus a safe, friendly place for all. We continually communicate student 
safety concerns to our school community through parent meetings, paren
t newsletters, parent education events, and 
personal contacts.  Supervision of students is provided before and after school. Before school all students report to areas 
designated for primary and intermediate students. Supervisors, custodians, office person
nel and teachers have access to 
phone or two
-
way radio communication at all times. Visitors are required to check in at the main office before they visit 
classrooms or other areas of the school. Emergency Action Plans are in place and staff and students pe
rform regular 
emergency/evacuation drills. The school safety plan is updated annually in accordance with Senate Bill 187.  McManus 
also conducts more than the required four code red drills each year to practice various emergency situations. McManus 
continu
es to practice the use of the Catapult System in to our Code Red Emergency Procedures.
 
 
Our School Safety Plan was updated this year and shared with staff and the Site Council in September.
