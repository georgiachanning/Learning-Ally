By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission of Bon View School is to empower globally minded scholars to take action and make a difference with integrity 
and responsibility through inquiry.
 
 
At Bon View, we ask each student to make a commitment to our In
ternational Baccalaureate Learner Profile attributes by 
being active participants in their learning and acting responsibly as an individual within our global community. Doing so 

aff considers it a privilege to educate the 740 
students we serve in grades preschool through 6th grade. We know however, that we will get the best results when we 
have a total community effort that involves parents, volunteers and partners working along w
ith the school to support, 
encourage and inspire our students. Because of our exceptional programs and the achievements of our students and staff, 

 
program 
provides all students with a transdisciplinary approach to ideas and concepts. We have several unique instructional 
programs to prepare our students to compete with students across the globe. Our special programs (music, art, specialized 
physical 
education, and language programs) allow students to develop their talents. Along with our International 
Baccalaureate focus, we have fully aligned the Common Core State Standards within our program. This adoption leads to 
a more rigorous approach to learni
ng. Success and achievement are nurtured in our classrooms where teachers are 
committed to helping each student become global citizens in this world.
 
 
Our school is also committed to global awareness and cultural understanding. We are extremely proud of th
e efforts made 
to achieve International Baccalaureate World School authorization. Bon View is a unique setting in which students build 
fundamental skills, grow their curiosity, begin to understand themselves as learners and develop a sense of who they are 
as 21st
-
century citizens. The Bon View staff have made a commitment to the following initiatives: 1. A continued focus on 
promoting Professional Learning Communities among our staff members. We believe one of the most effective ways to 
address student achi
evement is for all instructional staff members to be consistent in instruction and committed to 
student success. 2. Responsiveness to Instruction. Our goal is to monitor all students for academic success along the way 
and be more proactive to address our s
tudents' learning needs. 3. Positive Behavior Intervention and Support. This 
initiative is to further support our students in promoting character education and responsible citizenship. Although we 
require students to work hard, many opportunities exists fo
r participation in a multitude of extracurricular activities, 
including team sports, cultural interests, intellectual pursuits, GATE, etc. A student at our school may look forward to many
 
highly rewarding educational and personal experiences. New academic 
vistas will be explored, new friendships will be 
made, new perspectives on life will be developed, and the opportunity to mature at Bon View Elementary.
 
 
In addition to the IB framework, we have also embedded the Advancement Via Individual Determination (A
VID) framework 
to enhance our College Readiness skills in Preschool through 6th grade.  Students in all grade levels benefit from being 
Organized, utilizing a calendar or agenda regularly, developing notetaking skills, and inquiring about their learning. W
e 
strive to develop lessons that are rich in WICOR, which stands for Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and 
Reading.  AVID has supported our students in taking ownership in their learning.

Bon View is also a PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventio
n and Supports) School who values a positive approach to student 
discipline.  We have high expectations of our students and teach students how to behave appropriately through multiple 
strategies.  We recently were recognized by the PBIS Coalition as a PBIS
 
Silver school in 2019. Our behavior expectations 
align with our IB Learner Profile.  We support all students in being Thinkers, Open
-
Minded, Principled, Balanced, Reflective, 
Inquirers, Caring, Communicators, Courageous, and Knowledgeable.  Ultimately, ou
r goal at Bon View IB World School to 
empower globally minded students who take meaningful action to enhance their school, community, and world.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Bon View School was built originally in 1995. The school has a total of 33 classrooms, a library, and a multi
-
purpose room. 
The school is designed in pods to facilitate active learning in a 
stimulating environment. There are 11 portable classrooms 
that have been installed at various times. Three were installed with the original construction in 1995, five were added in 
1997, and one was added in 2001. The administration building houses offices
, a conference room, and staff work space. 
The school has a large field and enough equipment for student engagement. There are 21 restrooms, with 100% of the 
toilets in working condition. During the 17/18 school year the following projects where completed:
 
1. perimeter fence at 
the front of the school and on Philadelphia were heightened, additionally a wire mesh was added to the inside of the gate 
bars for heightened safety, and several portable classrooms received new carpet.  A new portable classroom was 
installed 
in the summer of 2018 due to increased student enrollment.  The front office was also provided new carpet in the summer 
of 2018. The school facility offers a good learning environment with fully functioning lighting, heating and cooling systems,
 
and noise negation. Internet access is available in the office and all classrooms. Each classroom has at least 1 computer 
and a printer. The district Information Services Department maintains a content filter for all Internet traffic, including E
-
mail, in 

campus. The perimeter gates remain closed throughout the day, which maintains limited access to the school when in 
session. Noon aides and cr
edentialed teachers provide supervision before, during and/or after school. All students enter 
the school through the front gates each morning. At all other times, parents and visitors enter the school through the 
office. District employees and substitutes
 
all wear district
-
issued identification badges. The front gates are closed when 
school begins and are not opened until dismissal. Students who are checked out early are done so by the front office. All 
staff members are diligent about being aware of adult
s on campus at all times. Visitors without visitor badges are escorted 
to the front office for check
-
in. Additionally, at the end beginning of the 18/19 school year a raptor system for volunteers 
was installed for heightened security in the front office.
 
 
To promote safety, Ontario Elementary School is a closed campus; gates are closed during the school day and visitors must 
enter through the main office to sign in at front desk prior to entering school premises. Visitors must present their 
California ID ba
dges and staff must present their district badge through our RAPTOR system. Signage has been placed at 
all gates directing visitors to check in at the office. All staff members have been provided with district ID badges. Ontario
 
Elementary School offers st
udent supervision before school, during school and after school. Supervision in the mornings 
is done by administrative team, support team, and Proctors beginning at 7:30 AM. Recess duty supervision and lunch 
supervision is offered by certificated staff, ad
ministrators and proctors. After school supervision is offered by 
administration team, support staff as well as teachers.
 
 
Bon View School is maintained in a manner that assures it is in good repair, functional and safe. The principal works with 
the custod
ial staff to make certain a daily cleaning schedule is maintained so classrooms, restrooms and the school 
grounds remain clean, safe and orderly, and that the floors, walls, and plumbing system are all in good repair. Site and 
district maintenance and grou
nds staffs make sure that the work necessary to keep the school in good working order and 
aesthetically pleasing are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is in use to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest p
riority. To assist in this effort, the district Operations Department annually 
conducts an in
-
depth evaluation of each school to determine the condition of the facilities and identify situations that 
need maintenance, repair or an upgrade. The district use
s a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California 
Office of Public School Construction to assist with the data gathering during the inspections. All findings are shared with 
the principal and  work orders for needed repairs are created at
 
that time. The results of this survey are available at the 
school office or the district office and are outlined below . During the most recent Facility Conditions Evaluation conducted
 

ldings, rooms, and grounds were found to be in 

deficiencies found and two good repair deficiencies. The found good repair deficiencies were r
emedied at the time of the 
inspection as listed in the report, and as follows:  Under Section 8. Restrooms: The POD E girls restroom: Soap/sanitizer 
dispensers damaged, broken or missing (work order #191155).  Further, under Section 15. Windows/Doors/Gates
/Fences: 
Playground: Fencing has holes or is not secured properly (work order # 191238).

Note: Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this 
category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the nu
mber that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using onl
y students who received 
scores.

Parents are welcomed as 
involved partners at Bon View School. Bon View parents and staff have developed a Parent 
Teacher Organization (PTO) to further provide opportunities for parents at the school. The PTO meets regularly to discuss 
opportunities to benefit the school. In addit
ion, parents are active in our School Site Council, English Language Learner 
Advisory Council, and as volunteers. Parents attend district functions such as the Parent Leadership conference, monthly 
SELPAC and DELPAC meetings and parent education classes. B
on View Elementary works closely with families to encourage 
their involvement in our school activities. Attendance at Back

and student performances continue to increase.  This year, we launched a clas
s parent program where classes can be 
adopted by one parent who can communicate regularly with the classroom community.
 
 
Parent education opportunities are offered through parenting classes and the Latino Family Literacy project throughout 
the year. Monthl
y Coffee with the Principal meetings are held allowing parents a forum for questions and suggestions. 
Frequent guest speakers are featured at these meetings providing valuable topics including Internet safety, the state 
adopted materials to review , parent
ing resources, technology support for parent, language arts and math per parents 
request.
 
 
Regular communication is provided in both English and Spanish via Class dojo, Blackboard Connect, our Marquee located 
in the front of the school, our monthly newslet
ter, and school website.  The school sends home important flyers and 
information each Tuesday in students' blue folder.

which addresses disaster procedures and routines, an action plan that ensures a safe physical 
environment and safe school climate, as well as our school safety compliance that ensures required child abuse reporting 
procedures, suspension and expulsion pol
icies, due process, notification to teachers about dangerous pupils, sexual 
harassment policy, school
-
wide dress code, procedure for safe ingress and egress from school, procedures to ensure a 
safe and orderly environment and rules and procedures on school
 
discipline. Monthly disaster drills are scheduled and 
practiced school

The Ontario
-
Montclair School District offers research
-
based, on
-
going professional development for certificated, classified 

-
term goals. Professional development is designed to help 
employees enhance
 
their know ledge and develop needed skills to provide quality services in order to maximize student 
learning and achievement. Professional development courses and programs are developed and coordinated by the district 
Learning and T eaching Division and a
re held at a variety of district locations as w ell as on
-
site. The focus of all professional 
development is based on the instructional and management priorities outlined in the goals and objectives of the school 
plan for student achievement. In addition, 
paraprofessionals such as instructional aides are offered training through the 
District Education Center and Pupil Personnel Services department. Clerical and Custodial staff training also occurs through 
the Maintenance and Operations Department and by Dis
trict Education Center personnel. The district also provides 
courses for teachers working towards their teaching credentials, support for veteran teachers through the Peer Assistance 
and Review program (PAR), technology training and classroom support, comp
liance related workshops and a variety of 
job
-
specific and mandated trainings for classified employees. OMSD has several sustained initiatives including writing 
development, language development, professional learning communities, and SMART goal planning. 
All teachers are in 
the process of attending training in the implementation of new Common Core State Standards. Professional development 
is offered primarily after
-
school, and during the school day on release days. This school year, classroom teachers have
 
had 
an average of 8 days of professional development including curriculum planning, Leadership planning, Data/analysis 
planning, and professional development workshops including Kagan Cooperative Learning, NGSS, Eureka Math, AVID, and 
Literacy.
 
 
Staff dev
elopment at Bon View is based on evaluations and observations from International Baccalaureate program 
consultants, district initiatives, and student and staff needs at the site. Student performance data, along with teacher and 
principal observations, help
 
determine professional development needs. The focus of our staff development sessions have 
been in the areas of writing using Write from the Beginning, Common Core Math & ELA, inquiry
-
based learning 
approaches, and implementation of IB units of study. Add
itional professional development this year included AVID and 
Kagan cooperative learning. Ongoing focus areas include International Baccalaureate (IB) Category I and II training, Write 
from the Beginning training, inquiry learning, common core standards, an
d Response to Intervention and Instruction. 
Teachers meet regularly for collaboration, analyzing student data, and planning instruction based on student 
performance.  This year, we launched the MTSS (Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support) initiative where a lead
ership team is 
actively working on strengthening our systems for Academics, Behavior, and Social
-
Emotional student support.
