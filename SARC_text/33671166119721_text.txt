By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

comprehensive scheduled preventative and deferred maintenance program to offset costly repairs and 
minimize 
disruptions to the instructional program.  The district maintenance staff ensures that the maintenance necessary to keep 
the school in good repair is completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure services and emergency 
repai
rs are given high priority. A complete and thorough facility inspection is done annually to identify future areas to 
address and prioritize facility needs.
 
 
In accordance with Ed. Code Section 17070.75 (e), the district uses a facility inspection system to
 
ensure each of its schools 
are maintained and in good repair. A work order process is used to coordinate service and to address emergency repairs 
immediately. A full
-
time custodian is on campus throughout every school day. A night custodial crew cleans cl
assrooms 
and office areas daily.  The custodial staff has developed a cleaning schedule to ensure a neat and orderly campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), 
including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy of the BMMS Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and st
aff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergencies, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to 
improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore enhance campus safety.
 
 
BMMS staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, which include a 

e campus. Any campus visitor is required to check
-
in 
using our Raptor system. BMMS Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly 
emergency drills and provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators
 
immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All BMMS staff take a s
trong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and 
investigate complaint matters thoroughly.
 
 
Our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system teaches and reinforces appropriate student behaviors. 
We foster social
-
emotional learning (
SEL) skills development in the form of weekly lessons delivered school
-
wide to all 
students, supported by curriculum from SecondStep.org.  The curriculum establishes high expectations for achievement 
by all students in every subject area, and students are 
supported by counseling services that include crisis counseling, peer 
counseling, and intervention programs.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared
 
to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days of professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been 
on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provi
ded before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferences, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and admini
strators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
