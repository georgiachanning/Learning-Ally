By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
Buena Vista Board of Trustees and the district administrators, our united team of teachers, support 
staff, students,
 
and families welcomes you to a place of learning where traditional activities and events augment vital 

The School Accountability Report C
ard was established by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in 
November 1988.  The Report Card, to be issued annually by local school boards for each elementary and secondary school 
in the state, provides for parents and other interest
ed people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its 
successes, and the areas in which improvements are needed.
 
 
Van Horn Elementary School receives Title I funds from the federal government. The Title I funds are used to assist low 
achi
eving students in core subjects.  A standards
-
based curriculum and sound assessment strategies provide the 
foundation for continuous improvement of student performance and school programs.  Students will leave Van Horn 
Elementary School with a positive att
itude toward learning, a strong foundation in basic skills, and the ability to meet 
future academic challenges.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Van Horn Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenance program is 
administered by the 
District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that 
provides for good learning. On going repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed California Building and Safety 

f Safety and Risk Management verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The 
exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and safety. A team of
 
custodians ensures classrooms and campus groun
ds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and 
secured at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan, 
the safety committee has addressed concerns for the safe comin
g and going of our students. Staff receive inservice in 
emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying tags are issued to substitute teachers, volunteers, and other visitors as they 
register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of the school playground are l
ocked during school hours and staff 
members are trained to activate lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local 
law enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns arise. Designated staff members
 
carefully 
supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly 
for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire 
an
d/or disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and 
available for public review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins officially at 7:20 a.m. when the school 
opens and supervisi
on ends at 2:45 p.m.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Van Horn Elementary School believes students who develop a sense of personal responsibility will mature both 
academically and emotionally.  Van Horn Elementary School has a positive learning environment rooted in the PBIS 
philosophy.  The goal of Van Horn'
s positive behavior plan is model appropriate behavior and actions while acknowledging 
students who demonstrate the desired behaviors.  A tiered behavior model is implemented which encourages strong 
communication systems between school, teacher, and parent
.
 
 
Attendance at school is crucial in the academic and emotional growth for Van Horn Elementary students.  The school 
contacts families of students with excessive tardies, truancies or unexcused absences via letter for mandatory parent 
conferences to discu


must be absent from school due to ill
ness for an extended period of time.
 
 
In cooperation with the Bakersfield Police Department, Van Horn established a Valet Program to provide a safe area for 
drop off.  BPD has also provided feedback on our secure campus procedures through communication wit
h school resource 
officers.  On November 2, 2018, our Safe School Plan was reviewed, discussed, updated, and approved by our School Site 
Council with input from staff and community partners.

ary Education Act, (ESEA) provides financial assistance to local 
educational agencies (LEAs) and schools with high numbers or high percentages of children from low
-
income families to 
help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards. 
Title I is designed to help students served by the 
program to achieve proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards. Title I schools with percentages of 
students from low
-
income families of at least 40 percent may use Title I funds, along
 
with other Federal, State, and local 
funds, to operate a "school wide program" to upgrade the instructional program for the whole school. Based on an analysis 
of student achievement data done be the school site, Title I resources may be used for professio
nal development, 
supplemental instruction and intervention, parental involvement, personalization and support for students with at
-
risk 
behaviors. Targeted assistance schools design, in consultation with parents, staff, and district staff, an instructional
 
program to meet the needs of specifically identified students who are failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet the State'
s 
challenging academic achievement standards . Both school wide and targeted assistance programs must use instructional 
strategies
 
based on scientifically based research and implement parental involvement activities.
