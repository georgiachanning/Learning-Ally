Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

Maintaining a safe and orderly environment is essential to learning. The Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) is 
developed by Park Dale Lane Elementary in consultation with local law enforcement/Emergency Preparedness staff, 
School Site Council (SSC) an
d Administrative Services in order to comply with Senate Bill 187. It was most recently updated 
and reviewed in September 2019 and accepted by the Board of Trustees in November 2019.
 
 
The CSSP includes elements such as emergency plans and procedures, inclu
ding the Run, Hide, Fight Model, the School 
Protection Evacuation Plan for Wildfire, school rules and school dress codes. Fire drills are conducted monthly, earthquake 
drills are held four times a year, and two lockdown exercise drills are practiced each y
ear. All schools in the district are 
closed campuses, and visitors must immediately register in the school office before entering the campus. School access is
