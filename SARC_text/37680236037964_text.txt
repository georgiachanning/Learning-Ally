O
ur mission at Myrtle S. Finney School is to nurture and teach students so that they will become 
confident, critical thinkers who posses a deep sense of responsibility to self and to the community.  
We create a safe learning environment, where our students 
engage in rigorous academic work and

Description
 
Finney School is one of 49 schools in the Chula Vista Elementary School District, including charters. 
It has a diverse ethnic makeup and many students come from homes in which English is
 
not the 
primary language. Many students are third and fourth generation residents in the area and our 
school is at the core of neighborhood layout. Our demographic breakdown is as follows: Hispanic 
or Latino 81%, Filipino 8%, African American, not Hispani
c 2%, White, not Hispanic 5%, and Two or 
more races 3%.
 
 
Our TK
-
6th grade enrollment is 384 students. 34% of our students are classified as English Learners 
and 80% of our students are classified at Socioeconomically Disadvantaged. 21% of our population 
is
 
classified as Students with Disabilities and 5% are identified as GATE.
 
 
A variety of programs are offered to meet the needs of our students. These include computer 
programs that build reading, language and math skills.  An SDC preschool program is on sit
e along 
with three full
-
day Moderate/Severe special education classes for students TK
-
6, a Resource 
Specialist Program, and Speech & Language Therapy preschool through grade 6. To support our 
English Leaners, teachers incorporate both integrated and design
ated English Language 
Development (ELD) instruction.
 
 
As students focus on learning and achieve grade level targets, student recognition assemblies are 
planned to recognize citizenship and academic achievement. During our assemblies, parents, 
teachers, sta
ff, students, and parents are celebrated thus creating a positive climate focused on 
learning and success.
 
 
The CVESD state preschool program offers classes for three
-
and four
-
year
-
olds at Finney. These 
daily, three
-
hour sessions are offered in English and
 
Spanish. They provide students with a 
developmentally appropriate experience before entering kindergarten.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
co
ntains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which desc
ribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information abo
ut SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); a

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of 
students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they receiv
ed a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.
