By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In 1963 Martinez Unified School District purchased
 
11.6 acres to build a school. Original construction began in 1965 and a 
six classroom school was built. Additional modular classrooms were added in subsequent years. In 1991 the entire site 
was demolished to make room for the present K
-
5 elementary school
. The project was completed in 1993 and the school 
opened for students.The school has 21 classrooms, one Learning Center, one music room, and one computer lab. Both 
sets of student restrooms are wheelchair accessible. Our Multi
-
Use room is used as our lunc
h room,and for assemblies 
and PE activities. A 31 station computer lab is used by students to supplement their learning with technology.

Morello Park's physical environment reflects the standards of both our school and our community. Our school is inspect
ed 
regularly by school district personnel. In addition, necessary repairs and maintenance ensure a safe facility.  The school 
community takes pride in our school environment by maintaining a clean and well
-
groomed campus. The buildings and 
grounds are very
 
attractive and well
-
kept. Parents help maintain the facility on designated clean
-
up days. The playground 
is clean and neat with a nearby city field available for school use. Students help in keeping the campus clean by assisting 
in trash pick ups. Maintai
ning a clean and safe environment is a high priority at Morello Park.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

At Morello Park, we are fortunate to have strong community support through the PTA and active parent involvement. PTA 
fundraisers such as the Jog
-
A
-
Thon and the annual Eagles for Excellence Dinner Dance Auction provid
e additional funds 
for school programs, and community events. "Coffee with the Principal" is held monthly and provides an open forum for 
dialogue and discussion. The staff at Morello Park understands that developing and maintaining productive meaningful 
pa
rtnerships with families and communities ensures the highest quality education for all students. Parents are encouraged 
to volunteer at school in  classrooms and on field trips. The PTA, which meets the second Tuesday of every month, offers 
a wide array of
 
ways to participate in school projects: the Harvest Festival, Harvest of the Month, FAME, STEAM and the 
Eagle Reading Program are just a few of the many PTA sponsored activities which require parent help. Parents are invited 
to serve on the School Site Co
uncil, the district level Curriculum Advisory Committee, the district level Technology Advisory 
Committee, and the English Learner Advisory Committee. All levels of involvement strengthen the school
-
family bond and 
encourage student participation in positi
ve school activities.
 
 
Teachers send home newsletters and/or post information on the MPE Website, highlighting curriculum being taught and 
notifying parents of upcoming events at the school. The principal sends a Monthly Newsletter highlighting events and 
updating the community on activities. Other forms of communication from the principal or staff include REMIND, DOJO, 
Twitter and Parent Link emails or phone messages. Our website contains our current school year activities calendar and 
other pertinent info
rmation. Parents are encouraged to attend Back to School Night, annual parent conferences in October 
and Open House in the spring.
 
 
Parent Involvement is a large contributor to the success of the students at Morello Park Elementary. The strong bond 
between
 
parents and the school contribute to the close working partnership and student success that is visible on our 
campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Morello embraces safety and 
adheres to the Comprehensive Safe School Plan, by making safe practices a priority. Monthly 

System. Fire and earthquake drills occur regu
larly throughout the year and are recorded for documentation.  "Lock Down 
and Lock Out" drills occur frequently to prepare for emergencies. We believe that practicing on a regular basis along with 
classroom discussions will create safe habits and student a
wareness in an actual emergency. All classrooms are equipped 
with disaster preparedness materials, which are inventoried and replenished annually. The PTA provides emergency food 
and water each year for all classrooms. Classrooms and the office are connect
ed by telephone, walkie talkies and email. 
The office staff, principal, noon supervisors, and the custodians facilitate communication throughout the campus when 
necessary. All staff has been trained on emergency and reunification procedures.
 
 
Safety has al
so been discussed with our parent community. There is a designated area for drop off and pick up so students 
wait in a supervised area and are called to a numbered cone as their parents arrive. Visitors are required to sign in the 
office and wear a badge t
hroughout their visit. Students are supervised before and after school by certificated adults. 
Parents are to drop off their children and need to sign in the office if they are going to remain on campus. Animals are 
prohibited on school property.  Updated 
communication is shared with parents via REMIND, Twitter, phone messages and 
emails.

Martinez Unified professional development focus for the past eight years has been to transform classroom practice to 
meet the demands of college and career readiness. Content emphasis has 
been on the implementation of the Common 
Core State Standards (CCSS), the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and the use of technology to transform and 
enhance instruction. Though each individual school site varies in its particular needs around the
se areas, as a district the 
vision for Professional Development is consistent among all schools. As the focus has shifted from the transition to the 
CCSS to the implementation of the instructional rigor needed to fully address the standards, Professional L
earning has had 
to shift as well. In the past few years, MUSD has emphasized the changes required of educators around key focus areas: 
mindset, intentionality, instruction, and access.
 
 
Professional Development is formally provided to all teachers two 
full
-
days a year; one day in August and one in January. 
In addition to the full
-
day training provided, three half
-
day PD release times are provided to our teaching staff. This year 
these release times have been focused on Writing Calibration across all ele
mentary sites. We have also provided time to 
train teachers in our new IXL online skill
-
building platform. This supplemental program provides Tier I differentiated 
support and a customized learning plan for all K
-
5 students. Additional opportunities for in
dividual and grade
-
level specific 
professional development in other content areas, i.e. EL learners, math, Universal Design for Learning, etc. are also 
provided based on teacher needs and site requests.
 
 
Beginning in 2017
-
18, and continuing through and int
o 2019
-
20, professional development at the elementary level has 
been focused on the implementation and extension (with the recent addition of a K
-
2 Phonics Program) of Readers and 
Writer's Workshop.  To support implementation and student learning, MUSD has
 
brought in consultants who are expertly 

in varying ways over the past three years. Each year professional development has been designed
 
to support teacher and 
student growth, as well as rigor within this program. Training includes "demo days" where the coaches plan and model 
instruction with teachers and then, in turn, teachers practice in front of the coaches.  The coaches have also spen
t time 
with principals discussing the elements of the workshop model, what to look for when conducting classroom observations, 
and how to give feedback to teachers within the workshop.  This has built the capacity of our teachers and principals to 
sustain 
the implementation of high
-
quality instruction within our Balanced Literacy block.  In addition, the coaches work 
with Reading and Writing Support Teachers from each site to provide additional training.  The Support Teachers (primary 
and upper elementary t
eachers from each site, up to four teachers per site) meet five times a year with the coaches, as 
well as provide training and support for colleagues at their respective school sites via staff meetings, grade
-
level training, 
and 1:1 support.
 
 
At Morello, s
taff has been trained on the following in addition to the district training provided: Behavior Support, Mindset, 
Equity, Cultural Responsiveness, Youth Suicide Prevention & Awareness, Mandated Reporter, Bloodborne Pathogen, 
Asbestos Awareness and Safety Pr
otocols.
