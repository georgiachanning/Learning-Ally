About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about
 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to
 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, se
e the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

to fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements. Components of this plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notificati
on of dangerous pupil 
procedures, disaster 
response procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. 
The 
school's most recent school safety plan was reviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff in August 2019.  Detailed maps
 
a
nd a trained search and 
rescue team comprised of certificated and classified staff meet monthly to monitor and make needed changes to the safety plan
.  All staff members have 
a copy of the safety plan and substitute teachers are provided the plan in a subs
titute teacher folder when they arrive on campus.  The improved safety 
plan currently in place allows for all students to evacuate to one side of campus with a protocol for monitoring students and
 
signing them out in the 
event of a disaster.
 
 
The entire sc
hool body participates in monthly drills to include: Fire Drills, Earthquake Drills, Lockdown Drills, Active threat Drills, a
nd Evacuation practice.  
At the conclusion of each drill, the staff participates in surveys to identify practices that need refinem
ent, supply needs, and general feedback on the 
process.  Specialists who come to campus throughout the week receive a copy of the safety plan and support staff, including p
layground supervisors, are 
trained in procedure and response. All parent volunteers 
receive training prior to coming on to campus so that they recognize all of the signals to alert 
adults on the campus of potential emergencies.
