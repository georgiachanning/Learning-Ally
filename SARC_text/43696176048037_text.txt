School Description
 
August Boeger Middle School
 
 
Vision: All Students Achieve
 
 
The mission of August Boeger Middle School is to provide our students with a safe learning 
environment that promotes academic success through social emotional learning, critical thinking, 
and problem solving. We strive to build strong relationships and cre
ate responsible, productive 
students in a global society.
 
 
August Boeger fosters a safe, respectful, and responsible environment that promotes learning. 
August Boeger Middle School consists of grades 6, 7, and 8 with a student body of 538 students. 
The sch
ool is located near the foothills in east San Jose, California. It is the only traditional middle 
school in the Mount Pleasant Elementary School District. The staff is comprised of two 
administrators, a part
-
time psychologist, a part
-
time speech therapist,
 
a part
-
time counselor, a 
part
-
time family case manager, 2 secretaries, 1 health clerk, 29 certificated staff and a support staff 
of 7. In addition, the school has a library technician, and two campus supervisors.
 
 
August Boeger has an active Mount Pleasan
t After School program (MPAS) that serves about 150 
students from 2:35 until 6:00 PM. Our MPAS program provides homework center, enrichment 
activities, and sports.
 
 
The teachers' facilitate student learning with the goal that each student master the Califo
rnia 
Common Core State Standards. We value the 4 C's of 21st Century Learning (collaboration, 
creativity, critical thinking and communication) and use AVID elective and strategies to provide 
rigor and structure to our students' daily learning.
 
 
Our staff i
s a community of learners who work together to improve teaching practices. We value 
and encourage the family partnership that is necessary for fostering high student achievement. The 
August Boeger staff works, alongside our parents, to achieve student succ
ess.
 
 
Curriculum and Instruction
 
 
Instructional Day
 
We have six periods with homeroom at the beginning of each day. Our 6th grade students are in 
Core classrooms (Science/Math & Language Arts/Social Studies) and are grouped for English 
Language 
Development (ELD) instruction for forty
-

language proficiency levels. Our 7th and 8th grade students rotate classes for Language Arts, Social 
Studies, Mathematics, Elective (AVID, Leadership, World Language, STEM
, Band, Movement, and 
Art), ELD, Physical Education, and Science. Our students use technology through our six 
Chromebook carts, and five iPad carts.

Teaching and Learning
 
Through the implementation of the district
-
adopted curriculum and project
-
based learning, students tackle
 
a challenging academic 
curriculum in ways that are engaging, meaningful, based on real
-
life contexts, and adaptable to a variety of learning styles. The curriculum 
is tied to the Common Core State Standards. The school informs parents of their student's p
rogress; report cards are provided to parents 
three times a year, and grade checks are given to parents twice a month. Parents also receive their student's Standardized te
st results in 
the summer with a follow
-
up interpretation of results at the fall paren
t
-
teacher conference. Teachers use curriculum assessment and 
formative assessment data during the school year to assess teaching and learning practices and provide feedback to students a
nd parents.
 
 

 
The school works in collaborat
ion with multiple stakeholders to address the academic, emotional and physical needs of our students. 
Academically the goal is to improve teaching and learning practices for all students by providing professional development an
d 
opportunities for teachers 
to collaborate. When students are not successful, the school will take the following actionable steps to address 
their needs. The school holds a Student Success Team (SST) meetings with parents, student, homeroom teacher, counselor, stude
nt 
advisor, princi
pal, and psychologist. We determine what the student needs with input from all stakeholders and create a plan to help the 
student succeed. We continue to monitor students throughout the school year and adjust the plan as needed. Students who are 
significan
tly behind in reading, participate in LLI, a reading intervention program that provides adaptive individualized instruction. 
Besides 
providing targeted supports identified during the SST meetings, and providing support during the school day through ELD, AV
ID, 
homeroom, and inclusion classrooms, the school also offers additional academic support to identified students by providing ex
tended 
day and extended year opportunities. The school also has a family case manager to support the students and families to a
ccess school 
and community resources. The district has several partnerships with community agencies such as Foothill Community Health Cent
er, Diva 
Diveristy Counseling, Santa Clara Mental Health, Alum Rock Counseling, and other agencies.
 
 
Response to Inter
vention
 
We identify students at risk through our RtI process and hold Student Success Team (SST) meetings with parents, student, home
room 
teacher, counselor, student advisor, principal and psychologist. We determine what the student needs with input from a
ll stake
-
holders 
and create a plan to help the student succeed. We continue to monitor students throughout the school year and adjust the plan
 
as needed. 
Students who are significantly behind in reading, participate in LLI, a reading intervention program t
hat provides adaptive individualized 
instruction.
 
 
School Discipline
 
August Boeger staff has been trained in the PeaceBuilder Program and BEST Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS)
 
programs. 
These programs promote personal and community safet
y, respect, and responsibility. Students receive "Boeger Bucks" from August 
Boeger staff as they promote how to Be Safe, Be Respectful, and Be Responsible. We have high expectations and believe that al
l children 
can learn. Our discipline is fair, consisten
t, and research based. We promote a sense of school pride in all students by recognizing student 
achievement and progress. We focus on making our school a positive and safe learning environment in order to set the foundati
on for 
student achievement.  We ar
e also beginning to incorporate the MTSS process to our school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

August Boeger staff has been trained in the PeaceBuilder Program and BEST Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS)
. These programs promote 
personal and community respect, responsibility and safety. The staff continues to receive trai
nings in positive behavior strategies and interventions 
throughout the year. The BEST Committee, composed of classified and certificated staff members, meets monthly to look at data
 
and make 
recommendations to improve school climate. August Boeger staff ha
s received professional development in Social Emotional Learning. The school is 
working to incorporate more restorative justice practices, where students are more responsible for their behaviors and all st
udents take ownership in 
the school community. A sc
hool wide reward system (Boeger Bucks) and classroom reward systems are in place to increase student motivation and 
positive behaviors. The school has seen a significant reduction in office referrals, and out of school suspensions since thes
e practices hav
e been 
incorporated.
 
 
Data collected through the California Heathy Kids Survey, School Climate Survey and parent surveys are used to help improve s
chool climate and address 
any identified issues. Student assemblies have been held to address anti
-
bullying e
fforts, drug prevention and gang
-
prevention, and explicitly teaching 
expected behaviors in the school setting.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
The Mt. Pleasant Sc
hool District has consistently focused its staff development efforts to address the needs of the students and teachers to inc
rease 
student achievement. In the past three years, the professional development for teachers has been to support teachers with the
 
implementation of the 
newly adopted English Language Arts and Mathematics curriculum. Below are examples of the professional development that the d
istrict and schools 
have provided in the past three years:
 
 
2017
-
18 to 2019
-
2020:
 
 
*Teacher Induction: In partnership with Silicon Valley New Teacher Center, the district assists new teachers to clear their t
eaching credentials. Teachers 
receive staff development and mentor support from a credential teacher on special assignment to maste
r the standards for the teaching profession and 
complete all induction requirements.
 
 
*Our AVID teachers provide ongoing professional development on AVID strategies throughout the year.
 
 
All Grades reviewed essential components of Project Based 
Learning (PBL). Teachers received guided support to work collaboratively with grade level 
peers and departments to develop a PBL unit that is culturally relevant to the students/communities that we serve. The PBL in
corporated the Global 
Citizenship standar
ds to help students understand their role as global citizens who respect and value diversity, understanding social justice, w
ork with 
others to make the world around them more equitable, and help students take responsibility for their actions.
