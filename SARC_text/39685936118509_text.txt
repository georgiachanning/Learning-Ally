By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About Our School
 
Joseph Widmer Elementary is focused on providing rigorous, standards
-
aligned instruction to ensure all students work 
towards mastery of the standards.  The use of data to drive inst

of our lowest readers in first and second grades.  Tutorial support for additional struggling readers in grades first through
 
third are provided in tutorial.  English language learners are offered bilingual aid s

also offered a Rosetta Stone Tutorial.
 
 
Joseph Widmer also continues to focus on the development of a positive, safe school environment in which we teach 
desired behaviors, acknowledge and celebrate success while settin
g firm, clear expectations and applying appropriate 

this program while developing tier 2 supports.  We are implementing a data colle
ction program called five
-
star students 
to amass data on the positive behaviors of our students. We have also begun to proactively address student behavior 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for 
Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The success of a school is strongly influenced by the support of parents and the school community as a whole. Joseph 
Widmer School enjoys great parent involvement through our PTC program and in class volunteers.
  
The School Advisory 
Council and English Language Advisory Council to support students and school programs also provide pathways for parent 
involvement.  Multiple community events provide parents an opportunity to connect with school with their children 
t
hrough a variety of activities.  During the school year, we host Back to School Night in the fall, STEAM night in the spring,
 
Harvest festival, Literacy night, Math night, Acorn League Sports, band and choir concerts,  a talent show, primary holiday 
concer
ts and PRIDE ceremonies to honor student accomplishment in the areas of academics, attendance and behavior. 
Administration also maintains an open
-
door policy for parents and students. To find out how you can get more involved
