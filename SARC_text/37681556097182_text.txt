Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Oak 
Grove students are housed in a state of the art facility which was built in 1994. The OGMS facility includes three 
science labs, a technology center, 1 to 1 chrome books in our classrooms, a music room, a multipurpose gym, a library, a 
fully equipped weigh
t/work out room, and a covered lunch area. The community installed an artificial turf field and 
artificial track during the summer of 2016. A future sports complex at OGMS is being planned by a community group.
 
 
Last year Oak Grove again partnered with 
SDG&E in maximizing energy efficiency by changing lights to energy efficient 
bulbs, cleaning heating and air conditioning units, changing filters, and installing light sensors.
 
 
Trees have been removed in some areas to prevent damage to sewer lines.
 
 
Rooms
 
are cleaned daily with a deep cleaning done three times a year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School should be a place where our children find a safe and secure environment. Research studies show that students 
who feel their unique talents valued and feel a strong connection to those around them can overcome adversities and 
succeed in life, becomin
g well
-
balanced, well
-
educated adults. Our safety plan starts with the front office staff who are 
very careful to document emergency contacts, custody arrangements, and health concerns. Our Citizenship Rubric and 
Character development lessons teach Oak Gro
ve Eagles to fly through AIR (Attitude, Integrity, Responsibility). Our students 
who face challenges are afforded a safety net by our school psychologist. In addition, we provide a Check Your Mood 
Week (in conjunction with San Diego Youth Services) which f
ocuses on suicide prevention. Counseling is also provided to 
student that can benefit from the additional support.  Teacher professional development includes trauma informed care 
and Mindfulness for students. That learning has continued and now has expande
d to include Restorative Practices.  In 
addition, our students and staff have been trained on how to use the Sandy Hook Say Something Anonymous app. to 
report any suspicion of self harm or the potential of a violent act.  We have also begun the SAVE club a
nd a Making a 
Difference clubs for students to take a leadership role focused on creating a helping others.
 
 
School and District Safety Plans are updated annually and housed in each office. The staff is trained on how to respond to 
emergencies on our site 
and conduct on
-
going practice drills.
