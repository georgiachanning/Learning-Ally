By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Crowley Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers. Su
fficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed
 
by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of this 
survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be 
obtained by speaking with the school principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs
 
are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
In 2019, there were no major maintenance and repair projects at Crowley School.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after h
ours for daily 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff work cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Main
tenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, air
 
conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all class¬rooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.
 
 
Facilitie
s Improvement
 
During the summer of 2013, three large solar panels were installed at Crowley School.  These panels provide electrical 
power and excellent shade for our students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Crowley Elementary School continually strives 
to involve parents by sharing information to help parents support their child, asking for input and by providing 
opportunities for parent participation in scho
ol activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms and opportunities for parents to serve 
as 
chaperones on school field trips. Crowley Elementary School will continue with "Coffee with the Principal" 
(informational parent meetings with Principal).  Our meetings will focus on: Social Emotional Learning, Reading Strategies, 
Growth Mindset, and paren
tal support.  Parents will receive training on how to help their students with reading strategies 
and will also learn about social emotional learning and how they can help their students at home. Additionally, parental 
involvement opportunities include:  S
chool Site Council Meetings, English Learner Advisory Committee Meetings, Coffee 
with the Principal, Academic Awards Assemblies, Concerts, Dance Club, Kinder Workshops, Kinder Orientations, Parent 
Book Clubs, Mom's Club (meetings with our regularly volunte
ers). Parents may also serve on advisory committees and 
leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council 
(SSC).   Additional opportunities for parental involvement also exist at the dist
rict level.  Parents who would like more 
information on how to become involved may contact Principal Nikki Jimenez at (559) 730

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Crowley Elementary School. Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. 
Entrances to school grounds are secured or 
monitored during the school day.  Supervising staff wear neon vests for easy identification.  Students, parents and other 
staff are able to easily find a staff member that is assisting with supervision and ask for
 
assistance.  To ensure safety, all 
visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.

The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies.
 
The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated 
as needed, and fully com
pliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office.
 
 

preparedness drills are c
onducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.
 
 
The school's safety plan was updated, reviewed, and approved by the School Site Council on October 2019.

Our district provides professional development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas 
of need are being addressed.  Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroom level dependent on 
teach
er goals.   The district provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and 
support after professional development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our a


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unifi
ed offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
In
stitute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagemen
t and cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meeti
ngs with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom 
tours, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Me
ntors and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Inductio
n Clear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be
 
needed in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
