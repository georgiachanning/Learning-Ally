School Description
 
James Dougherty Elementary is located in the center of the tri
-
valley
 
corridor of the East Bay. The school is 
positioned in the middle of a residential community, and only a few blocks from the entertainment center of 
the City of Dublin. The community that we serve is highly educated, values excellent schools, and hold high
 
expectations for their children.
 
 
At the core of our mission is the belief that we are here to serve every student. James Dougherty Elementary 
realizes this by being committed to differentiating instruction to ensure that every student will achieve and 
wo
rk to their greatest potential. As a professional learning community, we use grade level and cross grade 
level collaboration and staff meetings to develop strategies to reach every student and make instruction not 
just rigorous but also engaging.  It is th
is work that earned James Dougherty the California Distinguished School 
status in the spring of 2012, National Blue Ribbon status in the fall of 2015, and California Gold Ribbon in the 
spring of 2016 . At Dougherty we are also strong advocates for the soci
al and emotional well
-
being of all 
students and celebrating the rich diversity of our community. Through our Dublin Integrity in Action character 
education program, we promote core character values. These values are highlighted throughout the school 
year t
hrough monthly awards given to students who exhibit strong traits of character development.
 
 
The essence and strength of Dougherty is in its community. We have an involved Parent Faculty Club (PFC) 
that raises money to support programs and provide teachers
 
with materials to enhance instruction.  Dougherty 
also works with the City of Dublin to promote student activities like Walk and Roll to School, St. Patrick's Day 

 
volunteers that 
help in our classrooms make Dougherty truly a community cornerstone.
 
 

purpose is providing education and enrichment for each and eve
ry student. It is the efforts of our dedicated 

Dougherty a true distinguished school.
 
 
School Vision
 
Dougherty Elementary School provides a safe,
 
positive learning environment that develops self
-
motivated, 
independent, and enthusiastic learners who strive toward academic excellence, social responsibility, and 
personal growth. The goal of the faculty, staff, and parents is to provide a program desig
ned to meet the 
academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of each of our students.
 
 
Mission Statements
 
At Dougherty Elementary, we believe an exemplary and equitable educational program is the collaborative 
result of students, staff, parents and the 
community working together to develop ethical citizens and life long 
learners.  We move forward with this focus by:

and the opportunity to thrive. Students are gu
ided through a well
-
planned comprehensive core 
curriculum.
 
2.
 
All students are routinely assessed formally and informally to check for understanding and 
proficiency on Common Core standards. Students are expected to model, synthesize, and apply 
information in
to concrete or collaborative project
-
based learning.
 
3.
 
All students in need of academic support are provided modifications as well as intervention services 
such as push
-
in programs, pull
-
out programs, on
-
line curriculum, on
-
line resources,  Response
 
to 
Intervention blocks and after school programs.
 
4.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Curren
cy, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by the state education officials. For more than six years,
 
panels of scholars have 
decided what California st
udents should learn and be able to do. Their decisions are known as the California Content Standards, and they apply to all 
public schools in the state. The textbooks we use and the test we give are based on these content standards, and we expect ou
r teach
ers to be firmly 
focused on them.
 
 
All students have their own set of textbooks to use in class or at home.
 
 
In the area of English Language Arts, Starfall was adopted for all Kindergarten students in 2016.  Benchmark Advanced was ado
pted in 2018.  The dis
trict 
adopted mathematics program is Scott Foresman's EnVision Math, which was adopted in 2015.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Dougherty Elementary School opened in fall 20
00. Our campus includes 35 classrooms, a beautiful gymnasium, and a centrally located library/media 
center that contains a collection of more than 8,500 books, four computer research stations, an expansive seating area, and a
 
separate storytelling room.  
A
dditionally, our campus houses three playgrounds and extensive fields, which provide students with the space and equipment to
 
play and develop 
athletic skills.
 
 
We have two full
-
time custodians who work a split day shift and also have a district night clea
ning crew who help to keep our facilities clean. Each 
classroom is cleaned every other day, with the restrooms cleaned daily.  District maintenance regularly maintains the school 
facility and landscaping.
 
 
A new outdoor shade structure was built outside of
 
the multipurpose room to accommodate outdoor lunches. A second shade structure was built on our 
primary yard for K
-
2 usage.
 
 
In the summer of 2009, the District installed skateboard deterrents on the steps and low walls around the campus.
 
 

standing library collection is continually growing. We update the collection each year after doing a collection analysis and 
aligning our 
needs with the state and school library standards.
 
 


technician works five hours a day, reading stories and circulating books to each class on a weekly basis. The library is open
 
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 2:00 
p.m.

Each week classroom teachers have the ability to take their students into our Science room. The Science lab is equipped with 
a a variety of science 
material and is designed for hands on labs. Additionally, our PFC funds a program entitled Art in Action.  A
rt in Action is a program that is driven by our 
parent volunteers.  This program takes place 6 times a year in our Art in Action room, which is stocked with art supplies.  S
tudents use multimedia to 
show evidence of learning. They use the internet for rese
arch and web
-
based programs and resources to enhance the curriculum. Teachers have access 
to 20 laptop computers for classroom use. All first through third grade classrooms have Chromebooks with a two to one ratio f
or student use. All 
classroom computers h
ave programs to support students in reading, comprehension skills, and math. Teachers use computers to correspond with 
colleagues and parents via email and to access the internet. Many use computers for record keeping. All DK, and first through
 
fifth grade
 
classrooms have 
Smartboards and document cameras. Our new kindergarten classrooms have touch televisions that allow for students and teachers
 
to use interactively.
 
 
The District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides
 
state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical syste
ms, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
In the summer of 2014 an addition of five portables were added to the campus to accommodate the increase of student populatio
n at Dougherty. All 
rooms were equipped with the district standard technolog
y.
 
 
It was board approved in November of 2015 to begin the construction of the Developmental Kindergarten/ Kindergarten complex. 
Construction began 
in the summer of 2016 and was completed in the summer of 2017. The new facility was opened to students in Au
gust of 2017.

At Ja
mes Dougherty Elementary School, certificated and classified staff, students, and parents collaborate for success. Parent vol
unteers have dedicated 
many hours to numerous activities that support the curriculum and student success.  At Dougherty, we have ma
ny ways for parents to participate in the 
life of our school and we are proud of the collaborative partnership that help keep our programs running smoothly.
 
 
Teachers encourage parents to volunteer in their classrooms. Such volunteering opportunities can b
e ongoing, as many parents volunteer in the 
classroom on a weekly basis.  Each classroom on the James Dougherty campus has a room parent.  Room parent duties include org
anizing parent 
volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and chaperonin
g on field trips.
 
 
Additionally, parents work in conjunction with school staff on our School Site Council.  This body works with the principal a
nd staff personnel to develop 
the school site plan, which is directly tied to the financial decisions that suppo
rt programs at the school site.
 
 
Parents of our English Learners are vital to our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) and to our outreach efforts on be
half of new families.  
Members of our English Language Community serves as participants at our ELA
C meetings, which are held at the school site and coordinated by our site 
ELD Specialist.  This forum is a perfect place for the parents of our Language Learners to provide input in the goals outline
d in the 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement.
 
 
Lastly, ou

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Dougherty is a closed campus that is enclosed with fencing. Visitors must enter the school through the main door and sign in 
at 
the office, where they 

s Law. The staff, including 
our Campus Supervisor, monitors the school grounds for 15 minutes before and aft
er school as well as at all recesses and at lunch time. At the start of 
each school year, the school administration holds grade level span assemblies in which the school expectations and playground
 
rules are discussed and 
communicated with the student body
.  Further, teachers regularly review with their classes the rules for safe and responsible behavior in school and on 
the playground.
 
 
We annually update and revise our school safety plan, which is based on the Safety Emergency Management System. The plan 
includes procedures for 
emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We share and monitor the plan with all staff during school w
ide staff meetings. We 
remind parents about safety procedures in monthly newsletters, as well as on the sch

site Safety committee.  Members of this group additionally attend district wide safety meetings with representatives from all
 
of the school sites within 
the district.  Students participate i
n monthly drills which include fire, earthquake, intruder on campus and shelter in place drills to practice safety 
responses.
