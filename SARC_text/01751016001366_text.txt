School Description
 
Donlon Elementary School is located in Pleasanton Unified School District and is one of nine 
elementary schools out of a total of fifteen schools.  Pleasanton is an upper middle class community 
in the San Francisco Bay Area that places g
reat emphasis on academic achievement and devotes 
available resources to benefit all students.  Donlon is currently focusing on providing strong systems 
of supports for students' academic, social, and behavioral needs through studying student data in 
grade
 
level collaborative teams. One area that makes Donlon special is our inclusion of all students. 
Several general education classes serve as "buddy classes" for our moderate
-
severe Special Day 
Class students, joining them in recess and some class activities
. Our parent
-
volunteer led Abilities 
Awareness week early in the fall gave all students the opportunity to experience simulations of the 
work and energy students with differing abilities bring to their school day. Students also had the 
chance to use wheelc
hairs during their PE class to navigate obstacles and play games. Our 
playground has accessible play equipment to encourage inclusive play during our recess times.
 
 
Our school mission can be summed up with the acronym "HELPS": Donlon is an inclusive commun
ity 
empowering all to be Healthy, Empathetic, Life
-
long learners with a Positive mindset to become 
Successful global citizens. Our very dedicated and highly qualified staff uses district adopted 
standards
-
based curriculum combined with effective instructio
nal strategies to meet the needs of 
our diverse student population. We use continuous assessment and data to inform our instruction 
and develop learning goals for our students. We are focused on increasing levels of learning through 
engaging instruction, s
tudent collaboration, and appropriate interventions. We help students learn 
expected behaviors through our Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports, including the use of 
a district
-
approved social and emotional learning curriculum. We also tie in our c
ity and district 
wide adopted Community of Character Traits (Responsibility, Compassion, Self
-
Discipline, Honesty, 
Respect, and Integrity) across all areas of the curriculum.
 
 
Parent and community involvement play an integral role in the success of Donlon.
  
Our Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) works closely with staff to support and enrich our school programs.  We 
also work with outside community groups who provide support for our school programs and offer 
unique learning opportunities for our students.  At
 
Donlon, we are proud of the commitment by 
our students, staff, families, and community members in making our school a place where children 
thrive and are given multiple opportunities for success.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is 
required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (
LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported i
n an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa
/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community 
members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks use
d in the core curriculum at Donlon Elementary School are aligned to the California State Standards. Instructional materials a
re selected 
from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The distric
t follows the State Board of 
Education's six
-
year adoption cycle for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, the Pleasanton Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a publi
c hearing to certify the extent to which textbooks 
and instructional materials have been provided to students.  The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution 2019
-
2020.004 which certifies as required by 
Education Code §60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional
 
materials were provided to all students,including English learners, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take home, and (2) sufficient text
books and instructional material
s 
were provided to each student, including English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent 
with the cycles and content 
of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.
 
 
In
 
addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materials 
used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula.  During the 2019
-
20 school year, Pleasanton Unified School District provided each
 
student, including English learners, enrolled in a 
visual/performing arts class with a textbook or instructional materials to use in class and to take home.  These materials co
mplied with the state's content 
standards and curriculum frameworks.

aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities);

fulfill Senate Bill 187 requirements.  Components of this plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification
 
of dangerous pupil 
procedures, disaster response
 
procedures, procedures for safe arrival and departure from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy.  The 
school's most recent school safety plan was updated, and reviewed with and approved by school site council on November 12, 20
19. The s
chool 
community has monthly drills to practice various aspects of the disaster response plan; ongoing feedback is solicited from st
aff and improvements are 
constantly made . The Pleasanton Police Department is invited to observe and give feedback on at lea
st one intruder drill per year, and the Livermore
-
Pleasanton Fire Department is invited to observe and give feedback on at least one full evacuation drill per year.
