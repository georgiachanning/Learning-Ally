By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Los Alamitos Unified 
School District has always emphasized the importance of a clean, safe environment for learning. 
The environment of each campus is a matter of pride for students, staff and parents. Several schools have planted 
individual gardens, organized workrooms, and p
lanned workdays for students and parents to enhance the facility. To 
ensure that our facilities are in good repair condition, custodians at each site perform monthly inspections and the District
 
maintenance crew places safety as the number one priority. Lo
s Alamitos Elementary School was built in 1952. Overall, 
the school is in very good condition. It is clean and well maintained. Voters within the District boundaries approved a local
 
bond in 2008. Due to the passage of the Measure K Bond in 2008, all schoo
l sites within the District were modernized. The 
modernization work included the installation of new roofs, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, fire alarm and data systems. The 
doors, windows and flooring were replaced along with all new restroom fixtures. Moderni
zation began at Los Alamitos 
Elementary School in June of 2010 and concluded in August of 2011 resulting in new infrastructure and the modernization 
of all buildings.
 
 
In the summer of 2020
-
2021 Los Alamitos Elementary School will be at the 10 year mark of
 
being modernized with 
Measure K.
 
 
LAE will be redoing the parking lot, blacktop/recess area, adding a bathroom with staff and students 
restrooms, and repainting the school and roof.
 
 
Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities ma
y 
be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for 
students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the admini
stration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successf
ully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Los Alamitos Elementary School offers a variety of ways for 
parents to be involved at the school and in their students 
education.
 
 
 
Some ways parents are encouraged to be involved:
 

 
PTA 
-
 
The PTA, Parent Teacher Association, meets monthly and is involved in putting together and running 
events at LAE to promote commu
nity. Some of these events include Camp LAE, Movie Night, Carnival, 
Fundraisers, and many more events. The parents also help to support vital programs at LAE with the fundraising 
and revenue they bring into the school.
 

 
FLAE 
-
 
The Friends of LAE is a group 
of dedicated parents and community members that run fundraisers to pay 
for vital programs at LAE. FLAE supports the media center, maker
-
space, and technology improvements at LAE. 
100% of the revenue generated from FLAE goes to support programs and technolo
gy at LAE.
 

 
Room Coordinator 
-
 
Parents are able to volunteer at anytime in their students rooms and the room coordinator 
helps to run special programs in the classroom that could not be completed by the teacher alone. Parent 
support in the classroom allows 
LAE teachers to focus on the educational goals of their students.

This is the advisory committee for our English Language Learners. This committee meets bi
-
monthly

community members, and parents that give input to LAE on how best to direct our interventions and school 
safety plans to ensure students safety and academic succ
ess.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
The primary areas of focus for staff development are the 

(CGI), Readers & Writers Workshop, Reading Foundations for the Common Core (RFCC), Thinking Maps and Depth and 
Complexity. Student data is collected via District benchmarks and various formal a
ssessments, such as CAASPP and 
Fountas & Pinnel Leveled Reading Assessments, to determine instructional needs for teachers. The District provides annual 
training to ensure accurate calibration in the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in
 
order to assess 
site vs. district
-
wide areas of concerns.
 
 
Professional development is delivered by way of release time for teachers in the all of the Signature Practices. Teachers 
new to the Los Alamitos Unified School District are placed on a five
-
year p
rofessional development plan. Teachers are 
placed into cohorts according to the number of years with the District and attend professional development sessions. 
Teachers are also released to attend pre
-
approved workshops and conferences with the expectation
 
of disseminating their 
findings by way of instructional networking. The District also provides content specific training when needed by 
departments or grade level teams.
 
 
Teachers are supported through on
-
going, in
-
class coaching by District TOSAs. Site ad
ministrators provide regular, ongoing 
feedback by conducting classroom observations, setting individual goals for teachers, and by providing time for teachers 
to collaborate and review data within grade level teams, subject teams and departments. Teachers 
are provided 
opportunities to participate in instructional networking where teachers observe other teachers and debrief on the 
instructional strategies employed within the lesson. The practice of instructional networking is cross
-
curricular and non
-
evaluat
ive.
