By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Linden Elementary School is in the Linden Unified School District, a medium
-
sized rural district serving approximately 2,250 
students as of November, 2019, in grades K
-
12. The District is located in the eastern part of San
 
Joaquin County and is 
comprised of four elementary schools, one comprehensive high school, and one alternative high school. Linden 
Elementary School is a transitional kindergarten through fourth grade elementary school with an enrollment of 431

proficient readers, writers, and mathematicians as measured by the California Common Core Standards Assessments and 
district benchmarks. We are comm
itted to provide a network of support so all students will achieve these goals, with the 
emphasis, "Where Children Start Their Education".
 
The educational needs of students are addressed through differentiated classroom instruction, adherence to daily Engl
ish 
language development for our English learners and by providing intervention to those students who are academically at
-
risk. Students will be stimulated to learn through a wide variety of activities and strategies that address the needs of all 
learners.
 
LUSD Instructional Norms consist of Learning Objectives, Student Engagement, Questioning Techniques, and 
Content Area Writing. The District is focusing on five major engagement strategies for the school year including, but not 
limited to, Structured Pair 
Share, Random Call on, Whiteboards,. Students explaining their Thinking, and 
Interactive/Reciprocal Read. The District has also committed to implementing Kagan Engagement Strategies to support 
Instructional Norms.
 
LUSD principals deliver professional devel
opment at monthly district wide training on Instructional Norms and current 
practices.  Professional Development is also provided at the site level by principal and other staff resources within the 
district. Instructional coaches play a significant role in
 
staff professional learning.The goal is to provide training to help 
staff become experts in our Instructional Norms and Student Engagement Strategies resulting in student academic 
success.

Linden Elementary provides a variety of programs and activities that promote parent involvement, a priority at Linden 
Elementary. Nearly all classrooms have one to three parent volunteers to support classroom teachers.  Parents are 
encouraged to attend PTC
 
(Parent Teacher Club) to gain knowledge of school fundraisers and work with principal, along 
with teachers, to determine ways to support student learning. Parents are encouraged to ask questions or make 
constructive suggestions. Parent meetings present op
portunities to learn about student support programs, school 
operation and educational services through presentations by the superintendent and community program 
representatives. Parents assist with Star Lab, picture day, and fundraisers that include annual
 
fundraising dinner, walk

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Linden Elementary School views safety as a top priority.   The plan includes specific information about evacuation 
routes, drills and staff responsibilities.  All staff members review the school safety procedures at the beginning of each 
school year.  
Safety signals and drills are practiced with the children on a regular basis, with fire drills meeting the once a 
month requirement.  Each classroom has a safety backpack with emergency supplies.  Backpacks accompany teachers and 
classes during drills and 
on field trips.  All teachers carry a 2 way radio for quick communication and to receive current 
information.  We provide close student supervision before, during, and after school.   Safety concerns of classroom or 
building maintenance are reported to the
 
office by staff and parents. Concerns are acted upon immediately by District 
maintenance crew, site custodians, or outside contractors.  The Extended Learning Program adheres to all Safety Plan 
protocol and practice emergency drill on the same schedule as
 
the regular school day.  Linden Elementary participates in 
the Positive Behavior Intervention Support Program to assure that student social and emotional safety is maintained and 
improved.  The District has an ongoing Distinct Safety Committee that meets 
quarterly to make decisions of District safety 
procedures, provide current information on best current safety practices, and  hear from safety experts that share 
information and experiences of a successful safety plan. The District has implemented " Share 
911".

new an
d seasoned, to assist with classroom engagement strategies, Common Core Standard implementation through 
curriculum and support materials, and organization.  This year, Linden Unified School District has focused on preparing 
teachers for the Next Generation
 
Science Standards (NGSS) understanding and implementation. In preparation of the 
NGSS curriculum adoption and implementation, teachers have received NGSS training from the San Joaquin Office of 
Education Science Department. The training began in 2016 and 
has continued district wide through this current school 
year.  The SJCOE professional development workshops have been presented to various district
-
wide grade levels by a 
single SJCOE science department expert. Teachers then breakout in grade levels to col
laborate and plan units for NGSS 
instruction. In addition, the district has developed a science cadre made up of volunteer grade level teacher leaders to 
help further the NGSS professional development at sites and district grade level meetings during early
 
release 
Wednesdays.  Linden Elementary has three teacher representative in the district team participating in the NGSS adoption 
process. The district is in piloting phase currently.

al development in other areas.Teachers 
representing all grades within the district volunteered to develop math pacing guides while working with curriculum 
publishers during summer months and throughout the school year. All teachers, including classroom, Re
source and SDC, 
received training's including Read 180/System 44, Daily 5, AERIES, Accelerated Reader, Common Core ELA/Math, ELA/ELD 
Designated instruction, and Special Education training, including Assault Behaviors, and Opposition Defiance Disorder.    
I
ntervention aides receive professional development on intervention programs and implementation at monthly meetings 
with the reading intervention teacher. They also are encouraged to attend outside professional development. For 
example, San Joaquin County D
own's Syndrome training, and para professional training.
 
Linden Unified School District  has adopted Instructional Norms and specific engagement strategies to support them.Those 
strategies are use of white boards, students explaining their answers, random 
selection. structured pair share, and 
interpretive/reciprocal read.
 
 
These growth opportunities are specifically determined by district goals and implementation monitored through 
superintendent, Educational Services Director, and principal walk through's, 
teacher
-
principal meetings, grade level 
collaboration with principal or intervention teacher facilitating, Academic Conferences, and analyzing student data to 
determine effective and strategies.  District wide teacher professional development is presented 
by site principals once a 
month to ensure knowledge of  District Instructional Norm strategies are taught and engagement strategies are
