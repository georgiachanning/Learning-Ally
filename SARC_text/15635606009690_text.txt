School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Given the age of the campus the school is in very good shape.  There are no leaks of any kind on the campus and the 
facility undergoes ongoing ins
pections throughout the year.  Bathrooms are cleaned daily as well as rooms and common 
areas.  Both staff and students are committed to providing a safe and welcoming campus for all to enjoy.  Over the past 
two years a regular replacement schedule has been
 
kept for upgrading out
-
dated HVAC systems for the classrooms.  The 
plan provides for each classroom to receive a new HVAC unit by 2021.
 
Mountain View Middle School has been retrofitted of all existing light fixtures on campus to coordinate with the 
installation of a new sun solar system that was completed in 2018.

through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019

Parent Involvement
 

Parents have demonstrated pride and cooperation through their participation in our fundraisers, School Site Council 
meetings, English
 
Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meetings, Back to School Night, Open House, and our parent
-
teacher conference week.  We have also created family movie nights in which parents and students watch movies out 
under the stars in the Fall and Spring months. 
 
A newly added Fall Harvest Festival takes place the last week in October.
 
During our parent
-
teacher conference week, we have one night that teachers stay late to accomodate parents that have 
longer working hours.  We currently have calendared evening pare
nt meetings scheduled throughout the year, focusing 
on various subjects. These meetings are tailored to assist parents with understanding how to help their students succeed 
in their academics. We are also having conversations with our School Site Council a
nd English Language Advisory 
Committee parents to establish a site
-
specific parent involvement policy. Throughout the school year we have academic 
and sports assemblies to allow parents an opportunity to see their child recognized for outstanding achieveme
nt in these 
specific areas.

providing transportation of students in the event of a natural disaster that precludes using the school site as a shelter

For the past four years, Mt. View Middle School has expanded its Academic Master Schedule to provide additional 
electives and academic support for its students.  Currently we have zero period classes which allow students to take core 
classes before the reg
ular school day starts so they may take regularly scheduled elective classes.  Zero period courses 
also provide students additional opportunities to receive academic remediation and tutoring.  Additional learning 
opportunities for students are available du
ring after school tutoring sessions as well as Summer School opportunities.

The District Office provides multiple opportunities for teachers and support staff to attend professional development days 
throughout the year.  Additional opportunities for teachers to plan and review curriculum are planned throughout the 
year so as to as
sess curriculum tools and program.  With the adoption of a new math textbook series, the math department 
has been given multiple days throughout the year to review pacing and assessment calendars in order to give feedback 
and recommendations to the princip
al for curriculum changes.  The same process will occur once the new ELA textbook 
series is adopted for the 2016
-
2017 school year. History is currently piloting two programs for future adoption.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) collaboration time 
is held twice per month in order for teachers to analyze 
student assessment data, plan instruction and collaborate on best instructional practices.  Teachers meet within their 
departments during this time and are given an opportunity to share out with fell
ow teachers in order to facilitate cross
-
curricular instruction.
 
 
In addition to the PLC days, the master schedule has been developed to provide common prep periods for departments 
in order to allow additional department planning and student learning discu
ssions.  These additional opportunities for 
teachers has been very productive for the Mt. View teaching staff and has led to greater opportunities for departmental 
collaboration and ultimately increased student learning.
