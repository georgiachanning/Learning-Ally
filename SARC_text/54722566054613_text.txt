By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Highland Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for students, 
staff, and volunteers.  Sufficient space is provided for s
tudents and staff to support teaching and learning.  This includes 
space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms.  To assist our school in this effort, the district uses a 
facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Of
fice of Public School Construction.  The results of this 
survey are available below.  Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by 
speaking with the school principal.
 
 
The school meets most or all standards of go
od repair. Deficiencies noted, if any, are not significant and/or impact a very 
small area of the school. The school is maintained in good repair with a number of non
-
critical deficiencies noted. These 
deficiencies are isolated, and/or resulting from minor
 
wear and tear, and/or in the process of being mitigated. The school 
is not in good repair. Some deficiencies noted are critical and/or widespread. Repairs and/or additional maintenance are 
necessary in several areas of the school site. The school faciliti
es are in poor condition. Deficiencies of various degrees 
have been noted throughout the site. Major repairs and maintenance are necessary throughout the campus.

There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to, attending school 
functions, participating in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteering in classrooms, and chaperoning field trips. Parents
 
may also serve on advisory committees and leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learners Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), School Safety Committee, Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS Team) and School Site Council 
(SSC). Additional
 
opportunities for parental involvement also exist at the district level.
 
 
We have planned Family Nights, which are free, that have planned activities where students and parents create positive 
memories together.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of 
students and staff is a primary concern of Highland Elementary School.  Campus
-
wide supervision ensures 
students are safe on school grounds before, during, and after school. Entrances to school grounds are secured or 
monitored during the school day.  All v
isitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on 
campus.  Persons wishing to volunteer in the classrooms must complete the appropriate forms and meet with the school 
administrator prior to being allowed to volunteer.
 
 
The Com
prehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical fa
cilities, and communication with staff and students. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated 
as needed, and fully compliant with federal and state regulations. An updated copy is available to the public at the school 
office or on the district's websi
te.  The Comprehensive Safe School Plan is reviewed with the school staff and School Site 
Council.  School Site Council approves the plan prior to it being officially submitted to the District for VUSD Board approva
l.
 
 

an includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  Emergency 
preparedness drills are conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff: professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and literacy instruction and other areas as indicated by school data.  Our 
district provides professional 
development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroom level dependent on teacher goals. The 
district 
provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qualified teachers in our area, twenty perc


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robu
st 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Certificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is
 
a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day workshop 
on student engagement and cooperativ
e learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout the year via weekly meetings with their a
ssigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novice teachers on classroom tours, and assis
ting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their instructional practice.   Mentors and teache
rs on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credenti
al 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one mentor support as may be needed in the c
ase of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.
