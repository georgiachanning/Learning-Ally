By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The LEA takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the LEA uses
 
a 
facility inspection tool developed by the State of 
California OPSC. The results are available at the school office.
 
Year and month in which data were collected: August 2018
 
Facilities: Condition of school facilities meets Education Code Sections: 17014 Necessary repairs, renewals, and 
replacements: enforce
ment; plan preparation certification; 17032.5 Portable classrooms; leases, conditions; 17010.75(a) 
Maintenance of facilities; and 17089(b) lease of portable classrooms; amount;
 
maintenance; repairs; costs.
 
 
Teaching and Learning space: Wilcox has 37 classr
ooms, an assembly room/cafeteria, and a library/media center located 
in the main building. Included are 16 portable classrooms. A staff workroom is located in a portable as a teacher resource 
room. Our second computer lab is also located in one of the port
ables. A staff lunchroom is located in the first
-
grade wing. 
Student and staff restrooms are adequately located throughout the campus and are kept clean and in good working order. 
Wilcox maintains a Kindergarten playground that is shared with two preschool
 
classes and our TK class and a 1st through

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Helen M. Wilcox Elementary School values parents! Parents are invited to participate in the school's activities and in their 
child's education in a variety of ways. Parents and guardians are given the opportunity 
to work in a mutually supportive 
and respectful partnership with the school to help their child succeed. We encourage our parents to volunteer in the 
classroom and on field trips, as well as attend all school events. We have a volunteer policy in the schoo
l office.  Some of 
those events are Parent Education Nights, Meet and Greet (beginning of the year), Reading Pals, Open House, 
Parent/Teacher conferences, parent meetings, Muffins for Moms, and Doughnuts for Dads.
 
 
Helen Wilcox benefits from an active Pare
nt Teacher Group (PTG).  The PTG works with the community on various 
fundraisers and supports student activities.  Parents are encouraged to serve on the School Site Council (SSC).  Parents of 
English Learners are encouraged to serve on the English Learner
 
Advisory Committee (ELAC/DELAC).  Parents are also 
encouraged to monitor student attendance and homework completion, participate in school activities, volunteer and 
attend meetings.
