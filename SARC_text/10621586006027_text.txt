By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Mission Statement
 
The administration, teachers, staff, parents 
and interested community members will strive to enable each student to 
develop the academic skills necessary to be successful throughout their educational and professional careers with an 
understanding that reading, writing and mathematics are the core of 
this success.  This will be accomplished in a nurturing 
environment that builds responsibility and respect, as well as fosters a sense of giving and duty through service learning.
 
 
Principal's Message
 
At Fremont School, we are proud of the accomplishments 
of our students and staff, and we continue to look for ways to 
enhance student achievement.   Our students learn in an environment that is positive, safe and clean.  Character education 
is a critical component of our program and includes a substantial serv
ice learning component.   We provide opportunities 
to learn outside of the classroom through events like Science Olympiad, Odyssey of the Mind, Lego Robotics, Peach 
Blossom, Student Council, and service learning where students apply and expand what they ha
ve learned in a different 
setting. Fremont School has an outstanding after school program that is in high demand.  Students in this program have 
the opportunity to join clubs centered around leadership, sports and special interests.
 
 
We believe that all st
udents can achieve at high levels and we have in place many programs to facilitate student learning.  
We use assessments in mathematics, English/language arts, and science to adjust our instruction to meet the needs of 
our students. In addition to regular 
instruction, we provide intervention to our struggling students in reading and math, 
as well as advanced learning opportunities for students who are working above grade level. These opportunities take place 
during the school day and are facilitated by our 
certificated tutor, teachers, and qualified instructional assistants. Our 
focus for staff development this year continues to perfect our best instructional practices, analyze our data in achievement 
teams, and focus on meeting mastery of ELA and math stand
ards, while ensuring all sub
-
groups make progress towards 
mastery as well.  Teachers have participated in professional development centered around mathematics, language arts, 
and writing.  Staff also has received on
-
going training from our district technol
ogy coach to embed technology into lesson 

have included a blended learning approach built into our instructional day that earned us the dist
inguished California Gold 
Ribbon Award.   In addition, we work in Professional Learning Communities to improve instruction through analysis of 
local assessment data and collaborative planning.
 
 
We strive to create an environment that nurtures strong charac
ter and provides a firm academic foundation that will lead 
to success for the rest of their educational careers, their professional careers and  their personal lives. We are recipients
 
of the  Bonner Center for Character and Civic Education Award for imple
menting an outstanding character education 
program.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Fremont School was constructed in 1938. It is well maintained. Our custodial and maintenance staffs work hard to make 
sure that our students atten
d school in an environment that is safe and conducive to learning.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessm
ent of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair.
 
If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the W
illiams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page survey form used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to inspect them. They used a
 
survey, called
 

answered the questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as 
of the date of the r
eport. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school and grounds are safe and secure. Staff members monitor the playground before school, at lunch and during 
recess. We hold students to a high standard of behavior, as demonstrated through our SOAR program. We also supervise 
students as they leave 
campus in the afternoon. All visitors enter through the office and sign in and out.  We practice fire 
drills and procedures for other school emergencies, and we review and revise the School Safety Plan annually. The School 
Safety Plan was last reviewed and
 
discussed with site stakeholders on November 14, 2019.

daily basis. This site also has several instructional aides that work closely with students.
 
 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE): Teachers or parents nominate students for GATE. They are assessed using the Otis 
Le
nnon Scholastic Aptitude test, and the Naglieri Nonverbal Scholastic Aptitude test. Students who qualify for GATE 
receive differentiated instruction within the regular classroom. In addition, identified GATE students have extended 
learning opportunities su

Primary areas of focus:
 
With the transition to Common Core State Standards, our professional development has centered around Common Core 
training in English language arts, mathematics, ELD, and 
technology.   We have contracted with Tulare County Office of 
Education for ELD, iReady/Ready Classroom Math, and Benchmark Advance.  Teachers are currently working on lesson 
design that incorporates checking for understanding through the use of justificat
ions and writing and as well as explaining 
mathematical reasoning.  Trainings have been completed through the use of half days, Early Release Days/after school 
workshops, conferences, and in
-
service days.
 
 
Support:
 
Teachers are supported through the use of
 
a full
-
time guidance instructional specialist, principal, and district technology 
coach.  In addition, math, ELA, and ELD consultants are also supportive to classroom teachers needs.  Early Release days 
allow teachers time to meet in Professional Learning
 
Communities to analyze data and design lessons.  Through the use 
of co
-
teaching, teachers design lessons together, co
-
teach, and debrief.  This provides feedback to teachers regarding 
instructional pedagogy that supports our areas of focus. New teachers p
articipate in the Induction program and are given 
additional professional development.
 
 
Data:
 
Currently we are utilizing data from DIBELS, ELPAC, iReady, standards
-
based assessments, in addition to grade level 
assessments to determine areas of need.
