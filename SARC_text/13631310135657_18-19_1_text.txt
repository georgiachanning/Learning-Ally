Most importantly, attendance is critical to academic achievement and 
regular daily attendance is a priority at Heber Elementary School District. 
Student attendance is carefully monitored by Student Information Services 
(SIS) to identify those students struggling with excessive absences. Regular attendance at Heber Elementary and Dogwood Elementary are a 
necessary part of the learning process and is critical to academic success. 

Attendance, tardy, and truancy policies are clearly stated, consistently 

enforced, and consequences fairly administered. Parents are advised

The California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) includes computer-based and paper-pencil assessments. The computer-
based assessments are the Smarter Balanced English Language Arts/Literacy (ELA) and Mathematics tests, administered to grades three through eight 

and eleven. There is also the optional Standards-based Tests in Spanish (STS) for Reading/Language Arts (RLA).
A new science assessment based on the Next Generation Science Standards for California Public Schools (CA NGSS) has been developed. The 


reporting period.The Smarter Balanced Assessment System utilizes computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks that allow students to show what they know and are 
able to do. Smarter Balanced summative assessment results include student scores, achievement levels, and descriptors that describe performance. 

These assessment results are only one of several tools used to measure a student™s academic performance in ELA/Literacy and mathematics. Smarter 
Balanced assessment results are most appropriately interpreted alongside other available information about a student™s academic achievement, including 
such measures as District assessments, classroom assignments and grades, classrooms tests, report cards, and teacher feedback.This table displays the percent of students who met or exceeded state standards in English Language Arts/Literacy (grades 3-8 and 11) and Math 
(grades 3-8 and 11) for the past three school years, and Science (grades 5, 8, and 10) for 2015 and 2016. 
The following table displays information on student achievement by student groups for the school in ELA and Mathematics with all grades combined 
(grades three through eight and eleven).Note: ELA test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the California Alternate Assessment. The ﬁPercent Met or Exceededﬂ 
is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total 

number of students who met the standard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.Double dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for 
statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of 
students tested is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated 
using only students who received scores.California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
