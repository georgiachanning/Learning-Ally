School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The MES Mission: At Mariposa Elementary, we are passionate about our students and their success and we work toward 
building stronger relationships with them as they grow and become amazing, KIND human beings. All of our ME
S family 
members work together everyday to make our school the best it can be.
 
 
The MES Profile: Mariposa Elementary School is located in the county seat of rural Mariposa County in the picturesque 
Sierra Foothills. The facility is arranged over three leve
ls of a hillside, housing 425 students in Transitional Kindergarten 
through 8th grade. Mariposa County Severely Handicapped classes also known as Monarch Academy (SH), Behavior 
Intervention Classes (BIC), and MES TK
-
8 classrooms share a campus with Maripos
a County High School. The school serves 
children of the town proper in addition to an attendance area that extends out into the nearby mountain area. Almost 
80% of our students come to school by bus. There is a strong partnership of parent volunteers, teac
hers, classified staff, 
senior citizen (SPICE) volunteers and community agencies to meet the academic, emotional, physical and social needs of 
students. An active Parent Club supplements teacher instructional budgets and provides for field trips and activi
ties 
centered around the arts throughout the year. Local merchants, especially Pioneer Market, provide incentives and funding 
for student achievement awards, cultural opportunities, and community service projects. Our after school program 

ASES) serves approximately 60 students. Community partners also provide for curriculum
-
related 
instruction within walking distance.

20)
 
 
We encourage all parent
s and community members to become involved in MES. We require volunteers to be fingerprinted 
and TB tested to ensure the safety of our students and staff. Some of the activities our volunteers engage in are music, 
arts, assemblies, celebrations, tutoring, 
assisting teachers, and Parent Club activities. MES is an important part of the 
community and the community is an important part of MES, especially our parents.
 
We encourage families to be:
 
Teachers of their students at home
 
Supporters of our school and of
 
public education
 
Advocates for their own and other students, and
 
Decision
-
makers in school policy and practice
 
 
To be fully family
-
friendly, our school will provide:
 
1. A welcoming environment
 
Standards of welcoming behavior apply to all staff, including 
office staff, campus supervisors, bus drivers, and custodians.
 
Visitors and callers are greeted immediately and politely and can get information easily from office staff and/or our school 
website.
 
2. Programs and activities to engage families in improving 
student achievement
 
Current student work is displayed throughout the building, so that visitors can understand the purpose of the work and 
the high standards it is to meet.
 
Programs and activities help families understand what their students are learning a
nd promote high standards
 
The school reports to parents about student progress and how teachers, parents, and community members can work 
together to make improvements
 
3. Strong relationships between teachers and families
 
The school welcomes new families, o
ffers tours, and introduces them to staff.
 
Teachers and families can meet face
-
to
-
face and get to know each other through class meetings and class observations.
 
Teachers and advisors make personal contact with the families.
 
4. Opportunities for families to
 
develop their skills, self
-
confidence and contacts.
 
The school is open and accessible; it is easy for parents to meet with staff and share concerns.

Safe 
School Vision: The Vision is to create a safe, peaceful, curriculum
-
rich learning environment that provides stability, 
flexibility, consistency and direction for all students to enable them to realize their full learning potential. Our Safe Sch
ool 
Goal is 
to maintain an orderly and purposeful place in which students and staff are able to learn and teach without the 
threat of physical and psychological harm.
 
 
Safe School Mission Statement: The administration and staff of Mariposa Elementary School will creat
e and maintain a 
safe school environment for students and staff. We will provide a safe learning environment where staff and students are 
able to reach their educational goals. Students will be held accountable for their behavior and recognized for their 
a
chievements. Staff will take an active part in maintaining a safe school environment by participating in school activities 
to give students a sense of belonging in the school community. The administration will monitor the school site and 
infrastructure to 
ensure that school grounds are free from hazards. Additional information regarding the School Safety 
Plan is available upon request. The plan is updated and reviewed annually with staff and community members.
 
 
Our staff meets at least once per month to dis
cuss safety concerns. Safety concerns are shared by designated staff at 
district Facilities Meetings on a regular basis. Our last Safety Plan was reviewed, discussed and updated and approved by 
our by our School Site Council on February 27, 2019. Work will
 
begin soon to again review, discuss and update the Safety 
Plan for this school year.

Mariposa Elementary School benefits from ongoing professional development (PD) from a number of sources that fit into 
three categories: district, site, and staff. District PD is provided through trainings that are provided through Site 
Leadership, by commi
ttee, and through PD days that are built into the district calendar. Site PD is provided on Grade Level 
Collaboration Days and Early Release Mondays and is driven by site Problem of Practice, district guidance, and needs 
identified by staff. This year, our
 
entire district will be attending training for Nurtured Heart and Amplify Science. Site PD 
is delivered by individual staff members, the Principal, district personnel, support staff and guests. When expertise in an 
area of identified need is not available
 
at the site or district level, staff research best practices and sometimes participate 
in off
-
site trainings. Staff bring knowledge and skills back to the school to share in a Teacher of Teachers model. Individual 
staff who have specific needs work with t
he principal and/or veteran staff to improve in the areas of identified needs. 
District funded mentor teachers, coaches and veteran teacher assistance has been implemented above and beyond 
induction coaching to assist new teachers as they enter and navigat
e their first years in the profession. Data is collected 
through ongoing, formative, and summative assessments. Aeries is our primary tool for collecting and sharing data for 
staff, student, and stakeholder use.
