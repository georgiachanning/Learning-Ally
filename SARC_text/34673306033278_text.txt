By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
School Vision and Mission:
 
Mission: We will create a nurturing learning environment where all students are safe and respected.  The staff will provide 
guidance, positive encouragement, and bring Common Core 
knowledge to all students. This will develop critical thinking, 
problem solving skills, and collaborative peer relationships in order to produce lifelong learners and productive citizens in
 
society.
 
 
Vision:
 
Working with parents and community members, Whit
e Rock Elementary School will provide all students with equal access 
to highly qualified teaching staff, research
-
based first instruction, and targeted interventions to develop skills needed to 
make a measurable and consistent growth in all academic areas.
 
 
School & Community Profile:
 
White Rock Elementary School is a Transitional Kindergarten through 5th grade Title 1, Program Improvement site. Due 
to low academic growth of our students, White Rock qualified for a School Improvement Grant. We are currently
 
in year 
3 of our State improvement Grant.  Of our 450 students, 237 (47%) speak another language at home. 32% of our students 
speak Spanish. 92% of our students qualify for free and reduced lunch due to their socioeconomic status. For the next 
year, White
 
Rock is a Community Eligibility Provision site, which means that all students will receive free breakfast and 
lunch.
 
 
White Rock operates on a traditional schedule. During the first month of the 2019
-
20 school year,  499 students were 
enrolled in 
grades Preschool through fifth. Our largest ethnic group, 48%, is Hispanic/Latino. Significant subgroups include 
Whites at 24% and African Americans at 17.64%. An Average of 80 1st through 6th grade students are enrolled in the After 
School Education safet
y (ASES) until 6:00 pm.
 
 
Through our constant review of assessment data from Systematic Instruction in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and 
Sight Words (SIPPS), Envision, Benchmark, i Ready and Lexia, teachers identify students who need additional academic
 
support (or intervention). These targeted students receive intense intervention using research based and school board 
adopted instructional materials. Some of these interventions are provided during the school day, additional learning 
opportunities may be
 
offered before or after school.
 
 
Our Title 1 Academic Coach, and Intervention teachers work with students in small groups to address gaps in concepts. 
They also work with teachers to plan instruction, and assist with data analysis.  The School Improvement
 
Grant (SIG) brings 
to our site an Assistant Principal, Marriage Family Therapist, Intervention Teacher and a site based substitute. Community 
members (like the Rotary, Metro Fire Station 61, Intel, Soil Born Farms, Kaiser) support our students with donati
ons and 
the gift of their time.

Parents express the desire to understand their children's school experience. White Rock uses many of our resources to 
establish and maintain relationships with our parents through School Site Council (SSC), English Language
 
Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), TItle 1 meetings, coffee with the Principal, family events, home visits, informational classes for parents,
 
and volunteer opportunities. We tailor our outreach in response to conversations that staff and administration have with
 
parents as well as insight we receive through Site Council.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most 
Recent Year)
 
 
White Rock Elementary was originally constructed in 1960 and is comprised of 24 classrooms, a multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, library, staff lounge, computer lab, a small group of instruction buildings and three playgrounds. The 
school was reno
vated in 2009 and is in good repair with no planned repairs needed.  As we plan on expanding to include 
a preschool program, there will be a need to add a playground facility for preschool use. Through Measure H funds, the 
irrigation to our school garden w
as added. Through the County of Sacramento, we also have a specialized portable garden 
for small spaces.
 
 
The principal works with the custodial staff of one (1) full time and two (2) part time custodians to ensure that the cleanin
g 
of the school is mainta
ined to provide for a clean and safe school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that 
the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority is given to 
emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note 
that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection 
process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matchin
g funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting,
 
and floor 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State prior
ity: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school consults with 
parents and community members by soliciting parent and staff suggestions in the allocation of 
funds and in the design, planning and implementation of programs. Parent representatives are encouraged to participate 
in our School Site Council (SSC), English L
anguage Advisory Committee (ELAC), and to volunteer at events and in the 
classroom. Monthly newsletters, written in Spanish and English, are posted in a variety of ways to inform our community. 
Staff responds quickly to parent input and suggestions.  White
 
Rock holds public meetings a minimum of twice per year 
to which all parents are invited, to explain programs and activities offered at school. We also train parents on ways in 
which they can engage more with the school. Parents are invited to Coffee with 
the Principal each month to discuss 
concerns and learn more about the school. Parents are encouraged to support our efforts to begin a Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA).
 
 
Parents are encouraged to attend Back to School Night in order to receive materials ab
out their child's classroom 
expectations. Information is also provided in the form of monthly newsletters. Parents are invited to volunteer in the 
classrooms. They are also provided with resources and information through parent workshops, district parent w
orkshops, 
district parent summits and the summer parent academy. They also provide feedback to the school site and the district 
through the Title 1 Survey, participation in ELAC and SSC and bi
-
annual Title 1 meetings.
 
 
Our school's Site Council includes pa
rents who meet with staff to stay informed on school progress and provide input on 
programs and budgeting. In addition, our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets at least three times a year 
to discuss ways in which White Rock Elementary and the 
community can work together to support English Language 
learners in their academic growth.

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
White Rock strives for a safe and clean environment.  Restrooms and eating facilities are cleaned daily. Classrooms are 
cleaned at least every second day. Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and resolved. Safety and 
E
mergency plans are reviewed each fall and spring with our School Site Council. The Safety Plan was approved in 
September 2019. The community is encouraged to use our facility, including evening meetings of various community 
organizations such as Folsom Cor
dova Parents Early Readiness Playgroup, Sacramento Theater Company,  Saturday 
Russian School and the Supplemental Tutoring and After School Education and Safety (ASES).  There were seven (7) student 
accidents reported at our school in the 2018
-
2019 school 
year.
 
 
Reducing vandalism and after
-
hours problems are still a top priority, a challenge that has decreased since renovation of 
the site, and we are handling more effectively.  Our community, especially immediate neighbors continue to watch out 
for our cam
pus  to curb any incidents of vandalism and graffiti. This year White Rock put in 12 new cameras to support 
vandalism and graffiti on campus.

Assessment (BTSA) to provide an induction program for qualified new teachers. We support our teachers in pursuing 
National Board Certification and currently have over 44 National Board Certifi
ed teachers within the district. The district 
is involved with both Administrator Training Program (ATP) and Teacher Training, which increase the capacity of all staff 
to deliver a standards

Counseling & Support Staff
 
 
It is the goal of 
White Rock Elementary to assist students in their social and personal development as well as academics. 
The school gives special attention to students who experience achievement problems, difficulty coping with personal and 
family problems, trouble with de
cision making, or handling peer pressure.  In addition, we are using staff from our Special 
Friends/ Partners in Prevention (PIP) Elementary Intervention Program (EIP) and Marriage Family Therapists (MFT) for 
assistance in these areas.
