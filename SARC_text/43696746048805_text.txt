By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes great 
efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 

ies department at (408) 423
-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest prior
ity.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to
 
develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school buildin
g components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort 
to spend taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in u
pdated technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambiti
ous roof 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and sec
urity systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews 
campus, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging
 
play structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
The main campus of Bracher School was built in 1958. Portables were 
added in 1997 for class size reduction and buildings 
were modernized in 2002. This school has 31 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

ntal Involvement 
-
 
 
Bracher Elementary School actively seeks and welcomes parent and community involvement in the life of the school. 
School climate is developed through a cooperative effort of the school staff, Parent Teacher Association (PTA), School Sit
e 
Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and parent volunteers.
 
 
Parents are involved in many different capacities. Bracher parents participate in and/or directly assist with the school's 
educational programs. Parents help in classrooms,
 
chaperon on field trips, raise funds, supply educational materials, 
provide technical assistance, serve on committees, and take on various leadership roles.  Our PTA plans family nights: This 
past year we held family science, art and "Bracher Build" (STEM
) night.  Our parents also support Art in the classrooms 
and an extra curricular choir.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals
 
and actions to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to pro
viding a safe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills an
d attitudes including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the Scho
ol Site Council in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, 
and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development opportunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for S
tudent Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students 
by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practices, cognitive development and learning disabilities, an
d best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, and instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicat
ed to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 school 
year, and eight days of professional development in t
he 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while assessing student work.
