School Description
 
Holly Oak Elementary School is one of 18 schools in the Evergreen School District and opened in 
1967. The school prides itself on providing students a high quality education within the context of 
a caring and nurturing environment. We received the Californ

within a caring and nurturing environment. We hold high expectations for our students and provide 
them with the support they need to meet those expectations. High standards and a commitme

to respecting the dignity of others are evident on our playground, in our classrooms, and 
throughout our wider community.

About the SARC
 
By Febr
uary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fund
ing Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sc
hool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 
2010, and determined that each school within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their o
wn individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the California State 
Content 
Standards, with final approval by the Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted accordin
g to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about 
the quality, currency, and 
availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board
 
of Education adopted science programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting a
ligned to the new 
California Framework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state standards and a majority of the participants of any review process conduct
ed by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Holly Oak Elementary School, originally constructed in 1967, is currently 
comprised of 20 permanent classrooms, 12 portable classrooms, a library, a 
cafeteria/multipurpose room, a staff lounge, and two playgrounds.
 
 
Recent improvements include the modernization of seven portables, and the addition of five portables. The 12 porta
bles were placed in a new location 

, and the two playground 
areas were increased in size. An outdoor teaching amphitheater was adde
d to the campus. Security fencing was added, giving the ability to better monitor 
who comes and goes from the campus. The school also recently planted 25 trees around the campus. The chart displays the resul
ts of the most recent 
facilities inspection.
 
 
Cle
aning Process:
 
Holly Oak Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopt
ed cleaning standards for 
all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis thro
ughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and restrooms. 
A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

sanitation schedules that ensure
 
a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

vy maintenance functions 
occurring during vacation peri
ods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that school grounds and 
facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immediate attention. Emerg
ency repairs a
re given the 
highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to
 
assist school districts with expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. 
In the Budget Act of July 2009, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
adva
ntage of this flexibility. The district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are cl
ean, safe and in good repair.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Sma
rter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligibl
e students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

at the main office and wear a visitor

s pass at all times during their stay on school g
rounds. There is also a designated area for student drop
-
off and pick
-
up at the front of the school.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated in February, 2019 by the Emergency Response Team (ERT) and the Safe
ty Committee. It will 
be revi
ewed again this winter with a revision submission date of February 14, 2020. Any and all revisions to the plan are immediatel
y communicated to 
classified and certificated staff.
 
 
Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following:
 

 
PBIS (Positive Behavi
or Interventions & Supports)
 

 
School rules & procedures
 

 
Sexual harassment policy
 

 
Current status of school crime
 

 
Notification to teachers
 

 
Child abuse reporting procedures
 

 
School wide dress code
 

 
Policies related to suspension/expulsion
 

 
Disaster procedures/rou
tine & emergency drills
 

 
Safe ingress & egress of pupils, parents, & school employees
 
The school also created updated emergency procedures, evacuation routes, and new routines for monitoring students on campus.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the 
laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The school

s disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire, disaster, and lock
-
down drills are conducte
d on a rotating 
basis throughout the school year. Walking field trips to Holly Oak's three "Safe Areas" designated for evacuation purposes ar
e conducted each year by
