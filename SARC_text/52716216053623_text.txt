School Description
 
At Bidwell we are very proud of our school.
 
 
Bidwell Elementary is an extraordinary place filled with 
traditions and people who make a 
difference in the lives of every student.
 
 
Our staff and families 
work together to help students begin the path toward making dreams come true. We know 
education is the key that opens the door to opportunities. Our dedicated faculty and staff are 
committed
 
to providing our students with the best educational experience, and to do that we focus 
on the whole child. We all work together to provide a learning environment where students feel 
safe and their social/emotional needs are met.
 
 
 
 
 
Our faculty and staff
 
firmly believe that meaningful relationships with our students, families and 
our community are the foundation of our success. We provide a safe, and nurturing learning 
environment centered around our pillars of respectful, responsible, kind and safe citiz
enship. On 
the Bidwell campus, the school
-
wide expectations are evident in all we do. Students learn to use 
their "tools" to regulate emotions and build successful relationships which is embedded in our 
social emotional curriculum, "Toolbox." From our clas
srooms to our playgrounds to our common 
areas, respectful, responsible, kind, safe Bidwell citizens work daily to achieve their dreams.
 
 
 
At Bidwell Elementary, we are proud of our high level of student achievement. We focus on the 
21st Century teaching an
d learning standards of collaboration, communication, creativity and 
critical thinking in setting yearly goals for our students. Bidwell students are challenged daily to 
become thinkers for the future by actively engaging in their learning. Whether working
 
alone or 
collaborating together, Bidwell students apply their skills and knowledge in problem
-
solving 
activities that utilize and develop their reading, writing, critical thinking and technology skills while 
preparing them for the social and academic chal
lenges of the middle and high school years as well. 
Our instructional coaches and educational specialists play a pivotal role in making sure each child 
achieves his or her potential. The individual needs of our students with learning challenges are 
address
ed with teaching specialists in those respective areas. Students who are identified GATE are 
equally challenged with enriching and engaging curricular opportunities.
 
 
 
 
The faculty, staff and I look forward to working with you and your child. We know that 
our 
partnership is essential to our collective success and we value your input and involvement. We 
invite you to collaborate with us in helping your child reach his or her dream because we believe 
dreams are meant to become realities. As the principal of B
idwell Elementary, I am proud to serve 
you and your child and be a part of your child's educational journey.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents play a major role in the success of bo


ough our volunteer 
program. 
We know that parent involvement can take many forms and whether you can be here with us during school hours, participate in a
 
committee, prepare 
something for the classroom from your home or be with us at one of our many evening events, we appreci
ate your involvement. One of our many goals 
is to meet with 100% of parents at our Back to School Night event and our fall parent teacher conferences.
 
 
There are numerous parent involvement options including parent committees such as our School Site Coun
cil and English Learner Advisory Council, both 
which focus on our 
School Plan
 
for student achievement. Volunteers Investing in Bidwell Elementary School (VIBES) is another parent volunteer group 
that is open to all parents. VIBES organizes fundraisers whic
h are used to fund field trips, campus beautification projects, and school celebrations. In 
addition, our classroom parent volunteers are essential to our success. Our many family nights include our annual Fall Harves
t Carnival, Back to School 
Night, Famil
y game, art and science nights and student performances.
 
 
We welcome families to join us on Friday mornings for our weekly class 
presentations and PAW Print award ceremony that recognizes students that display the positive Bulldog Pillars of being Respec
tf
ul, Responsible, Safe 
and Kind students.
 
 
Our aim is to increase parental involvement at all levels and we look forward to your suggestions. We are happy to work with 
parents 
to find an area of involvement that will fit their needs and benefit our students
 
and school community.

General Operations: salaries, benefits, services, and materials
 

 
Special Education: programs offering 
appropriate, individualized instruction to students with special needs
 

 
Transportation

Each school receives an ins
tructional budget based on enrollment, programs, and formulas set by Board of Education policy, state law, agreements with 
bargaining units, and guidelines of outside funding sources. The School Site Council (SSC) meets approximately once a month t
o develo
p, implement,

ility Plan (LCAP). Parent 
representatives are elected to the School Site Council and serve two year terms. All parent

well as the District Advisory Committee (DAC) meetings, as a way to learn more about our school funding and academic goals.

he hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
