School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

19 School Year
 
Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Franklin Elementary is a small neighborhood school supported by a child
-
focused community. As represented in our school 
vision, children are at the h
eart of our efforts. The staff, district, parents, and community, work together to prepare 
students for the future, both academically and socially. A few carefully selected, high
-
quality programs help us focus our 
efforts and provide continuity throughout 
the school. We are fully implementing the Common Core Standards in 
Reading/Language and Math. Common Core is a set of standards developed by the federal government in the hopes of 
unifying education standards nationwide. Standards
-
based instruction in all 
areas is the focus at Franklin. Standards 
provide teachers with a common language and assist in providing a balanced curriculum for all students. School
-
wide goals 
are made in collaboration with staff and parents. The standards are based on analysis of stu
dent work, testing data, and 
collaboration. This focus reinforces our efforts in guiding creators, leaders and thinkers through their educational 
experience in Burlingame.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Our School Safety Plan is reviewed annually and copies are kept in the school office. The Big Five Drills are conducted 
monthly throughout the year with the support of the Central County Fire Department. The Safety Plan is reviewed by staff 
and School Site
 
Council throughout the year and was last updated in September 2019.
 
 
All classrooms are equipped with emergency supply backpacks, and there are emergency supplies on campus.  Our parent 
volunteers update classroom disaster supplies annually.
