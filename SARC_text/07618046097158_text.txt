Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Montevideo Elementary. It is our vision to 
build a community of learners who are eager 
and excited to learn, grow and think critically. We do our best to create a welcoming environment, 
where parents want to partner with us, to provide their students the very best education possible.
 
 
Here at Monte
video we firmly believe:
 

 
Every child deserves a free and top quality education.
 

 
ALL students can learn when learning is relevant.
 

 
The California State Standards provide equity, opportunity, and access to higher level 
thinking and a rigorous education fo
r all.
 

 
Social
-
Emotional development and rigorous academics are equally important in preparing 
our students for secondary school, college and the workforce.
 

 
Students flourish when education includes art, music, science and social science.
 

 
Parent particip
ation is key to student success.
 

 
Education leads to advancement and provides choices for all students.
 

 
I look forward to a productive and collaborative year with staff, parents and students.
 
 
Mission Statement
 
At Montevideo School we are 
committed to providing success for all students:
 

 
A safe and nurturing learning environment, with respect and encouragement for 
individual differences and opportunities to learn the skills necessary to become caring 
and responsible global citizens.
 

 
Academic
 
excellence in a rigorous standards
-
based curriculum, differentiated 
according to student need.
 

 
Success for each child, through collaboration between home and school.
 

 
Opportunities for each child to discover a love of learning based on their own 
intellectu
al, artistic, and athletic skills and interests.
 
 
School Profile
 
Montevideo is located in a cheerful suburban neighborhood of San Ramon where families and local 
businesses support their schools. Attached to the beautifully kept enclosed campus is a large 
s
prawling community park with a baseball diamond and grassy field used for soccer and other 
sporting practices and organized games. The location provides a perfect setting for the 673 
Montevideo Transitional Kindergarteners through fifth graders. Our campus
 
has 26 classrooms plus 
a few portables and another large portable building, which houses Kids' Country, our onsite after 
and before school care program. Montevideo also has a multipurpose room, library, science lab, 
computer lab and several smaller rooms 
used for small group instruction. 
 
 
 
At Montevideo Elementary School every child is provided this fantastic physical space for learning, 
but more importantly, they are also provided with a metaphorical canvas to explore their individual 
passions and intere
sts in a safe and nurturing environment. It is our goal to deliver rigorous 
curriculum, which allows for individual acceleration and encourages creativity and critical thinking. 
We believe strongly that every child will achieve success through great collab
oration amongst our 
teachers, staff, the principal, students and their families.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Ramon has developed and maintains our playing fields as a City park, and the
 
school district provides playground apparatus. The school and the 
community share this area. A new Kindergarten playground was constructed in 2003. In addition, the governing board approved r
eplacement of 2 HVAC 
units at Montevideo. Technology updates (e.
g., audio systems, document cameras and LCD projectors in all classrooms) are ongoing.

Parent participation is vital to our school. Parents are encouraged to work with us as partners in 
educating their children. As a result, our parents are 
extremely supportive with their time and resources. Our PTA coordinates over 10,000 hours of volunteer service annually, and 
each PTA activity has the 
overwhelming support of the Montevideo families an
d staff. From the Montevideo Back to School Night and School Carnival in the fall, to the Pizza Bingo 
and Movie Nights held several times a year, our PTA is committed to building a sense of community within the school. To that 
end, the PTA educates 
parents
 
on issues affecting their students and organizes enriching, supportive student programs. PTA fund
-
raising monies are used primarily to fund

School Safety Plan
 
Safety at Montevideo is a high priority. School Climate Survey data indicate that parents, students and staff vi

d community members 
working together for the good of students. We have numerous programs a
nd partnerships in place to help make our school even safer. A Comprehensive 
Emergency Plan, as part of the School Safety Plan, assure well

practiced strategies for dealing with emergencies. These plans are updated yearly, and 
safety measures are drilled r
egularly.  The 2019
-

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core 
State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offering
s. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Ma
th 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d p
rofessional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Le
arning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of
 
school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.

In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instr
uctional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of coho
rts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply 
align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our sta
ff the opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of l
earners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.
