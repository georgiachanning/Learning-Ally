By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

school with three teachers supported by one Title 1 Aide and a special education teacher.  All classrooms 
are combination classes and the student/teacher ratio is 12:1 allowing teachers to work with individual and small groups 
to great effect.  Our after 
school program, SPARKS, five days a week that focuses on cultural activities, homework and 
reading support.  Approximately 1/4 of our elementary students attend SPARK. The school has a large Native American 
population that live at the Grindstone Rancheria.
  
In addition, we have several interdistrict transfer students who come 
from other communities who like the small school setting Elk Creek Elenementary School offers.  The school is in a rural, 
low income area outside of Willows California in Glenn County 
and the goals for the school are to improve reading skills 
and writing skills, increase average daily attendance to 93% and contiue to reach out to our families and community for 
improved school support.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
June 2019
 
 
While textbooks and teaching materials used in the district are the most 
recent adoption or as recent as the previous 
cycle, the teachers make ever effort to teach beyond simply allowing textbooks and worksheets to drive instruction. 
Educational resources like Teachertube.com, EBSCO Host and many other materials are used. In ad
dition, all teacher at 
Elk Creek Elementary School (ECE) continue to grow their professional skills through inservices, trainings and conferences 
and continuous reflection about their teaching practice.  ECE recently added 20 Chromebooks for students and i
s also 
integrating and testing STEM activities in two classrooms.  A lead elementary teacher attended the Next Generation 
Science Standards (NGSS) Symposium in preparation for an increase of science instruction in the elementary classrooms. 
A science text 
has not been adopted, and further training of teachers is a goal as trainings become available in the area.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are 
encouraged to volunteer and participate in their students' education, and students whose parents are involved 
have a greater rate of success.  Parents are encouraged to be part of the School Site Council, attend School Board meetings, 
act as classroom volu
nteers and when appropriate, be part of the Grindstone Parents Meeting organization as well as 
attend field trips, award ceremonies, teacher student/parent meetings and participate in the development of the LCAP. 
To improve teacher
-
parent communication the
 
district adopted minimum days in the fall and spring that allow teachers 
to meet with parents to discuss student progress.  In addition, we appreciate the effort parents put forth to get their 
students to school regularly, on time, and ready to learn. We 
acknowledge that this takes consistent work by involved 
parents and they are encouraged to contact the teachers and administration about how we can mutually support one 
another's efforts to do our best to ensure the success of all students.  The teachers o
f Elk Creek Elementary participate in 
School Site Council meetings, but parent attendance is inadequate despite efforts to attract parents to the meetings 
through a posted agenda, text notification prior to meetings, and planning the meeting time to be con
venient for parents.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priorit

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Stony Creek Joint Unified School District Safety Plan contains sections specific to each site in the district, including 
Elk 
Creek Elementary School. The Safety Plan is reviewed and updated annually and approved by the Board of Trustees in 
March.  All 
staff are updated on changes to the School Safety Plan at the beginning of the school year in August. Regular 
fire drills are held, as well as earthquake and intruder
-
on
-
campus drills, and records are maintained to document all drills. 
The District notific
ation system allows for the capability to respond to an emergency in a rapid, effective manner through 
e
-
mail/voice call and text. Through Catapult system, we are able to summon fire and/or law enforcement immediately, 
including local first responders who 
have been trained on the system alongside school personnel. The emergency 
notification system is sophisticated and has many features, including the ability to determine the location of teachers and 
students through GPS and an "all call" feature that allows
 
the school to notify and update parents in the event of a school 
emergency.
