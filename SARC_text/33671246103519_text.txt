School Description
 
Sunnymeadows Elementary School is located in
 
the western portion of Moreno Valley. 
Sunnymeadows serves Transitional Kindergarten through fifth grade students on a current 
"modified traditional" school schedule. Our teaching staff is dedicated to meeting the needs of all 
students. Teachers are fully 
credentialed and highly qualified. We are an AVID (Advancement Via 
Individual Determination) school.  This means that the students will be taught strategic strategies 
of organization, inquiry, collaboration and organization.  AVID is a college readiness sy
stem for our 
elementary students that is designed to increase school
-
wide learning and performance. The AVID 
College Readiness System (ACRS) accelerates student learning, uses research based methods of 
effective instruction, provides meaningful and motivat
ional professional learning, and acts as a 
catalyst for systemic reform and change. We are a PBIS School and our goal is to provide a positive 
environment where the entire Sunnymeadows community feels empowered to do their personal 
best and where our schoo
l spirit creates an atmosphere of pride and well being.
 
 
Our student population is very diverse. Approximately 59% of our students are identified as English 
learners (EL) and over 80% of our students qualify for the Free and Reduced Lunch Program.
 
 
Our mis
sion at Sunnymeadows Elementary School is to provide all students with a first class 
education through an environment where students of all cultures are provided the opportunity to 
achieve their maximum potential. This is accomplished by providing a clean,
 
safe, and supportive 
campus; by teaching students in a positive and fair manner; and by all staff encouraging each 
student's academic, personal, and social growth towards becoming productive, responsible 
citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in
 
California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educati
onal agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, 
data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.
ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
communit
y members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the

At Sunnymeadows Elementary School, we are committed to meeting the academic needs of all of our students. A critical part of 
helping our students is 
the school
-
to
-
home connection. We strive to help parents help their children 
at home in a variety of ways. We provide home connections often, maintain 
a Sunnymeadows website and encourage parents to attend parent conferences and school
-
wide events.
 
 
Parents, as members of the Sunnymeadows Parent

Teacher Association (PTA), enrich th
e quality of our school climate. PTA supports and promotes Spirit 
Days, Red Ribbon Week, assemblies, field trips, rewards,schoolwide incentives and Family Nights.  They are also several PTA m

the school year.
 
 
Our School Site Council 
(SSC), comprised of elected staff members and parent representatives, works collaboratively with the entire Sunnymeadows staf
f

e Su

all SSC meetings.

dents who are English 
learners. The ELAC meets at least five times yearly, 
and agendas are posted in the school office.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Cl
imate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety is the top priority here at Sunnymeadows.  The collabo
rative effort to develop and implement a comprehension site safety plan is paramount to 
student safety.  Sunnymeadows' site safety plan includes important procedures that maximize safety.  Integrated into the site
 
safety plan is Positive 
Behavior and Suppo
rts (PBIS).  This initiative fosters structured lessons that support positive student interactions that reflect respect, resp
onsibility, and 
safety.  In addition, our site safety plan incorporates emergency evacuation maps and procedures in case of an emer
gency.  Some of the various 
emergency procedures that are covered in the plan include fire emergencies, lockdown emergencies, earthquake emergencies, and
 
many others.  We 
maintain a high level of safety at Sunnymeadows and we regularly meet with our site s
afety team to stay current and updated on new procedures.  We 
hold fire drills once a month to practice our procedures and ensure that the students, staff, and all stakeholders know the p
rocedures.  Sunnymeadows 
follows the existing laws related to school 
safety.
 
 
The School Safety Plan also includes the MVUSD discipline policy, which describes the consequences for student misconduct (su
ch as detention, Saturday 
School, suspension, and expulsion).
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and disc
ussed with the school faculty on December 11, 2019.  In addition to reviewing the school 
safety plan, Sunnymeadows has a committee that meets regularly throughout the school year to discuss discipline and safety is
sues.  A copy of our site 
safety plan is u
ploaded on our school's website as well.
