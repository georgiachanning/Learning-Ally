A Message from the Principal:
 
Sun Empire is known for its positive and supportive environment. Visitors to our campus remark on good student 
behavior and the welcoming attitude among staff. There is a lot of parent support and invol
vement. The rural setting 
includes many mature trees, and there are usually seasonal flowers in the flowerbeds. There is obvious pride in the 
school.
 
 
We are known for steady improvement in student achievement and an emphasis on good character. The motto for 
Student of the Month represents our values: Academics, Attendance, and Character. Sun Empire has won awards for 
character education and has successf
ully completed two years of Positive Behaviors Supports and Interventions 
program , which supports students' success and academic achievement. Intermediate students are expected to 
provide service to their school through student council, peer mediation, th
e referee team, or the community service 
team. Our super readers club has received the Golden Bell award for outstanding programs.
 
 
Because of the supportive environment and focus on students, staff remains at Sun Empire for many years. Students 
benefit fr
om their expertise and commitment.
 
 
 
Major Achievements:
 
Sun Empire earned a bronze and silver medal in Fresno County's Positive Behavior and Intervention Support.
 
 
Sun Empire earned the Title 1 Academic Achievement Award.
 
 
Sun Empire received a grant from
 
Central Valley Foundation to support programs that foster student literacy. The 
grant pays for an English Language Development summer school to help build literacy skills in ELD students.
 
 
Sun Empire earned the Educational Results Partnership Honor Roll H
igh Performance School Recognition for 2018
-
19.
 
 
Students have benefited from our focus on academic and personal excellence.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The Sun Empire School Site Council, composed of parents and staff, meets quarterly to discuss student ach
ievement 
and determine how federal and state funding should be used to support student learning. Several personnel and 
programs are supported by these funds. Trained bilingual tutors support English learners in the classroom and work 
with students in small
 
groups and one
-
on
-
one to improve reading skills. The Academic Coaches for Literacy and Math 
support student achievement, particularly in learning English and meeting content standards. In addition, the 
academic coach trains teachers in effective reading i
nstruction and works directly with students in reading 
development. She also supervises bilingual tutors and trains them on a regular basis.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. 
Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e
.g., test data, enrollment, high 
school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 
SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), whi
ch describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more informat
ion about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Sun Empire sets a high priority upon ensuring that the
re are sufficient textbooks and materials to support the school educational program. Textbook 
selection is done by the District, grade level, and subject area committees coordinated by District curriculum and instructio
n administrator. All texts must 
be ad
opted from the most recent approved State matrices or local governing board approved lists. Textbook purchases are consistent
 
with the content 
cycles of the California Curriculum Frameworks as District IMF and other funding sources permit.
 
 
Categorical fun
ding also allows us to purchase supplementary instructional materials for English Learners in kindergarten through sixth grad
e to 
accelerate pupils as rapidly as possible towards grade level proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking. These materials a
r
e used in addition to the basic 
Reading/Language Arts and other core materials provided for every student are correlated to State Standards
-
aligned textbooks each year with new 
adoption cycles per core area. Supplementary Common Core Standards Plus was pur
chased for grades 3
-
6 during the 2019
-
2020 school year.  
Supplementary Science Next Generation Science Standards STEMscopes online curriculum was purchased for grades K
-
6 during the 2019
-

year.

Professional development has become part of the daily work life of the 
Kerman Unified Professional Learning Communities. Teachers, 
administrators and support staff participate in workshops and seminars, 
coach one another, plan lessons together, and collabo
rate for the purpose 
of student achievement. The professional learning community 
understands that teachers need collaboration time with one another.  As 
a result, there is much support for providing the time and resources 
teachers require for the purpose o
f changing their practice. Teachers are 
afforded opportunities to participate in curriculum development, learn 
and share successful methods of reaching students, discuss 
comprehensive and efficient ways to implement standards, and continue 
their own learni
ng. The district and school provides professional 
development days for staff.  These days are devoted to curriculum training, 
discussing achievement data, and grade level collaboration.  Staff also has 
the opportunity to attend out of district conferences 
to enhance their skills 
as educators.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 
3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are needed and encouraged to be active in education at Sun 
Empire! Organized opportunities for parental involvement include School Site 
Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and Parent Faculty Club (PFC). Sun Empire also sends parent represe
ntatives to district 
committees such as the District E
nglish Learners Advisory and Local Control and Accountability Funding Planning. Many parents volunteer on a regular 
basis in classrooms and the library. Parents are eager participants on field trips or for special class activities.
 
 
The PFC supports the sc
hool program through meetings, community events, and Red Ribbon Week activities. It also organizes book fairs during parent 
conferences. The PFC relies on parent participation for school fund
-
raisers, which support study trips and special purchases, such a
s the school marquee. 
Several grade levels offer parent information and/or training as needed, such as kindergarten orientation and Kinder Camp to 
incoming kindergarten 
students. To enhance parent involvement, the school purchased a wireless translation sy
stem to facilitate meetings and presentations.
 
 
Most parents attend Back
-
to
-
School Night and parent conferences. In addition, many parents attend quarterly awards ceremonies and monthly Student 
of the Month ceremonies. An annual parent survey conducted by 
the district and school site receives over 55 percent returns and indicates high parent 
satisfaction with Sun Empire, its policies, and its programs. Survey results are available from the principal. To find out ho
w you can volunteer, please 
contact the pri
ncipal.

School Safety Plan
 
School safety is a p
riority for Sun Empire. Safety policies and procedures are updated and detailed in the annual Student Parent Handbook, which 
we 
provide to all families in both English and Spanish at the beginning of the school year. Staff and the School Site Council (S
SC)
 
review the school safety 
plan on an ongoing basis. The SSC reviewed and updated the plan and established a safety goal on September 2019. The district
 
also provided a safety 
district meeting with law enforcement in 2013 at which all Sun Empire staff atten
ded and collaborated to implement/update a on
-
campus lock down 
safety plan.  Lock
-
down procedures are practiced quarterly within our school site.
 
 
The plan includes procedures for emergencies and exit routes. We share the plan with all staff during school
-
wide staff meetings, along with other safety 
issues such as child abuse, blood
-
borne pathogens, internet safety, and sexual harassment. We practice fire drills monthly, earthquake drills four times 
a year, and practice lock downs, in case of intruders, fou
r times per year. In addition, safety is emphasized through teaching students responsible 
behavior. Social skills groups are available for students who have difficulty building good relationships.
 
 
Staff monitors the school grounds before school as well as
 
at all recesses and at lunchtime. For children who must arrive early, supervision is provided in 
the cafeteria beginning at 7:30 a.m. Teachers regularly review school rules for safe, responsible behavior in school and on t
he playground. We have a 
closed c
ampus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the main door and sign in at the office, where they receiv
e a badge to wear 
throughout their stay.
