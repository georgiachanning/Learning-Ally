W
elcome to Chavez Elementary School! Our teachers hold high 
standards for student achievement 
and behavior and provide students opportunities to excel in many disciplines. As a staff, we are 
committed to providing each child with a quality educational and social experience. In addition to 
our strong focus on academ
ic achievement, we strive to encourage our students to become 
successful in the classroom and throughout our Madera community.
 
 
Cesar Chavez Elementary is located southeast of the city of Madera and has an enrollment of 
approximately 750 students in presch
ool through sixth grade. The Madera Community College is 
located within a mile from our school, and agricultural land surrounds our site. Chavez is located in 
a rural neighborhood of parents and community members who take pride in their school.
 
 
Staff at C
havez work together to meet the needs of every student. Every grade level meets in 
Professional Learning Communities in order to discuss current student data and to make decisions 
about best practices. These meetings are scheduled weekly on Tuesdays and Th
ursdays during the 
staff development portion of our minimum day.  Many teams of teachers utilize additional time 
after the school day to work together to plan and provide students with quality instruction.
 
 
Students deploy among their own grade level to re
ceive scaffolded yet rigorous reading instruction 
in grade 4
-
6. Students in grades K
-
3 receive guided reading instruction to meet their individual and 
specific needs.  Students with intensive needs meet in small groups with the RtI Reading Specialist. 
All 
groups are adjusted as students progress. COST and Student Study Team (SST) meetings with 
teachers and parents are held as needed in order to discuss student needs and progress. These 
meetings include discussions in regards to all strategies/interventions 
provided for our students 
and the necessary next steps needed to meet their needs. Our special
-
needs students receive 
support in general education classrooms by highly qualified Special Ed Teachers and 
Paraprofessionals.
 
 
Parents at Chavez are actively inv
olved in the education of their children. This is demonstrated by 
their personal involvement, participation and support of our school. Our parents are invited to 
monthly Friday morning Coffee Hours/Horas de Caf√© with our Principal. This is an opportunity t
o 

our English Learner students through the inclusion of ELAC (the English Language Advisory 
Committee).
 
 
Occasionally, we invite community partners who may prov
ide additional services and resources for 
our families and parents. We enjoy providing information and news with our community.
 
 
Chavez parents believe in high standards for their children and the school. They support a balanced 
instructional program that 
places an emphasis on building academic excellence and personal 
responsibility. We recognize and value the support and involvement of each and every parent!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

r science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use i
n the classroom 
and to take home Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departmen
t of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by t
he state are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are a
vailable for parent 
examination at the district office prior to adoption
.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the S
tate priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education populat
ion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
alig
ned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that 
satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Cesar Chavez Elementary is committed to improving the performance of all students and to 
closing the achievement gap. We take advantage of our early 
release staff development days to meet in Professional Learning Communities for data collection/reflection and to plan for in
struction. In addition to 
these days, there are times when the staff me
ets after school to do further trainings.
 
 

vide intervention strategies, 
direct instruction  techniques and English learner strateg
ies. Through the use of our Teachers on Special Assignment (TSA), we have also provided our 
own staff professional development in Kagan Structures, academic vocabulary strategies and other reading strategies for first
 
through sixth grade 
teachers. This yea
r, all students will receive differentiated reading instruction at their grade level through a school
-
wide deployment called WIN (What I 
Need) Time. Our Primary Literacy Support Specialists provide coaching support in the primary grades to improve teachers

training for guided reading instruction and ongoing informal assessments. Our site coach provides coaching cycles which inclu
de modeling, co
-
planning, 
co
-
teaching, observing, supporting, and reflecting for all grade level
s based on needs of staff. Teacher teams are led in the development of rigorous, 
common core aligned units of instruction. Students are thus engaged in integrated curricular learning experiences throughout 
the day.
 
 
The majority of our staff has been 
trained in conducting Professional Learning Community meetings. These collaborative meetings are focused on current 
student data collected by our common formative assessments. Teachers meet in PLCs during our minimum days(Thursdays) and ever
y other Tuesday
. 
Teachers at each grade level share out best practices based on the results of their assessments.
 
 
Administration continues to participate in daily Focus Walks throughout our campus. Notes are taken based on observations mad
e during the classroom 
visits. 
Teachers are provided with immediate written and oral feedback in regards to rigorous instructional techniques.
 
 
Topics for staff development include: Professional Learning Communities, Guided and Close Reading, Informal Running Records, 
Khan Academy, Path
 
to 
Proficiency (for ELs), Write From the Beginning, Thinking Maps,  Response to Intervention, NGSS Science Lessons, Reading, Sch
olastic Reading Assessment
