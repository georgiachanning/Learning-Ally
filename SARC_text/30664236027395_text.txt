By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
http
s://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page
 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest 
is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Mission Statement
 
The mission of Paul Revere Elementary School is to provide a high
-
quality education to a diverse population of children 
with focus on the mastery of skills that will enable them t
o live productively and competitively in a global society as 
responsible, confident, and enthusiastic lifelong learners.
 
 
School Profile
 
Paul Revere Elementary School follows a single
-
track calendar and serves students in grades TK
-
6. Originally built in 1
960 
with a massive modernization and reconstruction project completed in January of 2006, Paul Revere is a school
-
wide 
Title I school that also provides State Pre
-
School classes on traditional schedules for 3
-
 
and 4
-
year old children. This 
school year, enr
ollment is approximately 806 students in grades TK
-
6th in General and Special Education classes. 
 
 
Approximately 91% of our students are Hispanic/Latino, 55% are identified as English learners, and 80% of our students 
participate in the free/reduced lunch 
program.
 
 
Instructional Program
 
The belief that all children can learn and develop into confident readers and critical thinkers is emphasized by qualified 
staff who provide all students a rigorous and challenging instructional program. Our staff embraces a
 
collaborative team 
approach in ensuring that all students have access to the core curriculum through the use of effective instructional 
strategies, classroom practices that build on community, timely progress monitoring, and detailed analysis of student 
m
astery of the standards
-
based curriculum. Maintaining a positive, scholarly school culture is a focus at Paul Revere 
School.
 
 
Response to Intervention
 
Students in the General Education setting who are struggling academically are provided with 
systematic intervention 
strategies to support their identified academic needs. This year, two Teachers on Special Assignment are contracted to 
support students in grades K
-
6 who require the additional assistance in reading. Children are selected for partic
ipation 
based on an on
-
going diagnostic assessment of essential skills by their classroom teacher. Both Teachers on Special 
Assignment coordinate with the classroom teachers to ensure targeted skills are explicitly taught in the program. 
Children are monit
ored and re
-
assessed bi
-
monthly, monthly, or quarterly depending on their level and moved in and 
out of the intervention program throughout the year based on their progress. Additionally, Paul Revere school maintains 
an active School Study Team that meets 
monthly to discuss the needs of at
-
risk students having difficulty in areas of 
academics, behavior, health, attendance, and family issues. A team of specialists also work together with staff and 
families to provide specific interventions for students ident
ified with learning disabilities. Maintaining a positive, 
scholarly school culture is a focus at Paul Revere School.

Average Percentage of 8 categories evaluated: 98.42% Overall rating: GOOD
 
 
General: The District takes great effort to ensure 
that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the 
District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. Safety 
inspections take place on a quarterly basis at all 
sites. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school 
and efforts made to ensure that students are provided with a clean, safe, and functioning learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that repair
s necessary to keep the school maintained and in 
working order are completed in a timely manner. An electronic work order process is used to ensure timely and efficient 
service. Emergency repairs have highest priority. A maintenance worker is assigned to t
he site, and is usually on campus 
once every week. No emergency repair needs exist at this site.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule: The District has standard cleaning procedures and guidelines used at each school site. 
Cleaning schedules are developed jointly
 
between the principal and custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school. Since 

months all schools are being deep cleaned on a rotation 
schedule.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
incl
udes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. 
Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilitie
s); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are important partners in our instructional program and we provide a variety of opportunities for parent 
involvement at Paul Revere School. Two committees that are program
-
related and very active in the community are the 
School Site Council/English
 
Learner Advisory Committee and PTA. These elected positions allow parents to learn specific 
information that promotes informed input regarding the school's daily programs. Parents are also encouraged to 
volunteer during the school day in and out of classr
ooms and to participate in leading special activities/events or serving 
in district programs such as the Parent Leadership Institute. During the year, we offer numerous opportunities for parent 
education through monthly Cafecitos (coffee chats) with the Pr
incipal and counselor, focused academic workshops on 
topics such as parenting, technology, financial literacy, stress management, nutrition, and Physical Education to support 
our distinguishing practice of Health and Fitness. Also offered are Cuentos Famil
iares, Ten Commandments of Education, 
technology
-
focused workshops, parent learning walks, and numerous opportunities to volunteer through Girl Scouts and 
monthly Food Pantries, 
 
which are two special programs sponsored by United Way through a partnership 
grant. A 
community liaison is available to recruit, assist, and engage parents in all school programs or to connect them with 
necessary services and resources.
