Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

2020 year, 72% of the days noted are partial days and 28% are full days. All training and curriculum 
development activities at Pepper Drive School support the implementation of quality instructional practices in order to 
access the curricular 
content with an emphasis on the California Standards in English Language Arts, Mathematics, and 
Science (Next Generation Science Standards) as guided by curricular frameworks. At Pepper Drive, certificated staff have 
27 hours of professional learning time 
scheduled on site. These are considered partial days. Staff and administration define 
the use of these hours which are utilized for team meetings, whole staff professional learning, and interest

They attend professional conferences focused on increasing professional skills. They also have access to a group of 
teachers on special assignment that work as Curriculum Resource Teachers.  Using thes

certificated staff may complete a personalized learning plan each year and receive compensation for profess
ional learning 
outside contracted hours. Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are performed by staff 
representatives, site administration, district administrators, using tools such as teacher input, district benchmark results,
 
dat
a analysis, and focus groups to determine the areas in which additional teacher training may enhance classroom 
instruction and increase student achievement levels. Pepper Drive School offers support to new and veteran teachers 
through peer coaching and men
toring. All staff are encouraged to actively grow professionally as lifelong learners.
