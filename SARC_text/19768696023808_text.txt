Principal's Message
 
 
As principal of Juan de Anza Elementary School, I am extremely proud of the high quality education 
program offered to our students. Our staff is committed to providing a very challenging curriculum 
within a highly nurturing environment. Our school brings t
ogether students from many 
backgrounds and cultures. Our diversity is the foundation of our core belief that every child can 
learn and be successful at Anza School. Our state
-
of
-
the
-
art school building exemplifies our 

safe and quality learning experience for all of our 
students. We are proud to be recognized as a California Distinguished School. Being a student at 
Juan de Anza means becoming part of a special community where teachers, staff, and parents are 
dedicated to
 
improving student achievement and nurturing responsible citizens.
 
 
There are a variety of reasons why Juan de Anza School is unique and successful. Our staff is 
committed to providing a very challenging curriculum within a highly nurturing environment. We
 
are all committed to preparing our students to take their place within an ever
-
changing global 
society by providing them with a content
-
engaging curriculum which stresses thinking and 
developing meaning. Knowing that our students need requisite skills to 
take their place in the 
information age, we have designed a curriculum that encourages our students to think creatively, 
to strengthen their communication skills, to problem solve, and to work together in a variety of 
collaborative structures, applying and
 
connecting their learning with real
-
life situations.
 
 
At Anza we believe in the whole child. In addition to strong high academic standards
-
based 
curriculum, we have various programs that meet the needs of our students. We use a multi tier 
system of suppor
t (MTSS) to help ensure student success. Some of the programs include Project 
Lead the Way (PLTW), Gifted and Talented Education(GATE). Teachers and students work hard both 
in and out of the classrooms to ensure future success. We believe our students shou
ld be creative 
thinkers who are able to use available resources and technology to solve any problems which they 
encounter. Teachers are guiding our students as they use their iPads and/or Chromebooks to 
enhance their learning. In addition to a strong, high
ly academic, and standards
-
based curriculum, 
we have various programs that meet the needs of students. Some of the programs include Project 
Lead the Way (PLTW) and Gifted and Talented Education (GATE). In addition to these programs we 
provide music classes
 
that are available to students. We are proud to be recognized as an Honor 
Roll School by the Educational Results Partnership (ERP) in 2017, 2018, and in 2019. We are also 
very proud to be recognized both as a California Distinguished School, and a Platinu
m PBIS School. 
Being a student at Juan de Anza means becoming part of a special community where teachers, staff, 
and parents are dedicated to improving student achievement and nurturing responsible citizens.
 
 
The Anza staff believes that all students can l
earn and use student data as both a performance 
indicator and as a guide to for instructional decision making. The staff utilizes a rigorous TK 

 
5 
curriculum, instructional materials, and instructional practices that are aligned to the California 
State St
andards. Teachers provide students with challenging lessons and multiple opportunities to 
think critically and demonstrate their learning in a variety of ways. At staff meetings and grade level 
meetings, teachers review local and state assessments to deter
mine the effectiveness of our 
instructional program and to identify areas of strength and areas for improvement. We use a multi
-
tier system of support (MTSS) to help ensure student success.

Multiple measures are used to identify students needing intervention. Anza uses dat
a, accessed through multiple measures such as 
PowerSchool, Schoolzilla, Literably, Lexia, and Accelerated Reader for measuring student progress. This allows for developmen
t of 
appropriate instruction and school wide academic interventions and enrichment op
portunities such as English Language Arts (ELA) and 
Math Interventions. The emergent California State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are the new foundation 
for 
rigorous and non
-
repetitive curriculum and instruction. The impact of analy
zing data is demonstrated by the growth in State testing 
outcomes between 2015 and 2019. Overall, students "meeting" or "exceeding" the standards, as measured by CAASPP, show an incr
ease 
in both Mathematics and English Language Arts.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Efforts the school district make
s to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

We have many ways for parents to participate in life at Juan de Anza School, and we depend on parents to k
eep our programs running smoothly. Parents 
can join our School Site Council, which works with administrators, teachers, and classified staff to help make financial and 
educational decisions. Parents 
of English Learners are vital to our English Language Adv
isory Committee and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families. Room parents organize 
parent volunteers to help with special projects in the classroom and chaperone field trips. Our PTA provides invaluable suppo
rt for our school through 
fund
-
raising
 
and thousands of hours of volunteer work. The PTA also coordinates special family events such as restaurant nights and specia
l parent 
information sessions. We encourage parents to come and get to know the Anza community through events such as the Pizza Pi
cnic, Costume Parade, 
Winter Wonderland, and Spring Art Show. The Wiseburn Education Foundation provides funding for programs that enrich our arts 
and music 
opportunities. We ask all parents to attend Back
-
to
-
School Night in the fall, Open House in the spr
ing, and parent
-
teacher conferences in the fall and 
spring. Our PTA has been very successful in reaching out to new parents to help build our volunteer base.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Prio

School Safety Plan
 
The Anza community of teachers, parents, students, and staff are all committed to providing a positive and safe environment. 
Our award winning positive 
behavior support system SOAR was developed  to encourage the positive character traits of honesty, respe
ct, accountability, objectivity, kindness, and 
outstanding citizenship. Anza Eagles are scholars, outstanding citizens, accountable, and above all respectful (S.O.A.R.). SO
AR slips are used to recognize 
students that have exemplified expectations.  In addi
tion, school wide challenges like the Kindness Challenge and Character Challenge are opportunities 
that allow students to demonstrate their compassionate side. Teachers and instructional aides supervise the playgrounds. Our 
students are taught to 
resolve c
onflicts in a calm and non
-
physical manner using strategies that promote positive behavior. Fighting and/or physical altercations are extremely 
rare at Anza and result in serious and immediate consequences. Students benefit from a clean, safe facility that
 
reinforces the high value placed on 
education by the school community.
 
 
The safety of students is the top priority at Anza. In order to ensure safety for all we have a district wide emergency proto
col manual that is reviewed 
annually by all the teachers, 
staff members, and the school site council. It contains procedures for fire, earthquake, lockdown, and shelter in place. In 
addition to being reviewed, these scenarios are practiced as a school monthly to refine our actions and advocate for further 
safety.
 
In the 2014
-
15 school 

k in collaboration with 
this and other emergency agencies to ensure our plans and procedures are up to date 
and effective.  Each staff member is assigned to various committees 
that will ensure safety during an actual emergency (search and rescues, first aide, communication, etc.). Anza participates a
nnually in the Great California 
Shakeout each October. This pro
vides us the opportunity to stage a full
-
scale earthquake drill with all committees engaged.

During the 2018

2019 school year, our teachers attended 3 days of staff development that tied into our overall professional development plan 
for the 
implementation of cognitively guided instruction in the area of math. 
Through our continued partnership with the Talking Teaching Network, the focus 
was Mathematics.  Each Wednesday, students are released by 2:05 p.m. for grade
-
level and site
-
level planning activities. When planning staff training, 
teachers and administrator
s look at student test scores and review the most pressing issues of the previous year to choose specific topics to focus on 
and refine instruction. Teachers were provided an additional hour once per month, for Teacher Collaboration Time (TCT). TCT's
 
were 
lead by the 
administrator and teachers. Anza teachers are increasingly integrating technology to enhance instruction. Through a combinati
on of professional 
development, coaching and collaboration, Anza analyzed student CAASPP data for students in grades 3
-
5 and collaboratively determined instructional 
needs of students.
 
 
In addition to our work in math, Anza teachers attended 3 full days of professional development on the The New Generation Sci
ence Standards (NGSS). 
Professional development was led by UCLA'
s Center X. By the end of 2018
-
2019,100% of Anza teachers received professional development in CGI math 
and the NGSS.  Work will continue throughout the 2019
-
2020 school year.
