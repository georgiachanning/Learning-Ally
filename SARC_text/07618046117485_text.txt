School Description
 
Coyote Creek is a California Distinguished School that opened in 
August 2000. It was the first 
developer built school in the Dougherty Valley of San Ramon. The school serves the neighboring 
population of the Gale Ranch Division and is surrounded by beautiful rolling hills and a few 
remaining ranches. Continued developme
nt is expected in the area and Coyote Creek has seen 
many changes. The school opened with a student population of 300 and currently has 825 students 
enrolled.
 
 
The cornerstone of our school is the strong partnership between students, staff, parents, and th
e 

There is a fervent desire to provide a learning environment that is conducive to developing the 
unique intellectual, social, physical and emotional potentia
l of each child. We believe that all 
children can learn and are responsive to their unique learning styles. Our strong academic 
curriculum is standards
-
based and our teaching strategies provide a positive, caring and stimulating 
setting where students love
 
to learn. Parents place an exceptionally high value on education and 

program.
 
 
The PTA has been successful in furthering the community spirit by sponsoring fa
mily events that 
include a Welcome Back Social, Multicultural Day, family game nights, and school dances. PTA also 
coordinates parent volunteers in many leadership roles that include committee chairs, room 
parents, and Art Masterpiece. Our Coyote Creek Lea
rning Foundation enhances school programs 
through fund raising efforts such as our annual registration drive, Spring auction, Fun Run, and 
Spell
-
a
-
Thon. With financial support, volunteer time, committee leadership, and professional 
services, parent involve
ment is essential to running an efficient and unique school. With a keen 
eye, our Site Council reviews data and programs, and then makes recommendations for program 
improvements.
 
 
Our student leadership group, Peacemaker program, and safety patrol groups o
ffer leadership roles 
for students and teach community awareness and safety. Character education is addressed through 
Sanford Harmony, the district adopted curriculum.
 
 
With Common Core Standards and school goals in mind, teachers work collaboratively to f
urther 
develop their curriculum within and across grade levels. As active participants in the school, all staff 
members are considered educators of children and accept this responsibility with pride. Within the 
school there exists mutual support, respect, 
shared decision making and leadership. Coyote Creek 
is a school of excellence as evidenced through our commitment to creating a community of learners 
and leaders who will succeed long after they have left our school. Along with a rigorous academic 
program,
 
Coyote Creek offers theatre, music, visual art, dance, and media arts experiences to all 
students both as independent classes and as interdisciplinary subjects woven into core content 
areas of English Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies. Stud
ents enrolled in our school 
receive weekly instruction in visual and performing arts (VAPA) and integrated arts. Specifically, 
students in grades 4 and 5 receive two
-
50 minutes of Performing Arts instruction per week. Our 
students in the primary grades of 
TK
-
3 receive arts instruction in periodic cycles. Additionally, 
students receive integrated arts instruction from our classroom teachers, spearheaded by our 
teachers seeking certification through the Integrated Learning Specialist Program (ILSP). Our 
progr
am enriches the lives of its students while preparing and equipping them to meet the 
academic challenges ahead.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to p
ublish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prep
are a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consist
ent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information
 
about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

Coyote Creek Elementary greatly benefits from supportive parents who are an integral part of the school community. The school
 
has a strong base of 
parent vol
unteers who volunteer in the classroom, tutor students, supervise at lunch, and chaperone field trips. Parents are also welco
me to attend PTA, 
School Site Council, and Coyote Creek Learning Fund meetings. The main focus of the PTA is to sponsor family fun 
activities to help build community and 
to strengthen the school
-
home partnership. Our Learning Foundation is responsible for fundraising; thus providing the school with personnel and 
programs to maintain and enhance the quality of education and environment
 
of Coyote Creek School. Site Council is a governing board responsible for 
monitoring the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement and the School Improvement Program budget. The school also benefits from several community 
partnerships: including the San Ramon V
alley Education Foundation. The San Ramon Rotary honors a staff member and student each year and provides 
dictionaries to all of our third graders.

day of school students are given a guided tour of the school facility and introduced to key 
staff members and are reminded about school etiquette and safety. Each classroom has an emergency pack and disaster plan to f

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional 
development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategie
s. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along w
ith targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and t
he Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the de
velopment and implementation of the CCSS and professional learning 
offerings.
 
These learning experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Comm
on Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessio
ns. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to pa
rticipate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These cohorts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Proble
m Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our s
ummer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff deve
lopment days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.

Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators
, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member
 
helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhan
ced.
