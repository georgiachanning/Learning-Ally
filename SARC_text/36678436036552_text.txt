By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
As the principal of McKinley School, I am pleased to present
 
this Student Accountability Report Card (SARC) that 
demonstrates our commitment to a quality education for all of our students.
 
 
The staff, PTA, School Site Council, parent volunteers, and I direct all of our energies and resources to developing an 
educat
ional environment where children will grow socially, emotionally, and academically. Our goal is to provide a well
-
rounded education for each student so that he/she may reach his/her fullest potential and become a successful, 
participating member of society
.
 
 
School Summary
 
McKinley Elementary School is one of sixteen (16) elementary schools in the Redlands Unified School District. It is located 
on the southeast corner of Olive Avenue and Center Street in the central part of Redlands. McKinley has a current 
enrollment of approximately 425 students in grades Transitions Kinder through fifth. Originally, an eight
-
classroom, multi
-
story, brick school opened on the current site in April, 1904. The school was named in honor of President William McKinley 
who visite
d Redlands in 1903. The present school was constructed in the same location and has been in continuous 
operation since 1938. A new wing of classrooms was added in 1956 and portable classrooms in 1997. The school has 
recently undergone a complete modernizat
ion of all of its buildings.
 
 
McKinley School is dedicated to providing each student an opportunity to share in an educational environment conducive 
to creating a sense of pride, exploring his/her uniqueness and developing his/her capabilities to the fulle
st extent.
 
 
In addition, McKinley has prescribed to the Character Counts! program and its six pillars of being trustworthy, responsible, 
respectful, fair, caring and demonstrating good citizenship. Through the Characters Count! program, we recognize studen
t 
achievement through a positive rewards program utilizing "Bear Paw Awards" and "Book Paw Awards." Students are 
randomly chosen on a weekly basis as well as at the end
-
of
-
the
-
trimester awards assemblies (or monthly flag pole 
ceremonies) from the entries c
ollected through the "Bear Paw/Book Paw" system, and attend either "Lunch with the 
Principal" or "Books with the Principal" to celebrate their accomplishments. Both rewards programs have proven to be 
very successful elements that foster student achievement
 
here at McKinley Elementary. In 2017
-
2018, McKinley 
participated in Year 1 of the Positive Behavior and Intervention Support (PBIS) training program. Over the course of the 
school year, the staff worked diligently on establishing universal school wide exp
ectations and building off the Character 
Counts! to ensure all students had a clear understanding of our character education program. McKinley is currently in year 
3 of the implementation process for PBIS.
 
 
School interventions have included: an Early Read
ing/Literacy Intervention for primary grade level students, the 
Accelerated Reader Program, Lexia (Reading), DreamBox (Math), before/after intervention for all at
-
risk/struggling 
students, and Redlands High School tutors. Enrollment in our intervention pro
grams depends on the needs of our students, 
and prescribed accordingly based on the needs.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school maintenance team has the primary responsibility for keeping the campus and the classrooms in a clean and 
orderly manner. Rooms are cleaned on a regular basis in the evening or prior to the start of the school d
ay in order not to 
interrupt the education of the students. McKinley School is given a complete cleaning during the summer months. The 
district maintenance department assumes responsibility for completing improvement projects. All rooms are in excellent 
co
ndition.
 
 
The school's risk management team has the responsibility for checking all areas
 
of the campus to make sure that conditions 
are safe for students and staff. Representatives from the fire department and health department inspect the school on a 
regular basis. Any discrepancies are addressed as quickly as possible by the school.
 
 
A scho
ol disaster preparedness plan is in place and is updated on an annual basis.

Maintenance and Repairs
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at 
the school office, at the Distri
ct Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. When maintenance and repairs are needed, the site 
custodians are notified and work or repair is mad
e if possible. If site custodians are not able to do the repairs, the District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed 
in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure
 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning process and schedule
 
School site custodians clean each classroom daily and the school district provides a grounds crew who work at McKinley 
on a rotating basis.
 
 
Our di
strict's service center can easily track work requests to address repairs more efficiently through a work order system.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The PTA plans and organizes many activities to enhance the learning opportunities for all of our students. Any 
correspondence for the PTA officers may be left with any school office staff mem
ber. Our ELAC/SSC parent groups help 
revise our school plan and offer input on how funding should be utilized for student interventions/programs.
 
As a means to improve school safety, we developed a new safety committee to help us glean parent input on impr
oving 
safety around our campus. All parent groups are well
-
supported by our community.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
McKinley School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to evaluate the 
current status of school crime. A Safe School Plan is adopted in March of each school year and is reflective of the school's 
safety ne
eds. The key components of McKinley's Safe School Plan include a description of school discipline policies and 
procedures, dress code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting 
procedures, dangerous pup
il notification, and disaster response procedures. The services of a Redlands Police Department 
School Resource Officer is available to provide counseling, education, and law enforcement support for students.
 
 
To ensure student safety before school, teache
rs, ancillary staff and administrators supervise the school grounds including 
the cafeteria and playground. During the school day, all entrance areas to the school are locked. All visitors must enter 
the school office and gain clearance before entering cam
pus. McKinley school uses the Raptor system to screen visitors 
before entering campus.  In addition, we have five (5) Campus Monitors that supervise the cafeteria and playgrounds 
during lunches and recesses. Additionally, a crossing guard ensures students 
cross the street safely before and after school. 
Finally, although supervision is limited after school, the administrator/designee supervises the campus at dismissal until 
all students have left the campus for home. Safety has been a central focus over the
 
past few years, and our new safety 
committee helps guide and propose new suggestions for ensuring improved safety on campus.

Summary of Strengths
 
McKinley School is fortunate to have a highly dedicated and professional staff. Teachers are committed to the idea that 
all students can learn irrespective of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, or socio
-
economic background. In order to address the 
educational n
eeds of an ever
-
changing, diverse student population, the staff at McKinley follows a state and district 
adopted curriculum, which will nurture the intellectual, physical, emotional, and moral attributes of each child.
 
 
There is a strong focus on literacy 
at McKinley School. The Accelerated Reader Program is used in Grades 1 through 5 to 
provide students with appropriate reading practice. The Accelerated Reader Program allows us to identify the reading 
level of our library books and identify the independent
 
reading level of our students. Students then select books at their 
level for independent reading, and when they have completed the book, they take a computerized comprehension test. 
Students receive points and incentives for their accomplishments.In addit
ion, McKinley has prescribed to using the Lexia 
Reading program to help all students improve their reading skills.
 
 
In order to assist those students who are not at grade level in reading, we offer a number of interventions including: Small 
Literacy Groups
, and Lexia. We have one (1) categorically
-
 
funded intervention support teacher who provides reading 
instruction to our students reading below grade level. These staff members have received specialized training and utilize 
specific reading programs that ha
ve proven to be highly effective.  These classes are kept very small and have no more 
than 6 students per teacher. Students are assigned to the classes based on their specific needs in reading.
 
 
Parent involvement and support is another strength at McKinle
y. Parents are active as classroom volunteers and are 
members of the School Site Council and Parent/Teacher Association.
 
 
Technology continues to be a focus at McKinley School. The use of computers in the classrooms provides students the 
opportunity to rec
eive computer
-
assisted instruction throughout the curriculum. All students have access to the internet 
from the classroom. A computer lab and the library and may be used to access the internet for research projects. All 
classrooms are set up with laptops f
or the teacher along with LCD projectors which can be used to project video streaming 
clips or other integrated technology. Over the past couple of years, McKinley has utilized elements of Google Classroom 
to help boost the integration of technology in the
 
classroom.
 
 
Critical Needs
 
We are working diligently to update our library. We continue to replace many old books with new titles. The library check
-
out/check
-
in is now computerized. We have identified all of our titles that have Accelerated Reader tests,
 
have color
-
coded the reading level, and have purchased tests for them. In order to support our strong literacy program at McKinley, 
it is important that we continue this process of adding new titles and expanding our Accelerated Reader collection. It is 
a
lso important that we add additional hours to our library staffing.
 
 
Our library is open to students during the school day, so that they may exchange their books, take Accelerated Reader 
tests, and have a quiet place to read.

Technology continues to be a 
focus at McKinley School. The use of computers in the classrooms provides students the 
opportunity to receive computer
-
assisted instruction throughout the curriculum. All students have access to the World 
Wide Web from the classroom, computer lab and libra
ry and may use the Internet for research projects. All classrooms 
are set up with laptops for the teacher along with LCD projectors which can be used to project videostreaming clips or 
other integrated technology.
 
 
Students will improve their reading abili
ty through a variety of teaching strategies and programs such as the Journeys 
curriculum, Accelerated Reader, and Lexia
 
 
Students will increase the amount of time and number of books that they are reading independently.
 
 
Three Year Student Objectives
 
State
 
and district assessments and classroom work will demonstrate continual improvement in basic learning skills for all 
students and especially students designated as below "proficient" on the Smarter Balanced Assessment and grade level 
common assessments. Th
e McKinley staff will continue to work as a Professional Learning Community (PLC), and analyze 
common assessment data by grade level as well as data from IABs/ICAs to help guide their instruction. Additionally, 
interventions will continue to focus on our i
ntensive reading programs for both at
-
risk students and English language 
learners. Annually, the McKinley staff will analyze student growth and evaluate the effectiveness of our programs, and 
make adjustments where appropriate. Attendance will be closely m
onitored to reduce tardy and absence rates by keeping 
parents informed of their child's attendance, reward students with good attendance, and hold parent/teacher/principal 
conferences, and utilize the School Attendance Review Team (SART) and School Attenda
nce Review Board (SARB) 
processes for students with exceptionally poor attendance.
