By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Linking community traditions to our continuously evolving educational goals of providing universal access is the core of 

or the first time 
in August 2007.  Reagan School was built, thanks to help of its caring community, through Measure R funds and money 
from the state.  Reagan Elementary is a charter school, within the Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District.  Through 
this living document, the charter, the school has been able to adopt creative methods of education, using researched 
based best practices, while maintaining the traditional high standards expected by the Kingsburg Community.  Ronald W. 
Reagan is a family o
f 675 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students and 65 staff members committed to assisting our students in 
excelling.
 
 
With the unique grade configuration of the schools in our district, there is a common thread that unites the students as 
they transition into and
 
out of the schools throughout the years.  Together, they develop strong friendships where 
tolerance is accepted and diversity is welcomed.  The staff takes pride in knowing generations of families.  Reagan has 
developed a strong partnership with the commu
nity it serves, where high expectations for academic standards, 
citizenship, community service, recreation, and traditional values are embraced and enveloped in the framework of a 
caring community.
 
 
The Reagan staff is a highly qualified and enthusiastic g
roup of professionals who are dedicated to bringing out the best 
qualities in our students, ourselves, and in the work that we do together.  We are truly an organization that respects 
learning, honors teaching, and teaches for understanding.  The staff col
laborates in many ways, with a focus on the 
academic success of every  student embedded into every aspect of planning, organization, and use of resources, materials, 
fiscal and personnel.  The maintenance staff is an important part of the learning communit
y taking pride in keeping this 
new school a place where students and staff are honored to attend.  In addition to maintaining beautiful grounds and 
facilities, it is not uncommon to find this staff assisting students, playing tetherball, decorating Christm
as trees, and 

the community.  Reagan is proud to be a member of the Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District.  Our mission is 
simple
, "We will find a way for ALL students to learn."

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Reagan Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers.  Safety of students 
and staff is a primary concern of Reagan School.
 
 
The school is always in 
compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state 
earthquake standards.  At the beginning of the year, the District Safety Committee meets to review safety issues.  Key 
elements of the safety plan include identify
ing the level of threat, protective options, staff initial action/response, incident 
coordinator, and incident management team.  There is also a strong focus on drug awareness and maintaining a drug free 
school, as well as emphasis on evacuation plans.  Fi
re, earthquake/severe weather, and lockdown drills are implemented 
multiple times each year.  The most recent School Safety Plan was amended and reviewed by our SSC (consisting of parents 
and staff members) on November 12, 2019.
 
 
Students are supervised th
roughout the day by the teachers, paraprofessionals, support staff, learning director, and the 
principal.  There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up, in front of the school.  Visitors must check in and 
register at the office and receive a
 

School District encourages volunteers in the classroom, field trips, fundraising efforts, and with special projects.  All sch
ool 
volunteers in direct contact with stud
ents are required to complete a district application form, provide evidence of a clear 

police department through an automated record c
heck.  Volunteers working more than 10 days per month will need to 
fill out additional forms and submit to fingerprinting.
 
 
PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports) is in its fourth year of implementation at Reagan Elementary.  PBIS is 
a way for
 
staff to support students who have violated school or educational code rules and assist them in learning from 
their digressions.  The goal is to create a positive atmosphere at Reagan where all students are aware of behavioral 
expectations in different lo
cales, such as in the classroom, library, in the office, in the cafeteria, etc.  Reagan has adopted 
the acronym HONOR (Hard work, On task, Never give up, Outstanding Respect) as a means to monitor all students' 
behavior.  All staff members at Reagan Elemen
tary know what HONOR stands for and hold students accountable to it.  We 
have a school counselor and aide that are on campus every day to run our behavior academies for students who are falling 
short in any of the HONOR areas as well as checking in with ou
r at risk students.
 
 
The Stop, Walk, Talk Bullying Prevention Program has been introduced to the staff and students at Reagan Elementary.  
At the beginning of the year, students and staff alike sign an anti
-
bullying contract, which states, "We will not 
bully others."  
In each classroom, the anti
-
bullying message is posted where students and staff are able to see and refer to it.  The 
program utilizes classroom meetings, open communication, and follow up as means to improve culture at the school site.  
Mr
s. Marriott visits each classroom four times a year to teach the curriculum to students.  Mrs. Marriott also runs a peer 
support group throughout the year that goes into more depth about the bullying program and how students can be 
advocates for their peer
s on the playground. If a classroom is struggling with any of these areas Mrs. Marriott goes and 
does individualized lessons with the class.
