Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

adults. Our motto at DPE is to, "Treat others the way you want to be treated" and every day together we strive for students 
to learn their A.B.C's:
 
 
A.

C.

Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Dos Palos Elementary is one of the oldest facilities in our school district. Considering this, our maintenance and custodial 
staff keep the campus safe and clean for our students and our 
staff. Classrooms are in adequate condition and there are 
enough classrooms to accommodate all of our students. In August of 2019, our site was visited by the Williams team and 
a Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) was completed and provided to our district. Re
sults included minor issues in our restrooms 
such as a loose faucet. The FIT also revealed minor issues with a couple of classrooms, which have been recently fixed. 
During the Summer of 2019 work on grounds were completed and classrooms painted. During Win
ter Break the Cafeteria 
floor was replaced. We will also continue to make various improvements to the interior and exterior facilities. Any hazards 
found are immediately attended to.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

opportunities.  Parents can also communicate with their t
eachers through email, scheduled meetings, or phone. In 
addition, our Aeries communication system provides an outlet for parents to text teachers directly. Teachers and the 
school also use the Aeries communication to send home Dialers, emails,  and text me
ssages to communicate and remind 
families about upcoming events, schedule changes, or other pertinent information. Dos Palos Elementary also has an 
active Facebook page to communicate positive news and events that occur in and out of the classroom. Parents
 
can direct 
message the Principal through this outlet. Our recently established Parent Club is another great way for parents to be 
involved in their child's academic experience. All parents are welcome and encouraged to join at any point through out 
the sc
hool year.  Any parent who has questions about the above information or is interested in volunteering is encouraged 
to come in or contact the office. Dos Palos Elementary staff is committed to providing the best opportunity for student 
success. We understa
nd that it is vital that parents play an intricate role in this process. If parents have ideas and thoughts 
on how we can make our school a better program for our students we encourage them to share their ideas.
