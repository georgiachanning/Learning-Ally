By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Thomas R. Pollicita (TRP) provides a safe and secure environment in which excellence in academic, social, ethical and 
physical development is the standard for all students. The staff of TRP believes
 
that 1) Students need to be respected as 
leaders in order to succeed academically; 2) Students and teachers should come to school to learn and teach; 3) Students 
should have every opportunity to achieve their highest academic potential; 4) All teachers sh
ould hold high expectations 
for students to achieve their highest personal potential; 5) Increased support for second language learners is aggressively 
pursued; and 6) Culture and anti
-
bias perspectives are studied and included in weekly school
-
wide charac
ter building 
lessons.
 
 
Located on the east side of Daly City against the backdrop of San Bruno Mountain, TRP serves 651 sixth, seventh and 
eighth grade students of diverse backgrounds. Student ethnic breakdown is: 46.1% Latino, 33.3% Filipino, 1.4% African
 
American, 11.8% Asian, 3.4% White, 1.4% Pacific Islander, and 2.6% of Multiple Races.
 
 
All of TRP's teachers meet the Federal guidelines set forth by No Child Left Behind and are fully credentialed.  All but two 
teachers are teaching in their credentialed
 
area. TRP's staff have worked to address the academic needs of our Latino, 
English Learner, and African American students. To do this, teachers have engaged in the Results Oriented Cycle of Inquiry 
(ROCI); a process of on
-
going formative assessment, data 
analysis, and re
-
engagement which takes place during weekly 
grade level and department meetings.
 
 
The SARC is available on the district website at www.jsd.k12.ca.us and can be made available in hard copy upon request.
 
 
Please contact the school at 650

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
There are 31 classrooms, a library, a multi
-
use room that serves as the cafeteria during lunch, and an athletic facility that 
includes a gym with 700 occupancy capacity and an artific
ial turf field. The school is situated on a tract of land it shares 
with Susan B. Anthony, bordered by E. Market, Orange and Chester Streets. Susan B. Anthony serves students from 
kindergarten through fifth grade. Eighth grade students move onto high schoo
l where a majority of students attend 
Jefferson High School and Westmoor High School.
 
 
School cleanliness standards that are high at T.R. Pollicita. We have one full
-
time day custodian who maintains and inspects 
the buildings daily and a full
-
time 
night custodian. Each custodian is responsible for specific areas of the school and rooms 
to keep clean. When maintenance issues arise a work order is submitted to the district maintenance department using an 
online work order system, significantly speedin
g up the resolution of open work orders. The fall of 2015 saw the 
completion of 19 new classrooms. Phase two of the project began in the summer of 2015 with the demolition of twenty 
classrooms, the library, the multi
-
use room and the locker rooms. A new ad
ministrative office, library, multi
-
use room, 
locker rooms, a pull in, pull out driveway along East Market Street, and the modernization of the twelve remaining 
classrooms and student restrooms were completed in the fall of 2017.
 
 
Data reported are the det
ermination of good repair as documented in a completed Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT) 
conducted every year. The most recent inspection was conducted in August 2018. Additional information about the 
condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by 
speaking with the school principal.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

T.R. Pollicita encourages family engagement and involvement in their child's education and has an active Parent Teacher 
Student Organization (PTSO). The PTSO holds monthly meetings and puts on a variety of different events. Monthly coffees 
or teas with the
 
principal are held to enable families to give feedback to the principal, provide input on different initiatives, 
and to get to know different staff members and families. To keep families informed of our academic program, weekly 
emails are sent to the TRP 
community. Additionally, the school sends regular reminders via automated emails and phone 
calls. TRP has three full time counselors who help coordinate counseling services and provide referrals to Star Vista. 
Parent
-
teacher conferences were held once duri
ng the year after school to give families the opportunity to meet with 
their English Language Arts teachers and receive benchmark test results and progress in their classrooms. Finally, family 
and community members sit on our School Site Council and Englis
h Learner Advisory Council, which meet quarterly.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
T.R. 
Pollicita expects and maintains a high priority on student safety and learning by holding monthly safety drills (Fire, 
Earthquake, Hold and Secure, Lockdown), rewarding students for demonstrating good behavior and offering 
consequences for students that do
 
not meet classroom and school
-
wide expectations. Positive Behavior and Intervention 
Supports (PBIS) are implemented at Pollicita and staff recognize students daily with SPARK (Safe, Positive, Academice, 
Responsible, Kind) points through the PBIS Rewards A
pp. T.R. Pollicita's administrators focus on maintaining a safe and 
orderly environment for students and staff through the use of assemblies that explicitly inform students of expectations, 
the support of campus supervisors who carry out administrative dir
ectives for orderly behavior in common areas and 
classrooms, and counseling sessions (group or individual) when students have a difficult time adhering to expectations. 
Our belief is that if students are concerned for their safety or are experiencing a cri
sis, they will not be able to focus and 
do their best. Likewise, staff members aren't able to teach effectively if they are concerned for the safety of the students 
in their classrooms. Taking a proactive approach to building tolerance, preventing bullying
 
and ensuring a safe and stable 
learning environment, weekly character building activities are taught in our advisory classes which address issues such as 
Respect and Responsibility, Respecting Other Cultures, and Setting and Achieving Goals. In addition, 
our Peer 
Mediation/Restorative Justice students are trained to facilitate conflicts between students.  Administrators notify parents 
and families when issues of safety and inappropriate behavior arise.

have been trained in Constructing Meaning engagement strategies to facilitate their 
students' participation in structured 
academic discussions and improve their academic writing. The English Language Development (ELD) Team has ensured 
that our English Learners have access to a 30 minute ELD block. To improve Mathematics instruction TRP te

focusing on two of the four Standards for Mathematical Practice: 1) Improving students ability to make sense of problems 
and persevere in solving them and 2) Constructing viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others.
