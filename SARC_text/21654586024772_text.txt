About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state
 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are require
d to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to b
e 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teachers and administrators from all subject areas
 
form working committees to draft recommendations 
on courses of study, appropriate textbooks, and other instructional materials.
 
 
The California Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the sta
t
e schedule for these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are aligned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Adv
isory Council, composed of administrators, teachers, and parents representing each school in the district, 
reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions for all courses of study, appropriate textbooks, and other materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Council recommendations are forwarded to the Board of Education for final approval. Thi
s is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and suppleme
nted.
 
 
This table shows some of the textbooks used with grade K

site supervision is provided for programs 
that take place before and after school. Before school, two supe
rvisors watch students out on the yard. Middle school teachers are assigned to watch 
the locker area every morning and also in the afternoon. Staff members are also assigned to help supervise and organize after

Venetia Valley School was established in 1959. The school has a total of 39 classrooms, a library, computer lab, music room, 
gymnasium, stage, locker 
rooms and tw
o playgrounds. The school underwent modernization in 2004
-
2005 and 2005
-
2006 using voter
-
approved school bond funds and state 
modernization funds. The modernization project included the addition of a new middle school campus at the back of the propert
y wit
h three new 
classroom buildings for new middle school students, a new modular student restroom building, modernization of the K
-
5 campus including 
library/computer lab and gymnasium, extensive repaving and site work, and conversion and expansion of the old
 
kindergarten building into a new student 
services area. Two classroom portables were added in the summer of 2013 to address growth.
 
 
The district strives to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classrooms, and offices ar
e cleaned daily. Students are 
encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. An online maintenance o
rder request process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.

SRCS' b

and to provide 
instructional technology to support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs and equipment are being built
 
and improved to reduce 
overcrowding in our schools and to better meet the growing demand for hands

Parent involvement is a vital component of the educational program at Venetia Valley School. The San Rafael City Schools woul
d not be what it
 
is today 
without the contributions of countless parents and guardians who give their time and expertise as volunteers and who share th
eir financial resources to 
support the goals and aspirations of San Rafael schools.
 
 
Parents and guardians have the oppor

Task Force, district and school English language advisory committees, parent teacher associations, district and school site c
ommittees, fun
draising 
campaigns and special events.
 
 
At Venetia Valley School, specific opportunities for parent participation include the site leadership team, parent teacher as
sociation, school English 
language advisory council monthly Charla Café International Story
 
Night, Madre con Poder and I CAN Moms, and many subcommittees that address 
specific program needs. Recent activities that involve parents include an Ice Cream Social, a Fall Carnival, International Po
t Luck, Family Game Nights and 
an International Story N
ight.
 
 
Parents are also connected to the school through various informational and community
-
building events, including back
-
to
-
school nights, teacher 
conferences, concerts, plays, musicals, and other artistic and athletic events.
