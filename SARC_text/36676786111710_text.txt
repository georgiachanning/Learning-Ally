About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

History/Social Science programs for districts to consider for their new adoption. CVUSD elected to continue to use current Di
strict adopted materials 
while further studying program options provided on the SBE list 
to consider for a future piloting process. CVUSD reviewed current District adopted 
materials and determined that they meet current history/social science standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Chino Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) makes it a priority to maintain safe, clean, and effective school sites for our 
students, staff, and parents. The 
safety of students is of p
aramount importance to CVUSD. In the morning, staff supervision is provided to watch the cafeteria, entrance gates, and 
playground activities. During lunch and recess times, noon ground supervisors and teachers monitor students to ensure student
s interact 
safely. At the 
end of the school day, staff supervises student dismissal. The staff and student workspaces for this site are cleaned on a re
gular basis by the school site 
custodial staff. In addition to regular cleanings, deep cleanings are scheduled and c
arried out during breaks and vacation periods. The school facility is 
adequate and has sufficient classrooms, playgrounds, and staff spaces in order to operate efficiently. A planned or recently 
completed school 
improvement for this site is a full school m
odernization project currently in progress and a schoolwide security camera and keyless access system 
currently in progress.

To ensure sites are clean, safe and functional, Maintenance and Operations department staff conduct inspections at the school
 
site
s on a continual basis. 
School sites may also enter maintenance requests by accessing the School Dude system. After the school site request is entere
d into the system, a work 
order is generated, and the Maintenance staff works diligently to complete all wo
rk orders in a timely manner.  The Maintenance team utilized the Facility 
Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction (OPSC), 
to record inspection results.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Country Springs Elementary is fortunate to have a very active parent community. Parents have the opportunity to provide input
 
and participate in many 
aspects of the school. Every parent is a member of the Parent Facul
ty Association (PFA). Through the PFA board, committees, and as volunteers, parents 
are a constant, welcome, presence on the campus. PFA members spend countless hours assisting in classrooms, attending field t
rips, planning and 
supporting fundraisers, and 
providing assemblies 
-
 
all to benefit the students. The School Site Council and English Learner Advisory Committee have a 
full complement of parents and meet monthly to discuss the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA), budget, and other important iss
ues to enhance 
the learning environment and educational program for the children. School/business partnerships, such as our association with
 
various restaurants, 
provide an important link with the community and benefit the school and students as well as th
e business.
 
 
Country Springs utilizes the school website, weekly principal e
-
mail newsletters, Aeries, Remind, and other technologies to link families and school 
together.

School Safety Plan
 
Each school has a detailed School Site Safety Plan for emergencies that is annually reviewed, updated, and discussed by the S
chool Site Council. The date 
on which the School Site Safety Plan was last annually reviewed was March 2019, and the plans are revi
ewed monthly by the School Site Council.  Each 

onents and procedures. 
Fire, earthquake, and intruder drills are held on a regular b
asis so that all students and staff are familiar with emergency procedures. Emergency supplies 
are located on each campus in the event of an emergency.
 
 
Assigned staff monitors school grounds daily before, during, and after school.  The District policy reg
arding campus visitors is enforced by requiring 

-
in log is located in the school office and all visitors must sign in before 
going onto the campus. In addition, all visit
ors must wear an identifying badge while on campus. To increase security, all gates remain locked during the 
school day, so visitors must enter campus through the school office.
 
 
The Chino Valley Unified School District is committed to providing an environ
ment that fosters health and safety, in both form and function. This 
commitment extends to the process of developing and maintaining a comprehensive Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan as a
 

Safe Schools Plan and is evident from 
the individual site to the overall District. These plans delineate actions to protect all students while they are at 
school. The plans are designed with the help of security staff members, local law enforcement, local fire, and emergency mana
gement, and pu
blic health 
officials as required by Education Code 32280
-
32282.
 
 
Plans are reviewed and updated yearly in accordance with Education Code 32286. These plans include procedures to respond to c
ritical incidents, such 
as fire, earthquake, or intruders. School
 
personnel practice these drills regularly.
 
 
The primary purpose of the Chino Valley Unified School District Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan is to define roles a
nd responsibilities at the 
site and between the site and district office management. T
he Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Plan establishes the minimum requirements for 
school and site plans throughout the District. This Plan meets the requirements of the Standardized Emergency Management Syst
em (SEMS) as mandated 
by California Code of Re
gulations, Sections 2400
-
2450, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as mandated by Government Code 8607. 
It also meets the requirements for earthquake preparedness found in Title 5 (California State Education Code, Sections 35295
-
35297).
