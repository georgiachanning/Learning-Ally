By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The mission statement for Elmer Wood School is "Every Child is a Masterpiece in the Making" and is the foundation upon 
which our school vision has been established. The ultimate purpose of education is to help each student develop a
cademic 
skills and accept the responsibilities and obligations of good citizenship which lead to successful participation in 
tomorrow's world.  Our programs meet the diverse needs of all students, generate a sense of belonging, and nurture our 
youngsters a
s they each find their path through childhood.  This mission statement not only aligns with the era of the 
Common Core State Standards by highlighting both the necessary academic and social
-
behavioral skills needed for 
students to be college and career rea
dy, but also incorporates the sense of kinship at Elmer Wood that extends to all 
students, teachers, classified staff, parents, administration, and community.
 
 
The campus serves students in transitional kindergarten to grade six with a total enrollment of 
567 students. Our student 
population mirrors our surrounding community and consists of a majority of students of Hispanic descent (69.84%) with 
other races represented in smaller percentages. Our students have persevered to succeed despite facing many chal
lenges 
such as: coming from homes impacted by poverty (75.62% low socio
-
economic status), being charged with not only 
mastering the English Language, but also mastering the California State Standards concurrently (22% English Language 
Learners), and/or ach
ieving mastery while at the same time overcoming or coping with a disability (13.93% students with 
disabilities, although nearly 2% of that total is students being served strictly for speech articulation concerns and do not 
necessarily have any academic or
 
social
-
behavioral impact).
 
 
The tone of the student body is one of caring and respect.  A positive school climate is fostered through the use of Positive
 
Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), and is guided by the belief that "Elmer Wood Woodchucks a
re a family of 

Woodchucks are expected to be: Respectful of self, others and surroundings, Responsible and prepared to learn and Ready 
to foll
ow directions and procedures.  Daily, weekly, monthly, trimesterly and yearly reinforcements are consistently 
utilized in order to reinforce student behaviors that are explicitly taught through our school wide behavioral matrix. All 
students have an opport
unity to receive recognition throughout the school year in a variety of ways.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent and 
community involvement is a essential component to student success at Elmer Wood School.  Various school 
related parent and community involvement events are conducted throughout the year to include an annual family reading 
night related to the school book f
air, a family movie night, spelling bee, talent show, student test chats and other parent 
informational meetings such as "Donuts for Dad" and "Muffins for Mom" as a means to build a bridge between school and 
home.  Parent
-
Teacher conferences are held in th
e fall and spring, however parents and/or teachers may request a 
conference at any time.  Back to School night is held early in the school year to inform parents of the classroom and school 
routines and expectations, as well as ways to become more involved
 
in their student's education.  Open House is held 
every May to showcase school programs and student progress.  Phone calls and emails are responded to within 24 hours.
 
 
The Atwater Elementary School District funds one four hour school community liaison (C
ommunity Outreach Coordinator) 
to assist with parent and community outreach, as well as to monitor and support various student groups. Elmer Wood 
funds an additional two hours for this liaison to help support foster students and student groups that may be 
at

has also provided each school with an additional one hour for an instructional assistant to make connections with foster 
stu
dents on campus.
 
 
Finally, our school plan is created by our School Site Council, which is composed of 50% staff and 50% parent members. 
Meeting times are posted in the school building and our entire community is encouraged to attend. Our English Language 
Advisory Committee also works closely with our School Site Council and provides input into our school plan with a special 
focus on our English Learner population. Parent volunteers are welcomed to assist in classrooms and at various special 
events througho
ut the school year.  Our school has an active parent club, which organizes fundraisers, the school book 
fair, and assists in school
-
wide events.  Parents contact either their child's teacher, or the school office staff, when inquiring 
about parental involv
ement.

Teachers participate in grade level collaboration trainings each year.  They are also released by substitute teachers to 
receive additional training during the school year.   After school and summer optional 
trainings are also offered.  During 
the last three school years, teachers have been provided on
-

teachers this year focus on English Language Learners and Math Number Talks.
 
 
The district has three instructional coaches to help 
all teachers with ELA and Math assessments.   School sites participate 
in site specific professional development, based on their data, during weekly Professional Learning Communities (PLC) 
meetings.  All schools participate in grade level academic conferen

progress, data, and future instruction, based upon the data gathered.  In addition, new teachers to the district receive 
another layer of support with the Induction Program.  This includes two days of trai
