School Description
 
Sugar Hill Elementary is a transitional kindergarten through fifth grade school located in the 
planned community of Sunnymead Ranch. The school is located in the northern section of Moreno 
Valley. We have a current enrollment of approximately 580 students.
 
Since we opened our doors 
to welcome students in September 1987, we have been regarded as the "neighborhood" school.  

 
 
Sugar Hill Elementary School is comprised of a diverse population of students. The dominant 
la
nguage is English. Other languages spoken include Spanish, Tagalog, Chinese, and Arabic. The 
varied ethnic composition is shown in demographic information.
 
 
Our professional staff works to ensure that every child receives a quality education. State Content
 
Standards are used to provide a strong base for our inquiry based learning instructional program. 
Our grade level teams meet weekly to collaborate and effectively plan instruction. Student progress 
is regularly monitored and strategic interventions are ad
ministered in order to support students 
and increase achievement. Achievement is measured through a variety of measures including 
Common Formative Assessments, Interim Assessments, District MAP, ELPAC and CAASPP 
assessments.
 
 
Our school receives both Title
 
I 
-
 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged and 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) funds. Supplementary resources from our School 
Improvement Programs and proactive Parent Teacher Association (PTA) additionally provide 
instructional mate
rials, assemblies, educational field trips, and staff development, which assist 
teachers in maximizing the potential of each of our students.
 
 
Mission
 
The mission of Sugar Hill Elementary School is to enable our students to access and take ownership 
of the
ir learning through practices that are inquiry based, rigorous, and equitable.  We strive to 
build a culture that supports the social, emotional, and academic needs of all members of our 
learning community and allows our students to achieve their highest p
otential.
 
 
Vision
 
The vision of Sugar Hill Elementary School is to empower our students to become compassionate, 
empathetic, and global
-
 
minded citizens who, as lifelong learners and problem solvers, create a 
better and more peaceful world.
 
 
In addition to
 
our academic program, our school prides itself as a Positive Behavior Intervention 
Support (PBIS) site. We are committed to creating a positive school climate and culture in which 
our students can thrive both academically and socially. Sugar Hill teaches 
positive social skills 
through our Character Education program and maintains daily attendance and decrease suspension 
rates. Sugar Hill Dragons strive daily to live up to the tenets of our school's expectations:

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards,
 
which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

s calculated by taking the total number 
of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment p
lus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is 
ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score o
r not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Student achievement and success is based upon strong school and community partnerships. Sugar Hill Elementary not only encour
ages parental and 
community involvement, but also provides a wide variety of activities that
 
allow for this. Business and civic organizations support our academic programs 
and student recognition activities.
 
 
Parents enrich and enhance our instructional program through participation in the School Site Council (SSC), English Language
 
Advisory Comm
ittee 
(ELAC), Local Control and Accountability Plan Committee (LCAP), African American Parent Advisory Committee (AAPAC), Parent Te
acher Association (PTA) 
and classroom volunteers. At Sugar Hill, these groups support and promote teacher and class support, 
Family Education Nights, Red Ribbon Week, Science 
Fair, Spelling Bee, College Kick

School Safety Plan
 
The comprehensive School Safet
y Plan includes, but is not necessarily limited to, assessing the current status of school crime committed on school 
campuses and at school related functions, identifying appropriate strategies and programs that will provide or maintain a hig
h level of sch
ool safety, and 
addressing procedures for complying with existing laws related to school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are held at least twice a year at the secondary schools and once a month at the elementary schools. Earthquake, d
isaster drills and campus 
lockdowns are conducted as needed. The School Safety Plan also includes the MVUSD discipline policy, which describes the cons
equences for student 
misconduct (such as detention, Saturday School, suspension, and expulsion).
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last r
eviewed, updated, and discussed with school staff on March 11, 2019
