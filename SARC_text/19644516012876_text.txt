About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. Classrooms, bathrooms, and general areas a
re in good repair and 
receive basic cleaning on a daily basis. Detailed clea
ning is done during vacation periods. The District provides maintenance services on a regular schedule 
or when an emergency occurs.
 
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive a
nd conduct inspections at 
school sites on a continual basis. The District administers a scheduled maintenance program to ensure a suitable learning env
ironment. At the time this 
report was published, all restrooms on campus were in good working order. Dail
y reports of incidents that require repair at the school sites are processed 
through work orders. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The remaining incidents are handled on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis to ensure 
efficient service.
 
 
The Di
strict participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typi
cally this includes roofing, plumbing, 

rred maintenance plan is available 
at the district office.
 
 
To determine the condition of ou
r facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection using a survey called the Facilitie
s 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.
 
 

 
you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of 
the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool loc
ated on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQ
uest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at 
public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Interne
t at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include t
he hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
, and the ability to print 
documents.
