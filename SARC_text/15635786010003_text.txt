By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Richland Junior High provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff and volunteers. The school is situated on 13 
acres. School facilities were built in 1934, with additions built in 1999. They span more than 55,900
 
square feet and include 
a cafeteria, library, and classrooms. Fourteen classrooms and two sets of restrooms were modernized in 2007
-
2008 with 
some modifications to main school offices.  The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ampl
e 
classroom and playground space and a staff resource room.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The District has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A summary of these standards is available at the
 
school office or at the District office
. The site administration team works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. A team of one part
-
time and four full
-
time custodians ensures classrooms, 
restrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe on
 
a daily basis. A scheduled maintenance program is administered 
by the District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and provide a suitable learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one 
priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are 
proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A w
ork order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff has indicated that 100% of all toilets on 
school grounds are in working order.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The 
District contributes to the deferred maintenance fund (Fund 14) to cover annual maintenance costs that occur 
through
-
out the year or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems.  These maintenance costs are 
typically for major repairs.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Projects
 
For the 2018
-
2019 school year the district completed several projects at the Junior High, Redwood,
 
Sequoia, and Golden 
Oak sites.  The District's complete deferred maintenance plan is available at the District office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.
