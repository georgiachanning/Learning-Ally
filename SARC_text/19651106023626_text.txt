By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
November 2018
 
 


ecision to purchase instructional 
materials aligned with the State Standards. Currently, all teachers in grades K
-
8 have access to math curriculum that 
supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, whic
h includes 


Reading 
and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study are aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Sta
ndards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curriculum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. P
honics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficiently use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purch
ased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of each school year for all students. In addition, there 
is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the ye
ar to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complie
s with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take textbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supple
mental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an established a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full implemen
tation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials aligned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 
recommendation 

to ensure that the most appropriate materials are identified for our students.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sorensen Elementary School was built in 1947 on land donated by Christian Sorensen, a long time resident in the Whittier 
area. Sorensen has a 
total of 14 regular education classes, in addition to two Severely Handicapped Special Day classes 
(one primary (K
-
2) and one upper (3rd 

 
5th) grade). In addition, we have a newly redesigned library funded through the 
Wonder of Reading and school fundrais
ers.
 
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Sorensen has an eight
-
 
hour day 
custodian and four
-
 
hour night custodian. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules 
to
 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Sorensen Elementary School offers a safe and secure campus. During the summer of 2014, a new roof was installed and 
the front building was modernized, including the staff lounge, front office, workroom and restrooms using 
Measure Z 
funding. The school is fully air conditioned and provides up
-
to
-
date facilities and adequate space for students and staff.  
Sorensen Elementary is comprised of a kindergarten area, library, a cafeteria, and 26 classrooms. The school also enjoys 
a
 
spacious playground with swings, a slide and play bars, as well as grassy fields for running, sports and games.
 
 
Sorensen also has the "Reach for the Stars" afterschool program that provides enrichment, remediation, homework help 
and activities until 6:00
 
PM each evening.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the 
State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education populati
on and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are align
ed with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the re
quirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Sorensen Science Academy is very appreciative and proud of the support that parents provide to our campus. Our parent 
nights, awards assemblies, teacher
-
parent conferences, and fundraisers are always well attended. Parents volunteer on a 
daily basis in the
 
classroom and in our Parent Room. There are numerous opportunities for parents to become involved 
in the educational program at Sorensen Science Academy.  Parents are encouraged to become members of the School 
Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory 
Committee (ELAC), Parent/Teacher Association (PTA), Room Ambassadors, and 
District Advisory Committees (DELAC). For more information about organized activities and events and other opportunities 
for parent involvement, please contact Laura Camacho or Alici

Parents also have opportunities to learn and grow. Literacy workshops, Parenting Classes, and Nutrition workshops are 
offered throughout the year. Parents are also invited to attend many school activities throughout the year,
 
including our 
Coffe with the Principal, that features different topics, such as Technology, Math, Reading, our annual Family Science 
Night, Night Under the Stars, Maker's Fair and Literacy Night where families have the opportunity to read and do hands
-
on 
science and math together that align with the Common Core State Standards. Sorensen has an active and involved PTA 
that sponsors events that will benefit our students. Highlights include educational assemblies, field trips, fundraisers, and
 
the Scholastic 
Book fair. We are very fortunate to count with excellent parental support.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Sorensen Science Academy is a closed campus and gates are kept locked during school hours. Teachers follow a schedule 
for recess duty on the playground, helping ensure that the playground rules are adhered to for student safety at all times. 
Sorensen Scien
ce Academy believes that a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a positive learning 
experience for all students.
 
 
 
Sorensen Science Academy is committed to the safety and security of each student. Sorensen has a well
-
organized disaster 
prepa
redness plan that includes updated emergency equipment and supplies which was reviewed, updated, and discussed 
on December 11, 2019. In accordance with SB187 and EC 35294.6, all schools have adopted a Safe School Action Plan. 
These plans are reviewed annua
lly are available for public view in the school office. Disaster drills, lockdowns, 
 
and fire 
drills are conducted monthly. Our Health Aide is trained in First Aid and CPR, as are most of the teachers and the principal.
 
The Health Aide assists students in 
the event of minor injury as well as in routine health issues. Additionally, a positive 
relationship exists between Sorensen and the Pico Rivera Sheriff Department. They support us with law and traffic 
enforcement when needed, as well as providing annual s
afety assemblies for the students.  Local law enforcement 
agencies provide ongoing support to the school and coordinates with school and district personnel in case of a campus or 
neighborhood threat.  We continuously revisit and update our school plan as w
e practice our drills throughout the year.
