School Description
 
Dear Community Members and Parents,
 
 
Ord Terrace Elementary School is a TK
-
5th grade elementary school overlooking Monterey Bay in 
Seaside, California. We are proud of our dynamic and diverse staff, 
hard
-
working students, and 

mission: to provide a positive learning environment, establish high expectations, and work 
collaboratively with each other, families, and
 
the community to ensure all students achieve 
academic success and demonstrate social responsibility. Ord Terrace staff members are dedicated 
to the belief that all children can learn and grow in a safe, orderly and positive environment.
 
 
Ord Terrace is a 
school that places social justice front and center. Our school
-
wide theme is "Our 
voices shape our world." We believe that all students should feel empowered to use their voices to 
share their unique perspectives and make positive changes within our school
 
and local 
communities, as well as within the world. Throughout the school year, students are engaged in six 
elements of inquiry
-
based learning: understanding of self, understanding of others, understanding 
social justice issues, understanding change movem
ents, raising awareness for issues students feel 
are important, and engaging in social justice actions. Students learn how to use empowering 
academic language and develop strong social relationships to voice their opinions and become 
change agents who cont
ribute to civic discourse and positive individual and collective actions.
 
 
Ord Terrace uses a Multi
-
tiered System of Supports (MTSS) approach for academic learning and 
social emotional learning (SEL). All students receive high
-
quality core instruction, as 
well as 
differentiated instruction that targets each student's individual needs. We have several 
paraprofessional and certificated support staff who take a team approach. We monitor the 
progress of students in our intensive interventions and adjust the pro
grams as needed. Ord Terrace 
staff is implementing a school
-
wide Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) framework. 
PBIS is a multi
-
tiered model that teaches students how to respect and value self and others, and 
integrates and sustains evidence
-
based interventions to meet the behavior needs of all students. 
We believe in the importance of providing an environment in which the unique talents, needs, and 
abilities of every member of our school community are supported. The consistency of this appro
ach 
benefits the needs of all students at Ord Terrace. As part of PBIS, we implement the Playworks 
structured recess program. This promotes a fun recess time and prevents bullying. We also use the 
Olweus program that promotes community
-
building, fostering 
respect, and prevention of unkind 
behaviors.
 
 
Most importantly, our school thrives on collaboration. Building a Professional Learning Community 
(PLC) and collegiality helps give staff the knowledge, attitudes and skills to provide powerful 
learning environ
ments for all students. In addition to weekly grade
-
level data analysis PLCs, staff 
comes together in various groups to study research
-
based methods and brainstorm strategies to 
implement high quality instructional practices.

Major Achievements 
 

 
We believ
e social justice is a critical outcome of education, and we are proud of the work we have accomplished so far to lay 
the groundwork for this school
-
wide focus.
 

 
We have several Instructional Assistants who support targeted, intensive interventions to studen
ts throughout the school day.
 

 
We host a Newcomer Academy to support elementary school students who are new to MPUSD and are at the emerging level 
of English language acquisition.
 

 
We use an integrated model to blend our special education programs with 
our general education programs when possible. 
Collaboration between special education staff and general education staff enhances the delivery of instruction for all studen
ts.
 

 
Our teachers have completed rigorous professional development sessions for common
 
core close reading, math, and English 
Language Development. All staff have a growth mindset and believe that learning is a continuous process that never stops, 
even for adult learners.
 

 
We hold family nights every year. During these evenings, families come
 
and participate in activities that help enrich the 
connections between school and home learning.
 

 
We were the first school in Monterey County to implement Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS), and have had 
a consistent program for more than 1
0 years.
 
I invite anybody to visit our school to see the hard work of our students and staff in action! I look forward to giving you a
 
personal tour!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Joe Sampson
 
 
Principal
 
 
About the SARC
 
By Fe
bruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Fu
nding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address stat
e and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on August 2019, and determined that
 
the school had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, incl
uding English learners, are given 
their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or i
nstructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the 
school
 
the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made
 
to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for
 
parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of the California Common 
Core standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials 
used at the school.

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our local 
schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965, more than 50 years ago, and 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 million sch
ool facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional detai
ls.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online 
supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The impo
rtant purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this 
assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligi
ble students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

ly involvement at Ord Terrace. We believe that parents are an integral part of our work and view parents as 
partners with the school and students.
 
 
The school convenes an annual meeting to inform parents and families of Title I students about Title I requi
rements and about the right of parents and 
families to be involved. A minimum of one meeting is held each year to explain the Title I program. During the annual meeting
, the school provides 
parents and families with an explanation of the curriculum used at
 
the school, the assessments used to measure student progress, and the proficiency 
levels students are expected to meet. During the annual meeting, achievement data, including state tests for English language
 
arts (ELA), math, and 
science, and English Lear
ner Proficiency Assessment Consortium (ELPAC) data is made available and explained to the parents and families.
 
 
Family members can volunteer in the classrooms, in the cafeteria, on field trips, and during special events such as school
-
wide learning celebr
ations. 
Parents are often on campus assisting with different activities, attending workshops, and celebrating student achievement. We
 
understand that parents' 
schedules can vary, and we offer flexible scheduling opportunities so busy parents can participat
e in school activities in a variety of ways.

We invite parents to give feedback by attending our active English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Parent Teacher Organiz
ation (PTO), and School 
Site Council (SSC) meetings. All of these groups allow parent
s opportunities to give input about the school's program as well as learn more about how to 
support their children. Our ELAC is focused on reviewing information about English Learners. Parents also learn about how to 
support their students' 
needs as they a
cquire English language skills. Our SSC parents work side by side with the faculty and staff to help allocate and monitor the
 
use of Title 1 
funds. Parents and families are invited to serve on the School Site Council and/or are always welcome to attend the
 
School Site Council meetings whether 
serving on the Board or not. The ELAC Board is asked to report as an advisory committee to the School Site Council at least o
nce per year. Data review 
and explanation, program effectiveness, and revisions to the parent
 
and family engagement policy, and the current School
-
Parent Compact are agenda 
items during the annual Title I meeting. The PTO meets to conduct fundraisers, plan celebrations, and provide a forum for sha
ring compliments and 
concerns. The principal and th
e bilingual family liaison are the contact people for all questions about parent involvement. We administer a school
-
wide 
family survey to measure parent involvement as well as improve our engagement of families. The school offers a flexible numbe
r of meet
ings for parents, 
such as meetings in the morning or evening. The school involves parents and families in an organized, ongoing, and timely way
, in the planning, review, 

agement policy. The school solicits input from parents and families 
and the School Site Council at least once each year.
 
 
We believe parents and teachers should have clear lines of communication. Parents and families are given the option to meet w
ith their
 
child's teacher 
during parent conferences at least once per year. Parents and families can always request to meet with their child's teacher 
at additional times. The 
school provides parents and families of Title I students with timely information about pr
ograms. Information is communicated regularly through the 
monthly newsletters, the school website, through ParentSquare, at other parent and family meetings such as PTO, ELAC, and SSC
, and the at yearly Title 
I Meeting. Parents can contact the principal by
 
phone at 831

All teachers receive ongoing professional development aligned to the school's SPSA and district LCAP. Student achievement dat
a (Smarter 
Balanced, 
ELPAC, and curriculum
-
based assessments) indicated that English Learners had the greatest needs for academic growth, and thus all professional 
development has been aligned with those needs. Each year, teachers attend approximately 40 hours of on
-
site after school professional development. 
Topics include administering and analyzing running records, planning guided reading with English Learner scaffolding, small g
roup math instruction, Zearn 
math implementation, teaching writing with English Learner
 
supports and Tier 2 reading instruction. Teachers have received ongoing professional 
development on PBIS systems, including positive teacher language, Tier 1 supports, and developing positive relationships thro
ugh daily class meetings.
 
 
During professiona
l development cycles, teachers receive ongoing coaching support from a full time academic coach and the principal. Teachers m
onitor 
student learning using formative assessments and meet weekly with their colleagues to analyze data and plan instruction that
 
integrates the learning 
from the professional development.
