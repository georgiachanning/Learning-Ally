School Description
 
At Henry Dalton Elementary School, we believe that students, parents and staff members, working 
together as partners, will ensure that learning and achievement are encouraged and highly valued, 
and that positive 
social behavior is expected.  We believe that students have the right to learn and 
teachers have the right to teach.  We believe that students and staff members have the right to a 
safe, civil and productive school environment.  We believe that students ha
ve the right to expect a 
calm, friendly environment, with clear behavioral expectations and discipline policies that are 
consistently and fairly administered.  Dalton is a student
-
centered community focused on 
promoting educational excellence. The staff wo
rks to ensure students receive quality instruction, 
diverse opportunities, and develop academically and socially. Dalton programs include a STEM 
pathway in partnership with Slauson Middle School, Center Middle School, Gladstone High School 
and Azusa High S
chool; a PBIS program to support positive behavior interventions; Early Bird/ Late 
Bird Kindergarten program which provides small group instruction for younger students; 
instrumental music for fifth graders; physical education curriculum; OLWEUS Bully Prev
ention 
Program; after school academic intervention; and a Response to Instruction intervention and 
enrichment model in English Language Arts. There are also partnerships with community programs 
through companies, Azusa Pacific University, and community gro
ups that support families and 
students. There are opportunities for parent engagement, such as Coffee with the Principal, 
Families in Schools, Math Game Day, Parent Education Opportunities and informational 
presentations which are offered to promote learni
ng outside of the regular school day. Technology 
is also an important component of the program at Dalton. The school has a full computer lab, iPad

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each y
ear, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCF
F) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priori
ties. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/gu
ardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
