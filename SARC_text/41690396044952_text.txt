About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe and functional. To assist in these
 
efforts, the 
District has developed and the Board of Trustees
 
has approved, a District
-
wide Facilities Implementation Master Plan in order to bring each school site 
up to district facility standards for educational excellence. To support that effort, in 2008 the community passed a $175 mil
lion facilities bond to rep
air, 
renovate, upgrade and increase capacity at District schools. Bond funding has been used to upgrade facilities over the past 1
0 years. College Park 
underwent a full modernization encompassing all classrooms and the multi
-
purpose building. A new adminis
tration building was constructed, a lunch 
shade structure and age
-
appropriate play structures were added to the campus, student classroom furniture was replaced, exterior painting was 
completed and perimeter fencing was installed for school security.
 
 
In 2
015, the community once again passed a $142 million bond (Measure X). Phase I is well underway, adding classrooms and a gym a
t Abbott and Borel 
and a gym at Bayside Academy, in addition to a new fourth elementary school in Foster City.
 
 
With the passing of
 
the State Facilities Bond in November 2016, the District will seek any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage bas
is to 
assist with the expenditures for any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Maintenance staff ensures th
at the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner, 
while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program called "Akita Box"
 
is used to ensure e
fficient 
service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs in a timely manner,
 
the maintenance department 

 
 
Most District schools are staffed with at least one day and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. Some of the larger 
schools, particularly the middle schools, are staffed with one day custodian and two or three night custodi
ans. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custodial staff follows t

which are available at the District Office. In add
ition, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California's Office of Public 
School Construction to evaluate the conditions of each schools facility. This evaluation is completed annually for each site.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/liter
acy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core Sta
te Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Professional Development
 
 
The San Mateo
-
Foster City School District is 
committed to providing quality professional development opportunities for all staff. Training is available 
through three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release
 
days and during the 
sum
mer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the im
plementation of our 
adopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning
 
opportunities integrate content 
development and research
-
based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and 
Socio
-
economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is g
rounded in the California State Standards and the research from the 
California State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in l
anguage and literacy, 
science and mathematics. Middle School te
achers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards and strategies to support 
conceptual understanding and improve student learning.
 
 
Teachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or de
partment specific PD, teacher learning communities within and 
across sites and in departments or grade levels 
-
 
both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district
-
level training with site
-
based 
professional development opportunities bas
ed on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed professional learning opportunities by 
evaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and fe
edback surveys) fro
m teacher 
and leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strate
gies during the year. We also 
evaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on
-
going examination of student 
performance data (academic and wellness). District 
leadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for
 
student successes and 
challenges, to monitor the impact of key professional gro

SPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade
-
level and classroom data), 
where the
y couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month
-
to
-
month adjustments in professional learning 
strategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union
 
representatives to elicit their 
feedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the dist
rict LCAP. Additionally, 
starting this year, SMFCSD will gather once
-
a
-
year survey feedback from t
eachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current 
strategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.
 
 
Our beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provid
ed by our District
-
based Induction program. Veteran teachers can 
participate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.
