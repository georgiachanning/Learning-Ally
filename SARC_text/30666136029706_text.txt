By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

All textbooks used in the core curriculum are aligned with the California Content Standards and Frameworks per the 
adoption process outlined 
by the state. Once the State Board of Education adopts standards

based instructional materials, 
the District field tests materials and then adopts according to Board Policy. There are sufficient materials at each school 
that are used to support core instru
ction. The adoption cycle has been adhered to and newly adopted materials are readily 
accessible to all students. All schools use adopted materials and site

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
In November of 2016, the Ocean View School 
District (OVSD) passed Measure R, a general obligation bond, in the amount 
of 169 million dollars. This is the first bond ever passed in the 143 year history of OVSD. The bond program is designed to 
transform the aging fleet of 1960/1970 era schools into m
odern, contemporary learning environments. Construction 
started in late June of 2018 and is anticipated to take approximately eight years to complete ending somewhere in the 
2024/2025 school year.

The District currently embraces a systematic approach to m
aintaining the current facilities to ensure that all schools are 
clean, safe, and provide an inspirational educational environment for our students to learn, grow, and be challenged. 
District maintenance and site custodial staff work in a coordinated manne
r to ensure that the repairs and operational 
items necessary to keep the schools in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A comprehensive work order 
system is utilized by school and District staff to communicate both routine and non
-
routine main
tenance requests. 
Emergency repairs are given the highest priority. 
 
 
From an operational perspective, the custodian inspects the facilities for safety hazards or other conditions that need 
attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. One
 
full
-
time day custodian and one or two part
-
time 
evening custodian(s) are assigned to each school site. The day custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Lunch area setup/cleanup
 

 
General grounds maintenance
 

 
Grounds keeping
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
Restrooms are checked reg
ularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The evening 
custodian is responsible for:
 

 
Classroom cleaning
 

 
Office area cleaning
 

 
Restroom cleaning
 
 
The principals are in continual communication with the Maintenance and 
Operations Supervisors and custodial staff 
concerning maintenance and school safety issues.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Ocean View School District has instructional priorities that are the focus for all professional development. Professional 
development is collaboratively planned with the Ocean View Teachers 
Association to ensure that it meets the needs of 
students and staff and that it aligns with the District and State priorities. There are two non
-
student professional 
development days each year. There are also five modified Wednesdays for elementary schools
 
that focus on site
-
specific 
needs. The first District professional development focused on Depth
-
of
-
Knowledge (DOK) levels 3 and 4. Training is 
interactive and teachers worked collaboratively with colleagues to develop student demonstration lessons to impl
ement 
throughout the school year. The second non
-
student training day focused on DOK. At the elementary level, DOK 4 was 
revisited through the lens of Next Generation Science Standards. OVSD is developing a Twilight Series of professional 
development that 
will be offered after school to sustain District initiatives such as Write From the Beginning, Thinking 
Maps, Depth and Complexity icons, the Writing Continuum, and mathematical practices. As a District, we have a structure 
that allows us to stay the cours
e and provide ongoing sustainable training.
 
 
In 2018

Throughout the year, teaching staff are provided the opportunity to participate in District
-
sponsored staff development 
workshops or training sessions as:
 
1) a supplement to site
-
based staff development,
 
2) for 
reinforcement of or follow
-
up on previous training, or
 
3) follow
-
up training for newly implemented programs/curricula.
 
 
Star View Elementary School offers support to new and veteran teachers through peer coaching and mentoring. 
Instructional aides are prov
ided targeted training focused on teaching strategies and curriculum content. Substitute 
teachers are invited to participate in designated staff development activities. All staff are encouraged to attend 
professional workshops and conferences. Classified s
upport staff receive job
-
related training from department supervisors 
and District representatives.
