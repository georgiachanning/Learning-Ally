About the
 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local
 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to a
ddress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For addition
al information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

School Safety Plan
 
The school safety plan for West Street School is on file at the district office, at Corning Police Department, and in our sch
ool office. This plan identifies 
the appropriate strategies and programs to provide and maintain a high level of school safety. The
 
plan addresses, in detail, the following items: current 
status of school crime, child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, school discipline, suspension and expulsion pr
ocedures, teacher 
notification of suspensions and/or expulsion, sexual har
assment policies, dress codes, and general school safety. The school safety plan was last reviewed, 
discussed, and updated in January 2020.
 
 
Additionally, all students were provided copies of the disciplinary matrix, including reasons for suspensions and e
xpulsions. The matrix details 
consequences for similar infractions  of the education code and consequences for dissimilar infractions of the education code
 
and school rules.
