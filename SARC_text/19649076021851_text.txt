Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's Message
 
It is my pleasure to be serving my seventh year as principal of Harrison. As a former Harrison student I am proud to be 
back home and ensuring our students have an 
educational experience that will leave a lasting impression . I am a Pomona 
High graduate as well and am very proud to be able to give back to the same community I was raised in. I welcome you to 
Harrison! Please feel free to visit our school at any time.
 
 
Our school program reflects the goals and objectives of parents, staff, and community. Our responsibility is to provide an 
education that challenges our students personally, socially and academically. It is our belief that by enhancing the 
educational exp
eriences of all students here at Harrison, they will develop a commitment to academic excellence as 21st 
Century Learners.
 
 
Harrison provides a safe and clean learning environment. While the facilities are over 50 years old, the staff works to 
maintain the
 
campus that is conducive to student learning. Harrison School received some state modernization funds in 
1992 and air conditioning was added to the classrooms. In addition, the front office was renovated during the summer of 
2003. Other renovations includ
e the addition of an outdoor benches in
 
 
our lunch area, tables and benches in our playground area, new landscaping in front of the school, iron fencing and gates 
and an electronic marquee. The district provides a facilities department to make needed repai
rs to maintain a clean 
campus in addition to our top notch custodian. We are proud to share that our school passed the Williams inspection with 
an EXEMPLARY status as well!

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

We have developed partnerships with the  Cal
-
Poly Pomona, Harvey Mudd University, The Kiwanis of Pomona, Pomona 
Police Great Program, The American Red Cross, The United Way, The Webb Foundation, and other local bu
sinesses and 
church organizations to support the educational program at Harrison School in addition to donating goods and services.
 
 
The PTSA  sponsors various fundraising events that promotes school spirit among the school community in addition to 
providi
ng resources for monthly  PBIS  and recognition incentives for citizenship, most improved, and academic excellence.
 
 
Other parent committees include:
 
*The School Site Council (SSC), which is composed of parents and school staff that meet monthly to provide
 
input and 
support to school programs.
 
*The English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) supports the development of all programs for English
 
Language Learners.
 
 
Other parent committees include the District Advisory Council (DAC) and the District English Lear
ner Advisory Council 
(DELAC). Students also benefited from our parent volunteers who shared their special talents working in the classroom as 
well as during after
-
school activities. At Harrison, we practice the theory that it takes a village to raise a chi
ld and therefore 
encourage parents as well as community members to submit volunteer applications every year! We believe that everyone 
has something positive to offer a child.
 
 
We also provide Parent Education on various topics throughout the year and often
 
invite guest speakers to present 
important information to our parents.
 
 
If you have any questions regarding parent involvement opportunities, please call the front office at (909) 397

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety: Safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of the Pomona Unified School District. All schools in the distr
ict 
are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials. Staff attended a training 
on 
October  11, 2019 and a disaster preparedness plan is in place for earthquakes and emergency evacuations. All buildings 
within the district are in compliance with state earthquake standards. A discipline policy may be found at each school that 
seeks to 
insure a safe and orderly environment for students and staff. A Safe School Plan has been adopted, and it includes 
policies on disaster preparedness and emergency procedures.
 
 
In addition, fire drills and disaster drills are conducted 
consistently throughout the year to increase safety awareness every 
member of the school community.
 
 
Harrison staff reviewed and made revisions to its Safety plan on November 11, 2019 to ensure plan was updated and 
accurate for implementation.

then design effective instructional interventions

as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching and learning, the essential components of
 
the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/support instruction and learning. Perform
