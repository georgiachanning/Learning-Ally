By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are clean and safe for students, 
teachers and staff. The district follows a c
omprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance program to offset costly 
repairs and minimize disruptions to the instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure that classrooms, offices 
and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. Nicolas Valley El
ementary has one full time lead custodian during school 
hours. After school hours, the entire facility is cleaned by a night crew. In addition, between two and three times a year 
the carpets are steam cleaned. In order to respond to work requests in a time
ly manner, the district utilizes an electronic 
work order system. When a site secretary, custodian or administrator has a request, they can put it into the system 
directly. This makes for a more time efficient processing of work orders.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement 
(Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate As
sessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement stan
dards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the 
University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan, which is 
updated and approved annually by the School Site Council. The plan covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress 
and egress, a
nd ensuring a safe and orderly environment. Additionally, the plan includes data on suspensions and 
expulsions as well as school and district crime data.
 
 
Our school is a secured campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. School visitors and volunteers are 
required to sign in at 
the front office prior to entering campus thorough our computer system. This school year, we implemented a closed 
campus in the mornings; only people volunteering or with an appointment are allowed past the office.  In instances of 
e
mergency, we use an automated telephone system to contact parents with pertinent information.
 
 
To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our schools conducts fire, earthquake and lock down 
drills regularly throughout the school ye
ar. Education Code mandates that all elementary and middle schools hold a fire 
drill each month they are in session as well as an earthquake drill at least four times during the school year.
 
 
School Safety Plan is being reviewed and will be 
approved at November/December School Site Council Meeting.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational 
experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented 
during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal observations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to local and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in 
specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and provide instructional support as teacher
 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessions bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curri
culum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices
 
for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinement committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Lea
rning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze stude
nt achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
