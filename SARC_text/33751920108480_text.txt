Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Crowne Hill Elementary School was built in 2005. It consists of 51 permanent classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library, 
and an administrat
ive building. TVUSD's Maintenance and Operations division works diligently to ensure our facilities are 
clean and safe for students, teachers and staff. The district follows a comprehensive preventive and deferred maintenance 
program to offset costly repai
rs and minimize disruptions to the instructional program. Daily cleaning schedules ensure 
that classrooms, offices and bathrooms are clean and well maintained. Crowne Hill Elementary School has one full time 
lead custodian during school hours, and a night 
crew that comes in and cleans the entire facility after school hours. In 
addition, between two and three times a year the carpets are steam cleaned.In order to respond to work requests in a 
timely manner, the district utilizes an electronic work order syst
em. When a site secretary, custodian or administrator has 
a request, they can put it into the system directly. This makes for a more time efficient processing of work orders.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or 
career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School safety is a high priority for our school and district. Our school has a comprehensive School Safety Plan. The plan 
covers topics such as disaster response, safe ingress and egress and ensuring a safe and orderly environment. Additionally, 
the plan i
ncludes data on suspensions and expulsions as well as school and district crime data.  The safety plan is reviewed 
and revised every year based on current staffing and site needs.
 
 
Our school is a closed campus that is fully enclosed by fencing. School vis
itors and volunteers are required to sign in at the 
front office prior to entering campus, where an electronics system verifies through the driver's license.  In instances of 
emergency, we use an automated telephone system to contact parents with pertinent
 
information or we email using our 
Infinite Campus information.

To better prepare our teachers, students and staff for emergencies, our school conducts fire drills monthly throughout 
the school year, as well as an earthquake drill at least four times duri
ng the school year. In addition, we practice lock down 
protocols periodically to be prepared in the event of an active emergency. In August 2019, all teachers and staff attended 
a Run, Hide, Fight training to be better prepared in the event of an active as
sailant. We have a comprehensive disaster 
plan prepared should a disaster occur. We have put into place a command post, safety team, first aid station, reunification 
area, utility team and counseling/comfort area. We utilize staff development training days
 
to gather feedback and ideas 
from teachers to better develop our emergency routines.

District Commitment to Learning for All Students
 
 
The Temecula Valley Unified School District is committed to ensuring that each and every child in its care receives a 
rigorous, multifaceted educational experience preparing them for the demands of college and career.
 
 
TVUSD teachers engage in active staff
 
development throughout the year by attending:
 
 
In
-
District training sessions provided by staff and consultants.
 
 
Site
-
based training sessions presented during staff meetings and committee/grade level meetings.
 
 
One on one training provided during formal o
bservations and post observation conferences.
 
 
Staff members are sent to national and state conferences to fine
-
tune instructional practices in specific areas.
 
 
Teachers with specialized training are given opportunities to train their peers, and 
provide instructional support as teacher 
leaders.
 
 
Standards Based Instruction
 
 
Staff development focuses on implementing the New State Standards and state frameworks in English
-
Language Arts, 
Science, social science, and Math, K
-
12. Routine district sessi
ons bring teacher leaders and principals together to devise 
and refine the curriculum and assessments. Teams began by identifying priority and supporting standards, grouping the 
standards into units of instruction, and crafting common interim and summative
 
assessments, developing scoring rubrics, 
and discussing sound grading practices for each course/grade. Leaders return to sites to facilitate their grade level/course 
teams in reviewing the work, suggesting resources, and providing feedback for the refinem
ent committees.
 
 
Collaborative Teams
 
 
Teachers are divided into Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on content area and grade level. All 
instructional staff participate almost weekly during professional growth time meeting in their PLC groups to
 
align 
curriculum, refine teaching strategies, create assessments, analyze student achievement data and transition to New State 
Standards.
