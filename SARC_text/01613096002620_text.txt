By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Hillside Elementary School is located in the San Lorenzo Unified School District in the San Francisco Bay A
rea. The school 
was built in 1956 and a two
-
story building with fourteen classrooms was added in 2001. In June 2011, construction was 
completed on a new library and three new classrooms. Throughout the years Hillside School has maintained its position 
as a
n important part of the surrounding community.   Our vision for our students is to be a community of lifelong learners 
built on the principles of high expectations for academic achievement, an unwavering focus on educational equity and 
collaboration with o
ur surrounding community.  Hillside School promotes a school

has selected programs that provide 
an environment in which students can grow and learn.  We have 18 classroom 
teachers, one Teacher on Special Assignment who provides services in literacy, intervention, English Language 
Development and assessment,   The Teacher on Special Assignment works w
ith classroom teachers to provide a three

housing 15 classrooms to replace portables, w
as completed. Hillside Elementary School has been allocated 76 hours of 
custodial time per week and the services of a District maintenance crew to ensure that the school and grounds are clean 
and well maintained. Voters passed Measure E in 2005, and Measur
e 0, passed in 2008, which provided funding for 
construction of a beautiful state of the art library and three classrooms which opened in April 2010 and currently house 
our intervention programs. In Fall 2013

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for Engl
ish language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked w

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and
 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School 
Safety Plan that is reviewed every year.  We have regular safety drills to prepare our students for fire, earthquake

students and maintain student safety at all times.  We also are implementing mindfulness in the classrooms to promote 
the overall well being of our students and to improve focus an
d academic achievement. All visitors are required to sign in

At Hillside School, we aspire to be a Professional Learning Community.  As an active PLC, we consider every collegial 
interaction to be an opportunity 
for Professional Development.  During our twice
-
monthly staff meetings we devote time 
to collaborating in grade
-
level teams regarding differentiated instruction, and equitable instructional practices in our 
classrooms and school
-
wide  This year, in particu
lar, we are targeting our newly adopted reading curriculum Fountas and 
Pinell Classroom 2018 and Balanced Literacy Practices. In addition, we continue providing PDs on  Writers Workshop to 
align with expectations for the Common Core standards and thus supp
ort academic success for our students. All teachers 
received professional development on the Fountas & Pinell Classrooms reading curriculum. Teachers are also participating 
in ongoing balanced literacy coaching cycles with our district and on
-
site literacy
 
coaches. We also continue to investigate 
our own Equity Practices as school staff in order to provide the most culturally appropriate environment for our students.
 
 
In addition, all teachers participate in weekly Collaboration Time with an emphasis on ana
lyzing student work and planning 
instruction that will challenge students to meet their full potential.  All teachers have access to Illuminate and NWEA to 
review the results of state, district and site assessments, and student demographics.
 
 
The Education
al Services Department of the San Lorenzo Unified School District is currently providing professional 
development for all teachers in Balanced Literacy.  All Hillside teachers have been trained and are receiving ongoing 
support in the EL Achieve curriculum
.
 
 
All teachers have the opportunity to improve their skills by taking college courses, District workshops, and in
-
services or 
other workshops offered by the County Office of Education. Teachers may attend professional conferences supported by 
site or Dist
rict funding.  Since the integration of technology is important to student success, teachers also have access to 
on
-
site and District workshops for technology integration.  This year school year 2019
-
2020, Five  New Teachers have 
participated in the Projec
t Lean In technology integration training, and have received class sets of Chromebooks for 
student use.
 
 
Professional Development for New Teachers:
 
Through participation in the Contra Costa County Office of Education's Beginning Teacher Support and Assessm
ent (BTSA) 
Induction Program, the District secures support providers to work with our new teachers. Through this BTSA Induction 
Program, new teachers are also afforded the opportunity to take university
-
level courses at a reduced tuition cost. This 
program
 
offers training to new teachers for two years, as they sharpen their skills as educators. The induction portion of 
this program leads them to acquire their clear credential through the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
