By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The staff of Hansen 

aesthetic and safety conditions are made by the principal on a monthly basis, and thorough quarterly inspections are made 

Maintenance, Operations, and Transportation. Custodians make routine, daily inspections of 
all exterior and interior areas of the school. As per SB550 all facilities are in good repair. Modernization projects were 
completed on the Hansen campus during the 
past several years as a result of the passage of Measure N at the November 
4, 2008 election and Measure G at the June 5, 2012 election.   Classrooms and office spaces were enhanced with new 
furniture, upgraded wall systems, energy efficient dual
-
paned wind
ows, new energy efficient heating and air conditioning 
units, new plumbing, electrical, and upgraded roofing. Hansen School's heating and air conditioning units, lighting, security
 
cameras, classroom projectors, and even irrigation systems are on energy ma
nagement systems, controlled remotely to 
ensure that units do not run during times they are not needed. Preschool and before
-
and
-
after
-
school childcare programs 
were relocated to provide better access for parents during hours when the school office is not 
open.  School security 
enhancements are multi
-
faceted and include perimeter fencing, security cameras throughout the campus, paging systems, 
emergency notification systems, enhanced fire alarm systems, and increased security lighting after school hours.  T
he

of safety for students with minimal 
maintenance requirements. Regular maintenance projects take place to maintain the 

hing 
station and flat screen monitors was complet
ed.  In the summer of 2016, a second Technology Learning Center with an 
additional 32 computers with flat screen monitors was added.  In the summer of 2019, a third Technology Learning Center 
was added.  A STEM Center with additional computers with flat sc
reen monitors was added in 2017.  In addition, there 
are six computers in every classroom and various classrooms throughout the site utilize iPads as part of the instructional 
program.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
