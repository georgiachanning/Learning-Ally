By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Sanger Unified retains an independent contractor to provide comprehensive facilities inspection of 
every school site. This 
inspection meets or exceeds the criteria of the State of California Williams inspection requirement. The Williams 
compliance inspections are done by Fresno County Office of Education (FCOE). Only one SUSD site is inspected by Fresno
 
County Office of Education annually for Williams compliance. This site is not a FCOE inspected site. The most recent 
inspection, either district or Williams, available when this SARC is prepared is utilized for this report. Inspection reports
 
are maintain
ed at the SUSD District Office.
 
 
The rating scale used for this inspection is as follows:
 
 
99% 
-
 
100% = Exemplary: School meets most/all standards of good repair. Noted deficiencies, if any, are not significant.
 
 
90% 
-
 
98.99% = Good: School 
maintained in good repair with some isolated deficiencies from wear/tear or are being 
mitigated.
 
 
75% 
-
 
89.99% = Fair: School is not in good repair with some critical or widespread deficiencies and repairs are necessary.
 
 
00% 
-
 
74.99% = Poor: School facili
ties are in poor condition with deficiencies of various degrees throughout and major 
repairs are necessary.
 
 
The results of the most recent report available for this campus are disaggregated below.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Our school strives to 
maintain an active Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). The Jefferson PTO works to support school

wide and individual classroom activities. This has often taken the form of support for Red Ribbon Week, a School Carnival 
and various holiday activities. We wel
come volunteers as general help in the office or for specific service in a classroom. 
Anyone wishing to become a member of our PTO may obtain an application at our Office. We also have parents serving in 
elective positions on our School Site Council (SSC) 
and English Language Advisory Committee, which direct our use of 
School Improvement (SI) funds and other categorical funds. Meetings are held throughout the year and all meetings are 
open to the public. We are also the only campus in the district to have N
eighborhood Resource Center (NRC) to provide 
assistance to local needy families in Sanger Unified. Please contact our office if you are interested in becoming more

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Jefferson School site has a Safe School Plan that is reviewed and updated annually. Plans are reviewed with staff annually 
often at the beginning of each School Year. Sanger Jefferson's School Site Council (SSC) approves our Safe School Plan. 
Emergency dri
lls are conducted to prepare students and staff in the event of an emergency. We strive to maintain a safe, 
healthful, nurturing and orderly school campus that encourages positive attitudes in students and staff. A joint effort 
between students and staff h
elp keep the campus clean and litter free. Site maintenance staffs survey their campus as the 
first order of business each day. They insure the campus is clean, any vandalism is corrected, and that the campus is 
presentable and representative of the priori
ty Sanger School Board sets on safety and appearance. Oversight of Sanger 
Unified Safe School Plans is through the Welfare and Attendance Officer. This site's Safe School Plan was reviewed with 
site staff in August 2019 and revisited throughout the year.

What are the primary/major areas of focus for staff development and specifically how were they selected? For example, 
were student achievement data used to determine the need for professional development in rea
ding instruction?
 
 
All of our professional development is based on the needs of our students and teachers, assessed through observations, 
surveys, disaggregation of SBAC data, PBIS data and other assessment data. Teachers in Sanger Unified have completed 
p
rofessional training courses designed to support educational priorities and objectives. Staff Development Days are 
designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers and classified personnel.
 
 
What are the methods by which p
rofessional development is delivered (e.g., after school workshops, conference 
attendance, individual mentoring, etc.)?
 
 
As a district, we are committed to offering teachers a variety of professional learning opportunities and options for 
personalized prof
essional development. Sanger Unified provides professional learning in all subjects (Math, STEAM, ELA, 
ELD, assessments etc.) for TK
-
6th grade teachers throughout the school year. For single
-
subject teachers, Sanger Unified 
provides two to four full days o
f training dedicated to specific initiatives, strategies and frameworks (Balanced Literacy, 
Guaranteed and Viable Instruction, ELD, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Close Reading, Project Based Learning, Universal 
Design for Learning, etc.) Sanger Unified 
also offers after
-
school workshops on various math instructional strategies and 
routines, after
-
school technology trainings and Universal Design for Learning trainings. Each year, we offer a district 
conference where teachers share their best practices wit
h one another. Teacher leaders at all sites are given a variety of 
opportunities to attend national and state conferences and seminars, as to further the collective knowledge of all 
members of their grade level teams and learning communities. Teachers also
 
have the opportunity to engage in 
personalized professional development through instructional coaching.
 
 
New to the profession Teachers are also supported through the Sanger Unified School District Beginning Teacher Support 
and Assessment Induction Progra
m (BTSA) and New Teacher Support. A teacher that is teaching under a PIP or STSP, or is 
an Intern is assigned a mentor that provides the new teacher with a minimum of 4 hours per week of direct or indirect 
support for his/her individualized professional gr
owth. In addition, the teachers attend required professional development 
provided by the district and school site. New teachers that have a preliminary credential participate in our formal BTSA 
Induction Program. Teachers participating in BTSA receive supp

the program may offer additional professional development offerings based on participant request and th

How are teachers supported during implementation (e.g., through in
-
class coaching,

performance data reporting, etc.)? With so many district initiatives, it is essential to have support for all teachers and 
administrators during implementation. Through many of our contracted trainings (Balanced Literacy
, NGSS, UDL), our 
expert trainers provide on
-
site support and follow up personalized coaching. There are varied levels of support, both at 
the site and district level. At school sites, teachers are supported during implementation by their grade
