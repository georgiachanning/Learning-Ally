Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

encourage them to be confident individuals with the competencies that will enable him or her to thrive in a diverse and 
competitive world.
 
 
Our core values:
 

 
Highly qualified veteran teachers
 

 
High Ex
pectations

Caring and supportive environment
 

 
Safe place
 
As the new principal of Meyer Elementary School, I look forward to joining and supporting the Meyer team and community 
in serving all our students, to ensure they
 
reach their fullest potential academically, socially and emotionally. Meyer is 
committed to creating 21st century
-
ready students through instructional technology integration and building students' 
capacities in crucial skills such as creativity, collabora
tion, critical thinking and communication, while adhering to the 
adoption of our new Common Core Standards. In addition, our goal is to ensure that every student meets or exceeds grade 
level standards, especially our English Language Learners. 
 
 
Meyer is a
 
Positive Behavior Intervention System school. We implement a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate 
a positive school culture. We believe that nurturing children's social
-
emotional development is just as important as 
delivering effective and releva
nt academic instruction. 
 
 
We foster a partnership with parents, guardians, and the community so that, together, we can provide the best services 
and opportunities possible to our students.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Meyer knows that parent 
involvement is essential to effective schooling of all our students. We foster a partnership with 
parents, guardians, and the community so , together, we can provide the best services and opportunities possible to our 
students. We provide a variety of foru
ms for parents to engage and participate, including PTA, SSC, ELAC, parent events 
and volunteer opportunities in our classrooms.
 
 
To ensure that parents receive the health, social, and other support services that are necessary to live healthy lives and 
pro
mote student achievement, Meyer provides parents with the skills and resources to access community and support 
services. Parents also attend the Student of the Month assemblies, PTA sponsored events, participate in fundraising 
events, and City Year After S

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Evidence of student safety at Meyer Elementary School includes monitoring of grounds and classrooms at all times by the 
administrator, teachers, 
custodians, para
-
professionals, and parent volunteers. All visitors are required to enter through 
the front office, sign in, and receive permission before proceeding into the campus. Our school has a very detailed, 
comprehensive school Safety Plan which ou
tlines protocols, systems, and procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. 
The plan also contains the yearly safety goals as determined by the students, staff, and parents. The Safety Plan is 
presented to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District 
Board of Trustees for approval. The plan was last updated 
in November 2017. The Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed throughout the year with all staff. Safety alerts are 
shared with all staff as needed throughout the school year. In addition, all
 
required drills are calendared and completed, 
and the results are shared with the staff. Meyer Elementary School has monthly fire drills, quarterly earthquake drills, and 
yearly Shelter in Place and Lockdown.

justification prior to spending, including careful review by our School 

 
 
Training is provided in differentiated instructional practices in the area of languag
e arts and math. The principal serves as 
a resource to classroom teachers to provide instructional strategies, test
-
taking skills and strategies, and technology 
training that will meet the needs of students not meeting standard in the SBAC. Categorical fun

professional development for staff, extended duty for academic support for students, and software that helps students 
fill in gaps in their learning and help them perform better on tests.
