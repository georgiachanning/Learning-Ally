School Description
 
The CHE community is here to ignite a love of learning and help develop empathy, passion,
 
and joy in each 
student. Through engaging activities, a community of kindness, and a "can do" attitude, all Calavera students 
will grow in their abilities and hopefully come to realize their capabilities.
 
 
Calavera Hills Elementary School (CHE) is a scien
ce, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) focused school 
that provides unique learning opportunities to its students. CHE utilizes Project Lead the Way (PLTW) modules, 
along with project
-
based learning in conjunction with core adopted curriculum to prov
ide a well
-
rounded 
education beginning in kindergarten. Students will leave fifth grade with experiences in STEM curriculum, an 
exposure to career pathways, and a readiness for the rigor of secondary school. CHE is a 1:1 device school. 
Such technology is i
ntegrated throughout the school day.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the learning needs 
of the students in their class, teachers differentiate based on these learning needs and they collaborate with 
grade level team teachers as we
ll as the principal to ensure students progress at every level.  Beyond the 
general education classroom, schools have Learning Center support, and depending upon the site, Special Day 
Classrooms, Guide counseling, and School Counselors.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQues
t is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; 
and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
We revise and update our school safety plan each year in the fall. Our current school safety plan meets all 
federal, state, and district standards for a comprehensive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, 
responding, and recovering from po
ssible threats (earthquakes, intruders,  fires) to ensure the safety of 
students, staff, and visitors. Our counselors, psychologists, and site administrators are extensively trained in 
threat assessment techniques by nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessment. To ensure safety 
on our campus, a school site safety committee conducts inspections to identify potential hazards. We have 
also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire and earthquake drills to familiarize 
sta
ff and students with emergency procedures. Our school site is also monitored for physical safety. Play 

undergo regular inspections. A new visitor c
heck
-
in system is being implemented, requiring all visitors to sign 
in and out.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
