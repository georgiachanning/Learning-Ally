By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
We, the parents, and staff, in partnership, will inspire our students with a rigorous, comprehensive standards
-
based 
academic foundation, fostering innovation, creativity, and critical thinking while incorporating 
visual and performing arts, 
technology, and athletics.  Our unique program will develop a strong sense of connectedness and responsibility for the 
world, our community, and each other.
 
 
Vision Statement
 
Innovative Horizons Charter School is a 
dependent charter within the Perris Elementary School District, serving students 
in grades K
-
8.  We believe that innovation, imagination, and invention are some of the skills we must teach our students 
to prepare them to be successful in the 21st century. 
 
Through rigorous standards based instruction, we are able to 
successfully integrate AVID Schoolwide, Project Based Learning opportunities, Visual and Performing Arts, Technology, 
and Athletics.  We value the involvement of our parents and ask all parents 
to commit to 40 hours of volunteer time each 
year.  Collectively, we are preparing our students to take their place in a global society.
 
 
Schoolwide programs that currently exist and align with the school's  Vision and Mission Statement are as follows:
 
 
AV
ID
 
IHCS has taken the innovation philosophy to the next level with school
-
wide AVID implementation. By using our AVID 
knowledge and strategies to transform our Instruction, Systems, Leadership, and Culture.  By focusing, developing, and 
enhancing these fou
r areas, we are ensuring college readiness for all of our students.  Being the only school within our 
district to take on a K
-
8 AVID School
-
wide program, each grade span is excited and dedicated to take our AVID program 
and focus on specified areas for imp
rovement, to include:  building parent communication and awareness, organization 
for all students, collaboration, and most importantly, tie in all elements of WICOR, making our students professionals and 
committed to their educational needs.
 
 
Project Based Learning Opportunities
 
Project Based Learning (PBL) provides the opportunities for teachers and students to work in an interdisciplinary way. 
Grade level teams develop and design projects such as Chef in the Classroom, Health Fair, Invention 
Fair, Force/Balance/ 
Motion Roller Coaster Project, and Cornell Project Feeder Watch. Once the PBL is completed, students publicly present 
the project. In turn, students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and
 
respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge.
 
 
Visual And Performing Arts
 
The Arts provides students with multiple ways of exploring, forming, expressing, communicating, and understanding their 
own and others' ideas and fe
elings. The Arts provides students with the skills necessary to express themselves in multiple 
ways; visually, aurally, verbally, and non
-
verbally. IHCS believes the arts have both an intrinsic and extrinsic value and that 
it provides a unique connection b
etween people both past and present. Additionally, IHCS recognizes that the Arts 
provides multiple ways for communicating, for gaining knowledge, and for understanding others thoughts, feelings, and 
perspectives. Visual And Performing Art courses change ea
ch year. The following are former or current VAPA courses 
offered to 6th
-
8th grade students:

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
Innovative Horizons Charter School, formerly known as Nan Sanders Elementary School, was built in 1985. The school 
consists of 38 regular classrooms, five county classrooms, a media center, a computer lab, a projects room, two 
multipurpose rooms (the large
r also serves as the cafeteria), a modified service kitchen, and 10 rest rooms. Several 
classrooms have new carpeting and the school office was recently painted. The playground now has a rubberized surface 
instead of wood chips.
 
 
More facts about the condi
tion of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by 
the Williams legislation of 2004. What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their 
structural integrity, electrical syst
ems, heating and ventilation systems, and more. The important purpose of this 
assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs to be repaired, this 
assessment identifies it and targets a date by which w
e commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment 
were written by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You 
can look at the six
-
page Facilities Inspection Tool used for the asse
ssment on the Web site of the OPSC.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to inspect them. They used a
 
survey, called the Facilities Inspection Tool, issued by the Office of Public School Construc

answered the questions you see on this report. Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as 
of the date of the report. Since that time, those conditions may have changed.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the nu
mber that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using onl

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are the primary socialization and founding facilitators of attitudes and behaviors related to academic 
perseverance. During our first parent meeting, we provide information about the importance of parent i
nvolvement. We 

behavior problems, are academically more successful, attend school regularly, have better social skills, and are more lik
ely 
to complete high school and go on to post
-
secondary education. We also inform parents that when parents are active 

security and c
onnectedness, and helps internalize the value of education and performance. At IHCS, we are committed in 
practicing and maintaining a positive, approachable, and clear interaction through a variety of structural approaches 
among all parents.
 
 
IHCS provides
 
multiple opportunities and invites parents to assist in the education of their students at the school site and 
at the district level.  The School Advisory Council (SAC), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), California 
Association for Bilingual Educ
ation (CABE), District Language Advisory Committee (DLAC), and District Parent Advisory 
Committee (DPAC)

are all weekly or monthly meetings that parents are welcome to attend. In creating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) and the charter's Loc
al Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), SAC parent committee 
members and an ELAC parent representative are involved in the provess. IHCS also encourages parents to volunteer 40 
hours each school year. Volunteer hours can be accomplished in a number of w
ays, from hands on assistance in the 
classroom to taking their children on an educational field trip to helping out in the teacher work room. Parents also have 
the opportunity to participate in numerous art performances, committees, and athletic events.

Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
This plan is shared with staff at the beginning of each school year. The safety plan includes disaster procedures and 
procedures for safe entry and exit of students. IHCS also implements specific safety policies outlined
 
within the Parent 
and Student Handbook. Such policies include procedures for serious disciplinary problems, child abuse reporting 
procedures, school dress codes, and/or school discipline policies. We update our school safety plan annually.
 
 
Environment
 
Th
e safety of students, staff, and property is a high priority. The campus is fully fenced and locked when school is not in 

sign in and 
out using the Raptor system.  The Raptor System improves school safety by verifying all persons entering the 
campus are authorized to do so. The office staff scan the identification card and once the visitor has been cleared, a badge 
with the name, picture
, and destination of the visitor will be printed for the visitor to wear while on campus.
 
 
Supervision
 
To further ensure students are safe at all times, Supervision Aides are assigned to outside areas before and after school, 
during recess and lunch, and during passing time between classes. Under the direction of the principal, school staff 
members implemen
t specific school
-
building security procedures. In addition, the District Safety Coordinator, supports 
schools by reviewing and disseminating safety requirements and information and coordinating safety
-
related services.
 
 
Disaster Preparedness
 
Fire drills a
re held monthly and earthquake drills are held at least four times a year. To promote the importance of 
earthquake preparedness, IHCS participates in the annual Great Shakeout. A disaster plan is in place and reviewed with 
the staff each year.

Title I
 
Title I funds are used to support effective, research
-
based educational strategies that close the achievement gap for 
students not meeting 
the state's challenging academic standards in English Language Arts and mathematics. Title I funds 
are distributed to schools with a minimum of 50% poverty on a per
-
pupil basis. Based on an analysis of student 
achievement data, Title I resources may be use
d for professional development, interventions, parental involvement, 
personalization and support for students with at
-
risk behaviors.
 
 
Title III
 
Title III funds assist English Learners (EL) in acquiring English fluency, gaining access to the curriculum, an
d achieving grade
-

To align with Perris Elementary School District expectations, IHCS supports the presence of student resources in the form 
of focus walls. Professional development includes presentations at the beginning of the year, during staff meetings, and a 
voluntary n
on
-
school day.  Administration and the academic coach also provides additional support and training to new 
teacher and returning teachers throughout school year to ensure implementation of purposeful focus walls to support 
student achievement.
 
 
Additional 
professional development is provided during staff meetings during the school year in order to continue to 
support the implementation of the California standards with an additional focus on California standards writing process.  
Evidence for professional de
velopment for instruction in writing was determined by the writing scores on district 
summative and state testing cluster data.  Administration and the academic coach provide continued support for 
implementation through demonstration lesson, lesson plannin
g, and collaborative conversations with teachers and grade 
level teams.
 
 

areas determined critical for teacher instructional success an
d student achievement success.  Trainings are scheduled once 
a month after school and support continues through grade level professional learning communities, lessons, and planning 
opportunities with academic coach.
