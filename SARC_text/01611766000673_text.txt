School Description
 
Welcome to James Leitch Elementary School, where we have made great progress toward enriching 
student learning and developing student potential. Our school is unique in being the only TK
-
2nd 
school in 
our district.  We also are privileged to have four Special Day Classes at our site.  Our 
parents are actively involved in our school, and the staff is collaborative in setting SMART goals, 
focusing on priority standards, and designing lessons/common assess
ments to promote student 
achievement. We were a California Distinguished School in 2010 and 2014, California Gold Ribbon 
School in 2016, and a National Blue Ribbon School in 2011.
 
 
School Vision:  James Leitch Elementary School is a safe, 
nurturing, and motivating educational 
environment where students, parents, and teachers form a community of life
-
long learners who 
will demonstrate a love for learning, strong self
-
esteem, and good citizenship.
 
 
School Mission:  Our mission at Leitch Eleme
ntary School is to work together both as Professional 
Learning Communities (PLCs) among school staff and with parents and students to ensure that all 
of our students are learning the high level of academic skills included within the California State 
Standa

-
rounded development so that they become 
independent, critical thinkers and respectful citizens.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accou
ntability 
Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California 
public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are 
required to prepare a Local Control a
nd Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reporte
d in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC 
web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LC
AP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact 
the school principal or the district 
office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textb
ooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for describes whether schools have enough books in core cla
sses for all students. The 
law also asks districts to reveal whether 
those books are presenting what the California Content Standards call for.
 
 
All of our textbooks are the most recently approved by the State Board of Education or our Local Governing Agency.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our classrooms were built in 1965.  Eleven new classrooms have been established on our campus since 1999.  We also added 9 ne
w portables in summer, 
2014.  Our classrooms are spacious and in fairly good
 
condition, and  wireless access is available at the entire school.  We have one day custodian and 
two full
-
time night custodians who clean our facilities on a daily basis.  Every kindergarten classroom has one restroom.  We also hav

three
 

 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Ins
pection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.  Based on that survey, we have answered the questi
ons you see on this 
report.  Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report.
 
Since that time, those conditions may have 
changed.

developed a new science 
assessment based on the Next Generation Science Standards for California

School Safety Plan
 
Staff and parent volunteers monitor students for 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after school as well as du
ring all recesses and lunchtime.  Visitors 
and volunteers are required to sign in at the office and obtain a visitor or volunteer badge.  Our custodians conduct a secur
ity check of the campus every 
morning and evening.  Teachers regularly review the rules 
for safe, responsible behavior in class and on the playground.  Students receive lessons 
designed to address the needs of our diverse population.  We want to ensure the emotional and physical safety of our students
.
 
 
We revise our Comprehensive Site Safety
 
Plan annually; the last update was in March 2019.  The safety plan includes procedures for emergencies, board 
policies related to student safety, evacuation routes, the chain of command, and goals for promoting campus and student safet
y.
 
 
Our Site Safety 
Committee reviews the plan annually and addresses any safety issues at our site.  Staff and parents notify administration of 
safety concerns 
immediately.  Custodial staff or district maintenance crews respond quickly to safety issues, and proper steps are 
taken to ensure student safety.  Teachers 
review the emergency procedures at the beginning of each school year.  We conduct monthly fire drills, and disaster drills oc
cur four times each year.  
Our district Risk Management Department and PTA prepare the in
ventories, and replace our classroom emergency packs and school
-
wide emergency 
supplies.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the subjects they teach. 
 
Below is the 
amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to budget cuts and related negotiations th
ese days are sometimes reduced.
