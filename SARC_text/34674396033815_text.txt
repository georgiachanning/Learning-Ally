School Description
 
Mission: Through the collaborative efforts of teachers, students, parents, and staff, Caleb 
Greenwood, An International Baccalaureate World School, provides a rigorous and balanced 
program of inquiry with a global perspective.
 
 
Vision: By providing an enga
ging and meaningful learning environment, we will foster a child's 
natural curiosity and desire to learn. We will focus on student achievement while embracing social 
emotional learning, critical thinking, international
-
mindedness, and reflection, to prepar
e students 
for success in college and their chosen careers.
 
 
The IB Primary Years Program prepares students to become active, caring, lifelong learners who 
demonstrate respect for themselves and others and have the capacity to participate in the world 
arou
nd them. The PYP is designed for students aged 3 to 12 and focuses on the development of the 
whole child as an inquirer, both in the classroom and in the world outside. The PYP framework is 
guided by six transdisciplinary themes of global significance and 
is delivered through site
-
developed 
curriculum based on national and local standards. IB Schools develop well
-
rounded students with 
character who respond to challenges with optimism and an open mind, are confident in their own 
identities, make ethical deci
sions, are globally aware and join with others in celebrating our 
common humanity, and are prepared to apply what they learn in real
-
world, complex and 
unpredictable situations. IB students are given a unique education experience that enables them 
to engag
e with people in an increasingly globalized, rapidly changing world and can lead them to 
some of the highest
-
ranking universities around the world. A vital element of an IB education is the 
transformative and ongoing professional development opportunities 
for educators. Each year, 
Caleb Greenwood, along with schools from all over the world, send groups of teachers to 
collaborative professional development sessions, in which teachers and school leaders work 
together to evaluate, reflect on, refine, and grow 
our program of inquiry.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Our high level of parent involvement is an integral part of our school community and positive school culture.  Our classrooms
 
have active parent 
volunteers present throughout the day, and our school garden and library
 
programs are run entirely by our parent and community volunteers.  We have 
an active PTSO, Parent Teacher Student Organization, that coordinates many parent volunteer opportunities, plans community
-
building events, and 
provides a wide variety of enrichmen
t programs for our students. Our Parent Resource Center located right next to the front office is a hub of activity 
where parents can receive important information, utilize resources, and network and plan together. If you would like informat

Professional 
Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professiona
l repertoire of its administrators and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction
, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local 
Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional p
ractices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outs
ide of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective sc
hools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
