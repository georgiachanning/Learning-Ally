School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
September 2018
 
 
Vallecito Union held a public hearing in November, 2019 and determined that each school within the district had sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to 
the settlement of Williams vs. 
the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks 
or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Te
xtbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all 
teache
rs and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays information ab

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hazel Fischer Elementary was originally 
constructed in 1973 and is comprised of 21 classrooms, one gym/ multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, one library, one staff lounge, one computer lab, and one playground along with an activity field. Cleaning 
Process: The principal works regularly with the custodia
l staff to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to 
provide for a clean and safe school. Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary 
to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in
 
a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and highest priority are given to emergency repairs. A general obligation school bond measure 
was passed in 2018 that will provide funding for repairs and upgrades to the existing a
nd aging infrastructure, including 
roof repairs and upgrades to the HVAC system.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pri
ority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and th
e 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with a
lternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirement
s for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

As a community 
focused school, we rely on parent volunteers, community members, and businesses to support students 
with more individual attention, small group activities, special programs, and financial support in equipment and supplies.  
Parents are involved in Parents 
Club, School Site Council, Adopt a Class, Library helpers, classroom volunteers, ski program, 
and special events. Partnerships have been established between Parents Club and local businesses and community 
organizations to leverage resources for students an
d the school. Parents are invited to participate in school and district 
committees, activities, and initiatives. Parent feedback about the school is elicited through the California Healthy Kids 
Parent Survey and other surveys pertinent to current issues.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Vallecito Union 
School District. The schools are always in 
compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Each 
School Site Safety plan is reviewed and updated annually. All revisions were communicated to 
both the classified and 

disaster. Many staff have received training in ALICE for how to respond to a variety of threats. Fire, evacuat
ion, and disaster 
drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills are held once a year. The school works 
with emergency responders including Ebbetts Pass Fire District and the Calaveras County Sheriff Office in planning 
and 
reporting. Students are supervised before and after school and at lunch by classified staff. There is a designated area for 
student drop off and pick up. Visitors must check in at the office. Communication tools and alternatives are identified and 
used
 
in the event of power outages or other scenarios that restrict traditional communication avenues.

Hazel Fischer Elementary School teachers have engaged in a number of professional development opportunities over the 
last few years. Most recently, teachers have received training in teaching the new California Common Core State Standards 
for Mathematics, English Language Arts, and the Next Generation Science Standards.  Teachers have used professional 
development time t
o develop and implement a multi tiered system of supports.  As the product of an MTSS grant for 2018
-
2020, the site has established an MTSS Leadership Team to guide processes and practices that seek to reach the continuum 
of students at Hazel Fischer Eleme
ntary. Trainings have taken place both as trainings on professional development days 
for all staff, as well as release days for specific subject area instructors.  As a leader in the use of educational technolo
gy, 
our teachers receive ongoing professional 
development in technology resources. Hazel Fischer Elementary School, as part 
of the Vallecito Union School District, provides staff with three full
-
day professional development days as part of the 
contractual work year. Each teacher receives on average, 3
 
additional days for subject
-
specific targeted professional 
development on release days.  Professional development is supported by ongoing discussion, coaching, data collection, 
and collaboration. The majority of faculty meeting time is aimed at profession
al development. Personal growth resources 
such as books and other publications are also provided to staff and discussed in faculty meetings.
