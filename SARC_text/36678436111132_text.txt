By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-
5. It is the only Redlands Unified School 
District s
chool in Loma Linda and is one of the largest elementary schools in the District with a student population of 
approximately 680 students. Loma Linda Medical Center acts as an international magnet for employees, medical students, 
and patients. The city of L
oma Linda lays claim to this renowned institution, as well as being one of the Top Ten places to 
live and thrive in the United States. As a result, our school is comprised of a richly diverse student population originating
 
from each U.S. region and almost 
thirty countries. 12% of the students speak English as a second language. Even though 
the school is located in an upper middle
-
class residential area, Bryn Mawr is a Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) school. 
This means that due to our high socially
-

and lunch under this program. 
 
 
The staff is comprised of 25 certificated general education classroom teachers, 1 enrichment teacher, 3.5 special education 
teachers,1 Speech teache
r and a part

seriousness of educating young people to be life
-
long learners and competitive in a global economy. Support staff coupled 
with the teaching staff (custodians, food serv
ice workers, secretaries, instructional assistants, teachers, etc.) partner with 
parents and our local community to provide quality, standards
-
based instruction for all students within an educational 
environment where caring for kids is paramount. All staf
f members recognize and model appropriate, dignity
-
building 
interactions with students. The students' academic and emotional development is the primary focus of our school as 
evidenced by our effective strategies, programs, and interventions. Students rece
ive character education through 
participation in the PeaceBuilder philosophies, and Bryn Mawr is a Leader in Me school, equipping our students with 
leadership habits to be "life
-
ready" and successful in whatever their endeavors. One needs only to walk the

December 2019
 
 
The California State Board of Education reviews elementary level textbooks and adopts those that meet standards defined 
in the State Frameworks. Textbooks are selected in the Redlan
ds Unified School District through a committee of teachers 
and administrators. All materials have been reviewed by teachers and administrators and pilot programs run at school 
sites prior to selection of each textbook. All core textbooks are State approved
 
and aligned to the State content standards. 
All students including English Learners are issued a Math, English, Science, and Social Studies State
-
adopted textbook to 
use in class and to take home to complete required homework assignments. Each year new co
nsumable materials are also 
supplied to all students.  Copies of student textbooks are available for parent review at the District Instructional Resource
 
Center.
 
 
Supplemental computer software programs that support the learning of state standards include 
Accelerated Reader 
(motivates reading), Rosetta Stone (ELL), TenMarks math program, and Mystery Science (NGSS
-
based science instruction 
and experimentation). PEP and Houghton Mifflin Early Literacy materials are used in our Reading Intervention Program.

Maintenance and Repairs 
 
When maintenance and repairs are needed, the site custodians are notified. If the repair cannot be made by the site 
c
ustodian, a work order is processed putting District maintenance staff in motion to make the necessary repairs. The 
District work order process ensures effective service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The 
governing board has ado
pted cleaning standards for all schools in RUSD. A summary of these standards is available at the 
school office, at the District Office, or at www.redlands.k12.ca.us. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to 
develop cleaning schedules to ensur
e a clean and safe school. School site custodians clean classrooms daily and the school 
district provides a grounds crew to maintain landscaping and lawns.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bryn Mawr School is very 
fortunate to have the active involvement and support of our parent community. Parent 
volunteers support the school program with their participation as members of the Parent Teacher Association, School Site 
Council, English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
, classroom helpers, and numerous family events and activities 
throughout the year.  such as Grandparents' Day celebration, Book Fairs, Winter Carnival, STEM Family Night, Valentine's 
Day dance, and Multicultural Day.  None of these activities would be pos
sible without the support of our parents and PTA.  
In addition, parents are also part of the site Safety Committee where parental perspectives on issues are used to develop 
plans for school safety practices and procedures.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Bryn Mawr School utilizes data from its California Safe School Assessment and suspension/expulsion reports to 
evaluate 
the current status of school crime. A Safe School Plan is adopted each school year and is reflective of the school's safety 
needs determined with the help of the school safety committee. The key components of Bryn Mawr's Safe School Plan 
include a
 
description of school discipline policies and procedures, dress code guidelines, suspension and expulsion policies, 
sexual harassment policies, child abuse reporting procedures, dangerous pupil notification, and disaster response 
procedures. To ensure stu
dent safety during arrival, campus monitors, teachers, and the principal supervise the school 
grounds including the bus drop
-
off area, cafeteria, and playground. All access gates are monitored by staff during arrival 
and dismissal.  During the school day a
ll campus access points to school grounds are locked with the exception of the front 
entrance, which is through the administration office. The front gate is closed during the school day, and signs are posted 
to advise all visitors that they must report to 
the administration office and may not be on school grounds unless they have 
a visitor's pass that has been processed through the Raptor Visitor Management System.  During the school day there is 
only one access point onto campus through the front office.  
After school, teachers supervise students by having a 
presence outside their doors. Duty assignments are given to teachers, campus monitors, and the Principal to supervise 
the bus loading area and pickup areas until all students have left the campus.  Than
ks to the passage of a recent bond 
measure Bryn Mawr has additional perimeter security fencing which ensures we have a secure campus, and enhances the 
safety of our staff and students during the school day.

Summary of Strengths Learning Environment
 
Staff and parents set high standards and expectations for student achievement and behavior. Students and staff are proud 
of their school. School wide recognition of student achievement and citizenship is provided so that each student has the 
opportunity to
 
be recognized for exemplary citizenship and achievement. Monthly awards assemblies, Shakey's Student 
of the Month program, attendance incentives, reading dog tags, field trips, family events, and positive reinforcement 
within classrooms all assist staff i
n recognizing students for good work or citizenship. All of this contributes to an 
outstanding learning environment where students want to attend. 
 
 
Heath and Wellness
 
Bryn Mawr School stresses both a healthy mind and a healthy body. Instruction in this ar
ea integrates many curricular 
areas. In addition to the district's curriculum goals, children apply knowledge that will enhance their quality of life by 
offering strategies for a healthy lifestyle with the such things as PE health curriculum, themed assemb
lies, healthy cafeteria 
food and a daily running club.
 
 
Literacy Instruction
 
Primary and Intermediate teachers have been trained in literacy strategies to help students become proficient readers 
and writers. Staff development in "Direct Interactive Instruc
tion", "Thinking Maps", and "Write from the Beginning" have 
empowered teachers to be more effective. It has been exciting to see the progress of students due to the intervention 
and hard work of teachers.
 
 
Class Size Reduction
 
Due to reduced state funding 
for public education, there has been a steady rise in class sizes. Class sizes for Kindergarten 
are 25 students on average (100 minutes with 12
-
13 students/100 minutes with an average of 25 students). In grades 1
-
3 
class sizes are also 25:1 on average, whi
le grades 4
-
5 pupil:teacher ratios continue to be 35:1.
 
 
Student Organization 
-
 
The Academic Organizer has made a tremendous difference in the ability of students to organize 
themselves to be successful. School wide implementation of the organization tenan
ts of the Academic Organizer has made 
this a very successful tool for improving student performance. Students in grades 3
-
5 also receive a printed agenda which 
has resource information, school rules, a calendar, and a character education curriculum.
 
 
Chall
enges and Critical Needs Teacher Training
 
There is a tremendous need to provide training for teachers and, in particular, new teachers in the areas of effective 
teaching and learning using research based strategies (differentiated and direct interactive te
aching), teaching to mastery, 
professional collaboration and the use of outcome data to guide instruction. The latest challenges are new standards 
(Common Core State and National Standards), new accountability systems, and unpredictable budgeting formulas.

Technology 
 
The staff at Bryn Mawr participates in technology training each year, ranging from PowerPoint, digital camera, Mimio, 
data analysis software, assessment software, and Internet resources such as Google Classroom and Google Drive. We 
believe 
that technology should enhance and facilitate student learning but can only be met if the teacher is well trained 
in its use.
 
 
Three Year Student Objectives 
 

 
Each Bryn Mawr will meet growth targets in reading, language, and mathematics based on the CA Asse
ssment 
of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) summative assessment.
 

 
Students will learn and practice the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People through the implementation of the 
school
-
wide Leader in Me system.
 

 
Most, if not all, students will be fluent 
readers at grade level by the exit of 1st grade.
 

 
Through the use of the Academic Organizer, all students will exit Bryn Mawr School with the organization skills 
necessary to be successful at middle and high schools.
 

 
Accelerated Reader Program strategies 
will be reviewed and realigned with the programs guidelines to better 
meet the needs of all students.
 

 
Thinking Maps and "Write from the Beginning" will be implemented as school wide strategies.
 

 
Bryn Mawr students will regularly apply wellness strategies to
 
create a healthier lifestyle that will enhance their 
overall quality of life.
 

 
At
-
risk students will receive interventions through a remedial program taught by staff and hourly support staff. 
Student progress will be monitored.

The Bryn Mawr staff is committed to continual improvement. The School
-
Based Coordinated Program, Title I, and Single 
School Plan budgets provide funds which enable 
teachers to attend workshops and conferences and receive training from 
trainers and coaches. Releasing teachers with substitute teachers, as well as using collaborative days and after school 
meetings are used to enable teachers to maintain our school wide 
writing program called "Write from the Beginning".  
Also, our school wide use of Thinking Maps strategies, which complement the writing program, is in full implementation 
at each grade level.  Seven staff members have been trained as trainers and serve as 
coaches and models for all teachers. 
Up to eight collaboration days (minimum days) are set aside throughout the year for Professional Learning Community 
activities.  In addition, teachers are provided district training for an average of 6 days during the s
chool year in English
-
Language Arts, math, and science.  Bryn Mawr staff have also made use of consultants from Solution Tree Inc and Leverage 
Learning to further develop the Professional Learning Community process for teacher collaboration.
