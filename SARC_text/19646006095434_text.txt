By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
School Description:
 
The Hermosa Beach City School Distri
ct (HBCSD) was established in 1904.  The district is located in the southwest portion 
of Los Angeles County and serves the community of Hermosa Beach.  The district serves approximately 1,350 students 
and is located on two sites. Hermosa Valley is located 
in the heart of the city along Valley Drive near Pier Avenue. Hermosa 
Valley School provides a comprehensive 4th
-
8th grade program that is focused on a vision of empowering our students to 
achieve and thrive through the lens of making connections.  Student
s are exposed to a variety of enrichment opportunities 
through Music, STEAM, Mindfulness, Garden/Nutrition, Physical Education, and a technology rich approach.  Teachers and 
students build relationships around purposeful curriculum and lessons using the re
ading and writing workshop model, 
cognitive guided approach to math instruction, understanding phenomena with hands on science, and interactive social 
studies instruction.
 
 
Making connections is fundamental at Hermosa Valley School so our students can thri
ve.  Music instruction creates human 
connection while stimulating brain development, teaching discipline and reliving stress. STEAM connects students to 
design thinking, real world problem solving, collaborative team work, and production for authentic audi
ences. 
Mindfulness increases focus, attention, self
-
control, classroom participation, compassion, and empathy. Students who are 
mindful are able to increase academic performance, resolve conflict, and improve overall well
-
being. The school garden 
provides 
a platform for students to become environmental stewards and responsible caretakers four our community 
within and outside of the school on a large and small scale.  The garden introduces students to tenets of a healthy lifestyle
 
and provides a real world, 
soil
-
rich, on
-
site laboratory for exploration.  Exercise and activity reduces health risks, improves 
cardiovascular health, maintains strong and healthy bodies and minds, and reduces anxiety among students. Valley 
students are encouraged to walk, bike, or 
scooter/skateboard to school and received instruction from dedicated physical 
education teachers.  Recess and lunch provide time for students to interact, play, engage, and be active. Students have 
access to one
-
to
-
one chromebooks in their classrooms where
 
they can research, record, document and share through 
Google Classrooms.  The enrichment opportunities coupled with instruction provides a balanced, unique, and connected 
approach for our students.
 
 
As part of a small school district, we enjoy a high leve
l of communication and collaboration throughout the district, school 
administration, students, teachers, parents, and local stakeholders.  Our community dedicates time and resources to help 
support the vision of the school and to demonstrate to their child
ren the importance of education and service.  Hermosa 
Valley provides a well designed, challenging environment for all students where they thrive.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
October 2019
 
 
Hermosa Beach City  School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that high quality, standards
-
based textbooks and 
materials are available for every student to support instructional programs in the schools. Prior to adoption, the Hermosa 
Beach City Sc
hool District conducts a thorough review of its curriculum to ensure that it is aligned with the California 
Standards for the Common Core. Under California law, the State Board of Education reviews K
-
8 textbooks and other 
instructional materials and then a
dopts those meeting specific quality standards. In the Hermosa Beach City School 
District, textbooks considered for adoption are carefully reviewed by a committee of teachers and administrators. The 
most promising programs are piloted using established cri
teria and guidelines. The recommended books are then 
approved by the Hermosa Beach City School District Board of Education. To receive State instructional funds, the Hermosa 
Beach City School District ensures that it has fully complied with the requirement
s of Education Code Section 60119. The 
District has also conducted an annual public hearing ensuring the sufficiency of instructional materials. Each school 
maintains a library/media center which is supported by District.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California
 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [
ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State St
andards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univer
sity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
