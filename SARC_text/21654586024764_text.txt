About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability o
f Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Curriculum development is a district
-
wide effort. Teachers and administrators from all subject areas form working committees to draft recommendations 
on instructional materials.
 
 
The California 
Department of Education has determined textbook selection and adoption schedules. The district follows the state schedule for
 
these 
adoptions and has purchased textbooks from the most recent state
-
approved lists. All approved instructional materials are al
igned with California content 
standards for core academic areas.
 
 
The Elementary School District Curriculum Advisory Council reviews curriculum recommendations and revisions materials utilize
d in the support of the 
instructional program. The Curriculum Cou
ncil recommendations are forwarded to the Board of Education for final approval. This is an ongoing process, 
assuring that all textbooks and instructional materials are systematically reviewed, updated, and supplemented.
 
 
This table shows some of the 
textbooks used with grade K

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
At Coleman School, the campus is orderly, and students feel safe at school. The 
school ensures that on
-
site supervision is provided for programs that 
take place before and after school. A city
-
run daycare center is on the campus for before and after school care on a fee basis. In coordination with Bay 
Area Community Resources and The 
City of San Rafael, we offer enrichment classes in dance, art, engineering, cooking, and technology. Some of these 
programs are fee
-
based, others are not.
 
 
District and school policy require that during the school day all guests to the campus check
-
in at t

them for all staff and students.
 
 
The physical quality of the school campus influences teaching and learning. All students and faculty have a reasonable amount
 
of classroom and open 

 

 
and 

d some of these funds 
are used to beautify the campus. A newly redesigned music room, mural in the library and organized art studio provide an insp
iring space for students 
and professionals alike.
 
 
Coleman School, established in 1909 and relocated to its c
urrent location in 1941, was completely rebuilt in 2005. The new Coleman School is an excellent 
example of a modern campus designed to promote high academic success. It includes 16 classrooms, a multipurpose building, a l
ibrary, a technology 
center, and st
udent services (administration) building. Classrooms are arranged in clusters by grade level, and covered walkways and lighti
ng provide a 
safe environment for students. Parents have also added landscaping and garden areas to enhance the campus. During the 
2007

The district strives to ensure th
at all schools are clean, safe, and functional. All bathrooms, classrooms, and offices are cleaned daily. Students are 
encouraged to help keep the campus clean by recycling. District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep 
the school i
n good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. An online maintenance order request process is used to ensure efficient s
ervice and that emergency 
repairs are given the highest priority.

to make an annual contribution to support capital improvement projects, including deferred maintenance projects.

support 21st century learning. Additional classrooms, labs and equipment are being built and improved to reduce 
overcrowding in our schools and to better meet the growing demand for hands

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smart
er Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Parent involvement is a vital component of the educational program at Coleman Elementary School. The San Rafael City Schools 
would not be what it is 
today without the contributions of countless family members who give their ti
me and expertise as volunteers and who share their varied resources to 
support the goals and aspirations of San Rafael schools.
 
 

s,
 
including PTO, SELAC, 

eering in classrooms.
 
 
The goals for each of these groups remain to build a strong community that works to s
upport each learner at Coleman. Parents are invited to campus in 
many informal ways. Parents can often be seen volunteering, present at our assemblies, working on gardening projects, engagin
g at informal coffee 
chats, and a variety of performances and spec
ial events as well as more formal events like back

to
-
school nights and parent education nights. Coleman 
remains focused on being as inclusive with all families as possible, always seeking new ways to engage families to support ou

School Safety Plan
 
Date Reviewed and Updated: September 2019
 
Date Discussed with School Faculty: October 9, 2019
 
 
Coleman Elementary School has a comprehensive school safety plan covering all aspects of 
planning for emergency response and student safety. This 
plan is based on and coordinated with the district and county emergency preparedness plans. The plan is reviewed with school 
staff at the start of the 
school year. The plan is updated annually to inc
rease preparedness for any emergency, including storms, fire, earthquake, or intruders on campus. The 
entire school staff received CPR  training and first aid 17
-
18, and 18
-
19 school years.  Emergency drills are scheduled once per month and include fire, 
i
ntruder and earthquake drills. The school also participates in an annual county
-
wide disaster preparedness drill.
 
 
Key elements included in the school safety plan include procedures to follow in emergencies, safety drills, supplies and loca
