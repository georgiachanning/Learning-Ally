School Description
 
Kimball School was built in 1941 on the west side of National City. It is surrounded by a community 
that is supportive of the success of our students. In 2012, Kimball School launched the first year of 
a 50:50 Dual Language Spanish and English Program. Our
 
expectation is to have our students 
reading, writing and speaking in both languages. Upon entering Kimball you will notice a welcoming 
atmosphere as well as an aesthetically pleasing building. There are hardwood floors in the main 
building and a state of 
the art kitchen. There are two separate playgrounds one for primary and 
upper grade students. The school currently has a population of 420 students. This school year we 
will promote our second cohort of students to the middle. This cohort has been in the d
ual language 
immersion program since first grade.
 
 

 
In a community of shared values, we the parents, staff, and community of Kimball School strive to 
create lifelong learners of high character who meet the district a
nd state standards through quality 
standards
-
based instruction. Our formal vision statement is One Child, Two Languages, A World of 
Possibilities. At Kimball, we believe that each individual child has unique talents, gifts, and needs. 
We strive to provide 
a rigorous educational experience in both English and Spanish. We believe 
that providing instruction in two languages builds metacognition on key concepts, allows 
transference of skills learned and lays the foundation for a long term academic future. We be
lieve 
that the possibilities for an ever
-
changing global society are limitless. We are preparing our children 
to thrive in a global economy.
 
 
Message from Principal, Luz Vicario
 
The teachers, staff, and parents of our school community believe that all stud
ents can be successful 
when provided a challenging, rigorous and engaging curriculum. Kimball School is committed to 
forging new pathways in education to create confident bilingual, bi
-
literate students, who will lead 
the way in developing a strong economi
c community. The Dual Language Program was established 
in 2012 and is offered to students of kindergarten through sixth
-
grade age. Other benefits include 
increased teacher capacity through high
-
quality, focused staff development and coaching, 
increasing in
structional capacity by developing collaborative practices focused on student 
achievement, access and strategic use of technology by all students to improve academic progress, 
and ongoing improvement of school facilities. In addition, we are committed to p
roviding academic 
support networks and intervention strategies so that all our students have an opportunity to 
succeed. While barriers to achievement still exist, we have achieved extraordinary success and 
continue persisting and persevering. As a communit
y of learners, we continuously investigate and 
implement best strategies on a school
-
wide basis to ensure our students achieve and succeed. We 
have received various awards for our outstanding programs and have been recognized by the 
Springboard Association
 
for our Best Practices.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Ongoing

The school is highly maintained with new paint, plants, flowers, grass and new playground equipment.
 
Major renovations occurred in 1987 and in 2001. The first major r
enovation in 1987 was a complete modernization of the existing facility and portable 
buildings. During this time one regular classroom was reconfigured into a kindergarten classroom to accommodate student growt
h. The second major 


talled 
blinds, new carpeting, and purchasing new furniture. In 2006, the hardwood floors in the main hallway, stage and cafeteria w
ere completely refurbished. 
Glass security doors were installed in the main entrance and a security gate was installed by the library to provide addition
al perimeter security. Kimball 
currently has 22 regular classrooms and 9 relocatable buildings.
 
 
During
 
the summer of 2016, Kimball's main buildings were refurbished and updated with modern air
-
conditioning and heating.  This work was made 
possible through Proposition N school bond funds that were approved by the citizens of National City in 2014. In 2017 t
he kitchen area in the auditorium 
received a major upgrade with a new tiled look. During the summer of 2019 the hallways in the main building were all upgraded
 
with vinyl tackboard, 
freshly painted and the floors were once again refurbished, giving the mai
n entrance to the building a very modern look.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensur
e efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.

We have made a conscientious effort to provide a clean and attractive campus. Students are encouraged to have pride in their 
school and keep the 
c
ampus clean. The District Governing Board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these 
standards is available at 
the school office or at the district maintenance office. The principal works daily with the custodial sta
ff and the custodial supervisor to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The Facilities Inspection Tool (FIT)
 
The FIT is used on a yearly basis to identify facility needs and repairs.  All items found in need of repair on the FIT a
re addressed.  Items that involve 
asphalt, roofing, flooring or painting are addressed through the District's deferred maintenance program.  All other items ar
e expedited into the National 
School District work order system and repaired by our maintenance d
epartment.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

During the 2019
-
2020 school year all teachers at Kimball School will receive approximately 30 hours of professional development in mathematic
s through 
the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This will be the 2nd year of this professiona
l development which will empower our teachers to 
deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the California Common Core Standards. The project includes hands
-
on, research
-
based professional 
development, standards
-
based curriculum guides and unit pl
ans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath 
adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education rese
archers. A focus on 
professional developm
ent around the area of mathematics and English language arts was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAASPP 
data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers have and will continue to receive in
-
depth professional development in the 
California ELA/ELD 
framework. The ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of En
glish language 
learners and the need for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed 
to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas 
of focus have been delivered through teacher release days, bi
-
weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock 
offerings and during individual teacher planning d
ays. Kimball Elementary, being a dual 
-
 
language immersion school has also received staff development 
on GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) in order to assist students in becoming bi
-
literate. With our new English Language Arts adoption, 
BENCHMARK/A
DELANTE all teachers continue to receive staff development in the implementation of all components of the materials. To suppo
rt daily, 
robust and rigorous reading, the National School District has adopted the American Reading Company 100 book libraries. Al
l teachers will receive staff 
development on best practices as we implement this reading program with our students. The American Reading Company will focus
 
on providing students 
with motivational reading materials at the students' independent reading abili
ties, set power goals and involve parents in ensuring that students are 
reading for at least :30 minutes per day. In addition to the staff development outlined, our district resource teachers will 
provide English language 
development academies to ensure th
at our English language learners will show positive growth in their language development skills. Our counselors have 
received training on the Sanford Harmony social
-
emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver thi
s curriculum 
in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received prof
essional development on 
how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavio
r interventions and supports to all students. All of our teachers 
have also received training on the de
-
escalation component of the Crisis Prevention Institute training.
