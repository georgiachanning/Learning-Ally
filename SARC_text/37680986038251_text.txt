Special Education/ISSSchool Accountability Report Card 
for School Year 2018-2019
Published in 2019-2020
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The 

SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 

each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 

(LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a 

Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they 

intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific 

activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported 

in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. . 
 For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC Web page at 
http://www.cde.

ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 

Web page at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 

community members should contact the school principal or the district 

office.
DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web 
page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional informa
-
tion about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the 

county, and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that 

provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school 

graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding 

English learners.
Internet AccessInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that 
are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the 

Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-

come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of 

operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 

on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 

and the ability to print documents.

Our school, in partnership with our children, employees, parents and community members is committed 
to universal student achievement.   
Vision:The Rose School community vision is for families, teachers, and staff to work together to provide a learning 
environment where all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential. 
A Message from the Principal . . .
Academic achievement and a collective commitment to a growth mindset are the focus for both staff and 
students at Rose School.  Our classified and certificated staff works collectively to create an environment that 
establishes high expectations for both student achievement and positive school behavior. 
Our staff continues to implement researched-based proven instructional strategies to meet the needs of each 
child. We believe that every child has a right to a quality education, and we are committed to providing it. We 

all share the goal of meeting the needs of our English Learners with the expectation of them becoming fluent 

English speakers, readers, and writers. We continue to build a strong home-school relationship, knowing there 

is a direct correlation between parent involvement and effective schools. We also encourage active participation 

by the community in our programs and activities.
