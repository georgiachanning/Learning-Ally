By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About Our School
 
The Palmdale Aerospace Academy is an independent public charter school with an emphasis in STEM Education. 
Internships, professional mentors, and community service opportunities enable our students to make 
connections with 
local industry professionals. Our students have the ability to take a STEM class every year as well as all required general 
education classes. The Palmdale Aerospace Academy is providing the education for the workforce of the 21st Century.
 
 
The Need: The Palmdale Aerospace Academy plays a vital role, and fills a critical need, in the Antelope Valley community. 
By 2022, America will need 2.3 million new scientists and engineers, including 1.2 million in the computer occupations and 
544,300 e
ngineers. Many of these are needed in the Antelope Valley if the region is to maintain the worldwide reputation 

there is also a need to increas
e the percentage of Antelope Valley youth, particularly from underrepresented populations, 
who go on to college and successful careers.
 
 
The Mission: The Palmdale Aerospace Academy prepares students for college and a wide variety of careers in the science 

Through an innovative combination of programs designed to boost life skills as well as academic success, we promise our 
students and our
 
community that every student who graduates will leave here with a clear college and/or career master 
plan.
 
 
The Vision: Within three to five years, Palmdale Aerospace Academy graduates will be successfully employed in a variety 
of science and technology f
ields as well as other fields of their choosing.
 
 
The Philosophy: At The Palmdale Aerospace Academy, we believe:
 

 
The Palmdale community has a responsibility to educate its young people in the best way possible.
 

 
Each student deserves the 
opportunity to design, create, and explore new ideas.
 

 
Students of all races, ethnicities, backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels deserve an equal opportunity to 
achieve academic and professional success.
 

 
All students, by the time they leave our school, shou
ld be critical thinkers and problem solvers, agile and 
adaptable collaborators, effective communicators, curious and imaginative thinkers, and college or career 
ready citizens.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

CEO coordinates support teams in the event of an emergency. Other elements of the Safety Plan include Discipline policies 
and practices that help to preserve a s

behavior and safety issues, and we make every effort to enforce these fairly and consistently. Students have access to a 
student handbook that describes behavior expectations 
and consequences.
 
 
We continue to work with community partners and critical staff stakeholders to make improvements to our Safety Plan.

TPAA embraces the philosophy of a professional learning community (PLC). The entire faculty body meets during the 
summer for at least one full week of collaborative training and regrouping every year. Much of the time during the summer 
institute is spent i
n review of progress and planning for the upcoming school year. To that end, each teacher is an integral 
part of this process. Every teacher is part of a content team that sets goals for the next year in their subject area. Each 
teacher is also a part of a
 
grade level team that establishes goals for their assigned grade level. These goals follow the 
SMART goal structure in that they are Strategic, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time
-
bound. Each team monitors 
their progress toward meeting their goals
