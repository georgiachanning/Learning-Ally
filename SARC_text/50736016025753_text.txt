School Description
 
Our mission is to value the unique and diverse needs of our students while holding high 
expectations for all so they can develop 
academically, intellectually, and socially. Our goal is to 
increase student achievement, support our dual language immersion strand, and provide all 
students opportunities to be successful in the 21st century.
 
 
What Makes Von Renner Unique:
 

 
Von Renner was 
established in 1960 and has been serving students of the Newman 
community for over 50 years.
 

 
Von Renner has a high percentage of students remain at the school throughout their K
-
5 elementary school experience.
 

 

ions of students and has resulted in 
parents trusting the staff and the school with their children.
 

 
Von Renner houses the District's Dual Language Immersion program.
 

 
Von Renner offers many services including GATE, Special Education, Behavioral 
Support, Soc
ial Skills, Counseling, and Speech services.
 

 
Von Renner has strong involvement from our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) which 
provides : family events, assemblies, and the annual harvest carnival.
 
The Von Renner Staff is committed to character education 
and excellence and it is our intent to 
encourage a community of lifelong learners who function responsibly, positively, and productively 
in society. As our dual language immersion strand, traditional strand, and special education strand 
work independently 
at times, it is our expectation that collaboration within cohorts, the full 
implementation of CCSS, the use of common best practices through the ICLE Framework, and 
cohesion among staff will contribute to one common goal: student growth and achievement.The
 
Von Renner staff teaches the whole child and an appreciation of the arts, specifically, art, music, 
and language, are deeply rooted in the culture at Von Renner.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publis
h a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a
 
Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent w
ith data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abou
t the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal 
or the 
district office.
