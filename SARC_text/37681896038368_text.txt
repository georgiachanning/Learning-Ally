School Description
 
The Lakeview Elementary School Community believes that students can reach their highest 
potential and become lifelong learners through a variety of challenging educational opportunities. 
Such opportunities include a rigorous standards
-
based curriculum, dif
ferentiated instruction, and 
visual and performing creative outlets. Our school continues to utilize technology as a tool which 
promotes critical thinking and discovery, and also makes learning more accessible to each student. 
Lakeview educators are commit
ted to growing professionally by learning about innovative 
classrooms and teaching practices. This allows our classrooms to exemplify best teaching practices. 
Lakeview School enjoys strong support from our parent community. Our teachers, parents, and 
staff
 
believe in supporting every student attending this school with the means necessary to ensure 
student success.  Lakeview enjoys a strong partnership with our Parent/Teacher Association.  The 
Lakeview PTA offers several fundraising opportunities throughout 
the year for the purpose of 
raising funds for the purpose of enhancing the educational experience for our students.  PTA funds 
provide transportation for students to attend off site educational field trips such as the Star of India, 
BizTown, the Marine Sci
ence Floating Lab, etc.  PTA also provides educational assemblies for 
students on topics such as Anti
-
Bullying, Red Ribbon Week, Science Exploration, Literacy, etc.  In 
addition, our PTA helps to supplement our educational program by providing classroom ma
terials 
& supplies, educational software and Physical Education equipment.
 
 

academic, physical and emotional needs. Our strong curricular program is a balance of 
basic skills 
instruction, critical
-
thinking activities, active participatory learning and challenging enrichment 
opportunities meeting all of the California Content Standards. Our utilization of technology is top 
notch, with a minimum of three online compu
ters in every classroom. Every student in grades 2, 3, 
4, and 5 has access to an individual iPad, pre
-
loaded with standards
-
based learning content. In the 
remaining grade levels, students have group sets of iPads to use during the academic day. We 
incorpor
ate Apple TV technology and curricular enhancements such as Google Classroom in grades 
K through 5.   Online programs allow us to implement an on
-

students. In addition, we offer 11 Spanish Immersion classes. These stu
dents are taught part of the 
day in Spanish, and part of the day in English. Students in our immersion program develop life
-
long 
advantages by becoming bilingual, bi
-
literate and culturally competent citizens.  We firmly believe 
in educating the whole stud
ent by offering Band and music to students in grades 2
-
5. All students 
in Grades K
-
5 receive the benefit of art instruction offered by trained art specialists through the Art 
Docent Program. District multiple measures are used to assess the academic progre
ss of each 
student several times yearly and gauge the overall strength of our academic program. 
 
District testing includes the Performance Assessment of Writing Skills, Reading Inventories,  (grades 
2

5), and the district adopted Reading Asses
sment (grades K
-
5).  Results of these assessments and 
more are shared with parents and used as ongoing assessments to modify instruction. Teachers 
meet weekly at Professional Learning Communities to design instruction to meet the needs of 
students based on
 
four primary questions: 1) What do we want our students to learn? 2) How will 

How will we respond when they already know it?

We use the previously mentioned data
 
as well as team designed formative assessment data to answer these questions and inform our 
instruction.  Lakeview Elementary School has adopted a Positive Behavior Interventions & Supports (PBIS) program as a means t
o provide 
a positive, safe and respect
ful environment for all members of the school community.  After
-
school enrichment programs for students 
include: aerobic dance, reading, math, music, and science classes, focusing on various topics, are offered throughout the sch
ool year. 
Leadership opport
unities are provided offering students in serving the school community through such means as Safety Patrol, Peace 
Patrol, and Lakeview Leadership.

About the SARC
 
By Febru
ary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fundi
ng Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state a
nd local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the sch
ool, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lakeview Elementary School opened in September of 1959. Some of our classrooms have been updated and maintained to provide a 
safe and stimulating 
learning environment. The Lakeside Unio
n School District team works diligently to ensure that all sites are well
-
maintained and undergo maintenance on 
a regular basis. An online system of work orders is implemented to assist in maintenance requests. Sites are cleaned, painted
 
and carpeted on a 
regular 
basis. Restrooms and fire alarms systems are also maintained and updated as necessary. Upgraded waterless urinals have been i

restrooms to provide sanitation and energy efficiency. Heating and cooling systems are regularly eval
uated to ensure energy efficient use. The passing 
of Proposition V by the Lakeside Community allowed our site to build a new Multi
-
purpose room and office space and teacher workroom. State of the 
art office spaces, including a health office, and food servi
ce area, provide an energy efficient, attractive and healthy environment for our students. In the 
summer of 2012, two very old classrooms were torn down and replaced with updated modular classrooms. The Kindergarten playgro
und was rearranged 
and improved f
or safety and efficiency. New play equipment was added on both the lower and upper playgrounds that meet safety requirements 
supported by the JPA. Our school site is cleaned daily and any graffiti removed immediately by custodial staff. Each and ever
y stud
ent takes pride in the 
appearance of their school and incentives are provided for campus beautification.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Fa
cilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.

the date of th

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district make
s to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 

y volunteers who regularly read and 
volunteer in classrooms and with school
-
wide activities demonstrate this strength. Ongoing home/school communication, including weekly email blasts 
relay school & community events and activities and important information
.  School and PTA newsletters empower parents and teachers to stay informed 

information daily.
 
 
Each teacher shares their instructi
onal program, classroom policies and procedures with parents at our "Back To School"  presentation in September. 
Additionally, parent/teacher conferences are held for every student each December and March. Open House, Family Lunch Day, Fi
eld Day, Science N
ights, 
The Father Daughter Dance, Founders Day Dinner, Mother/Son Day, Bicycle Rodeo, Book Fairs, Art Docent Programs, classroom per
formances, and the 
annual Fall Carnival,  provide numerous opportunities for parent involvement. Every grade level presents 
at least one special culminating instructional 
activity each year that encourages parent attendance.  Our annual holiday program highlights our music program.  Students in 
grades 2, 3, and 4 play 
instruments and perform holiday songs in both English and Sp
anish.
 
 
Parents also play a significant role in the life of the school community through their involvement in ongoing committee work 
including the Lakeview 
School Site Council, the District Advisory Council, the District English Learners Advisory Council, 
 
the Run for the Arts Committee, School Safety Committee, 
PTA, and the Festival of the Arts Committee. Lakeview parents are actively involved in our ongoing Art Docent Program that pl
aces trained parent 
volunteers in classrooms teaching specifically planne
d art lessons. Parents are trained on various technology
-
based programs such as Accelerated Reader,

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

icipate fully in society as adults. However, 
for education to be successful, we must provide a safe and secure learning community in which teachers can teach and children
 
can learn.  Lakeview 
Elementary School updated our School Safety Plan during the 2018
-
2019 school year and we continue to review and revise our plan annually.  This plan 
was reviewed and updated by the School Safety Committee with representatives from the staff, parents, community, local law en
forcement, and 
emergency service agencies. The
 
plan is based on the recommended safe school model, consisting of four interacting components encompassing the 
whole school environment, the effects of these four components on the school environment, and ways in which the components in
terrelate with othe
r 



 
 
The plan also includes various Lakeside Union School Dist
rict and Lakeview Elementary School policies and procedures relating to campus and community 
safety issues such as child abuse, disaster routines, dress code, school rules, sexual harassment and weapons on campus.  Tea
chers share important parts 
of this pl
an with students as appropriate.  Fire and various disaster drills are held monthly. The complete plan is on file in the scho
ol office and is reviewed 
with staff and our School Site Council annually. Quarterly Community Safety Meetings are held with repres

Department, Highway Patrol, Fire Department, and San Diego County to discuss safety issues for each of the sites. The school 
also received a "Safe Routes 
To School" grant in 2012, which provided the installation of 
sidewalks in our neighborhood in an effort to protect walking students and parents from 
moving vehicles.
 
 
Campus security and student safety is always a priority at Lakeview Elementary. We employ seven campus student supervisors an
d one playground 
coordina
tor for our lunchtime and recess, one additional duty during morning breakfast, and one student supervisor for our kindergart
en playground.  
Campus Student Supervisors have daily check
-
ins and monthly meetings to ensure that they have the appropriate train
ing and support they need to be 
confident with their duties. Walkie
-
talkies and ear pieces have been purchased so that playground supervisors and teachers are in constant 
communication with each other and the school office. Our Playground Coordinator takes
 
regular inventory and maintains playground equipment, and 
provide safe and fun activities for our students that teach cooperation skills and promote a healthy lifestyle.  All visitors
 
to our campus must register at 
the front desk by requesting a name tag 
from our IDENT
-
A
-
KID registration system.  Name tags, which are easily visible, are printed and a record of our 
visitors is kept secure.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Lakeview believes in making decisions for staff development based on multiple forms of  student achievement data.   A variety
 
of assessments including 
SBAC, district benchmarks, adopted curricular assessments, and site
-
based formative assessments have led 
Lakeview to pursue professional development 
in several areas.  All Lakeview teachers have received in
-
depth training in the area of mathematics from the Math Transformations team.  Teachers are 
also provided with release days to work in their grade level t
eams with a Math Transformations coach.  Lakeview teachers participated in an in
-
service 
series focused on the recently adopted common core aligned Language Arts curriculum, and common core mathematics in
-
service and coaching.  All 
grade
-
level teachers are
 
also scheduled to attend the Learning Headquarters Common Core aligned writing training. Lakeview benefits from regular 
coaching from technology integration specialists who are employed by the district.  Teachers have also attended technology
-
focused conf
erences such 
as the CUE.  Many teachers also augment the teaching of Science through their  participation in the development of the Next G
eneration Science 
Standards and the IDEAS grant. Immersion teachers have attended multiple conferences which focused o
n language acquisition. Staff members from

Mainstream, SDC, and RSP classes attended trainings which focused on inclusion and meeting the needs of all students.  Six me
mbers of the Lakeview 
staff also received multiple days of training on Positive Behavior
 
Intervention and Supports (PBIS.)  These teacher leaders then developed a program to 
train their colleagues.  This PBIS Team provides ongoing training for staff at monthly staff meetings.
 
 
Across the District:
 
 
SCIENCE 

 
 
The primary areas of focus for st
aff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) 
and moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus areas include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling
 
up Professiona
l Learning 
and Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Co
llaborative planning tools for 
instruction, and 5) Addressing supplemental instructional materials.
 
 
Professional develo
pment needs were determined via district
-
wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation 
Science Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedback data collected via prior professional learning events in the 
distri
ct.
 
 
Professional Learning for the 2018
-
2019 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued 
leadership, pedagogy, and content training.  This will occur primarily through science lesson study fo
r all TK
-
8 teachers of science to include MS ELA 
teachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.
 
 
Core Leadership Team and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training i
n the areas of Leadership, Facilitation of Professional Learning 
for their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation In
itiative Program.  

ers will be provided NGSS professional learning facilitated by their district Teacher Leader peers through 
the established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district PD days.
 
Other opportunities for science professional learning inclu
de supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional Environmental Education 
Community (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.
 
 
Administrator professional learning will address NGSS innovations, strategies to identify and s
upport high quality science instruction (observations and 
feedback) and sustainability.  This support will occur both on site and through district management meetings via the Early Im
plementer Initiative.
 
 
Next Generation Science Standards Teacher Leaders,
 
Expansion Teachers, and administrators are supported via NGSS Early Implementation Initiative 
Project Director, on
-
site Core Leadership Team members and/or Teacher Leaders.
 
 
MATH 

 
 
LUSD focused on mathematics as a professional development goal in 
response to low performance scores on the CAASPP and to support teachers in the 
Common Core Standards for Mathematics.
 
 
Professional development in mathematics is delivered in three primary ways:  1) Workshops (after school, on professional grow
th days, an
d during 
teacher release time), 2) Individual and small group site
-
based coaching/mentoring, and 3) Conference attendance.
 
 
Teachers are supported in refining their mathematics instruction and use of curriculum materials through: 1) Workshops focuse
d on th
e content and 
pedagogy relevant to the math content they teach, vertical progression of content, and the Common Core content and practice s
tandards 2) 
Workshops/guided collaboration focused on unit and lesson design with their curriculum materials (within 
school and cross
-
school), 3) In
-
class coaching 
both in one
-
on
-
one and small groups, and 4) Lesson Study in grade
-
level groups.  Additionally, principals attend all teacher professional learning activities 
and receive additional training from a leadership p
erspective.
 
 
 
Social/Emotional/Behavioral Support 
-
 
 
Social
-
emotional learning and support and behavioral support are focus areas in the 18
-
19 school year.
 
PBIS remains in place at all sites. School Counselors continue the work of supporting the social and
 
emotional needs of students.   Two Behavior Specialists 
and two Behavior Intervention Aides are also available to support students with the most intensive behavioral needs.  Two MTS
S Teachers on Special 
Assignment (TOSAs) were added to support the develop
ment of social/emotional/behavioral intervention systems at four of our Elementary sites.
 
 
Professional Development and Coaching have focused on Conscious Classroom Management strategies.  Conscious Classroom Teachin
g provides teachers 
with professional de
velopment and coaching on Tier I and II behavioral strategies.  MTSS TOSAs are also available to coach on classroom managemen
t 
strategies and student behavior plans.
 
 
Leadership 
-
 
 
Lakeside Union School District continues to support principal growth throug
h Professional Development and has deepened our support of teacher leaders 
in the 2018
-
2019 school year. Teacher leaders (Facilitators) from each site received training in mentoring and coaching as well as conten
t support in 
mathematics and 21st Century Le
arning. The Facilitators, in turn, provide on
-
site coaching to their respective staffs.

Types of Services Funded
 
Lakeview elementary school operates from several different financial categories. The largest group of monies at our school is
 
our LCFF funds. These are 
funds provided to schools by the state. These monies are used with input from the School Site Council fo
r supplies, equipment, programs,technologies, 
and professional development that are servicing the general population of students in a regular classroom setting.
 
 
Special funding from the state is also provided for specific groups of students. These monies 
are referred to as categorical funds and are designated to 
address a specific group of students with programs and instruction in addition to the instruction they receive during the cla
ssroom routine. Students 
learning English or who may represent a lower s
ocio
-
economic demographic may work with specialized curriculum, or receive additional learning time 
with materials and services provided by these funds.
 
 
To make comparisons possible across schools and districts of varying sizes, we first report our overal
l spending per student. We base our calculations on 
our average daily attendance (ADA).
 
 

ose. Restricted funds, 
however, must be sp
ent for specific purposes set out by legal requirements or the donor. Examples include funding for instructional materials, e
conomic 
impact aid, and teacher and principal training funds.
 
 
Next to the figures for the district and state averages, we show the
 

 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/

that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school g
raduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the I
nternet at 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of soft
ware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print 
documents.
