School Description
 
Taylor Street School is part of 
the Robla School District, which consists of five elementary schools 
and one preschool program, serving over 2,000 students. The district is located within the City of 
Sacramento, northeast of the central city. The Robla School District was originally esta
blished as 
the Oak Grove School District in the early 1890s. The district's name was changed to Robla School 
District in 1916. Robla is a derivative of the Spanish word "roble" which means "cluster of British 
Oak trees." During the past school year, Taylor
 
Street School served nearly 500 students in 
transitional kindergarten through sixth grade on a traditional schedule.
 
 

 
Taylor Street is a dynamic school which provides all of our students a variety of opportunities 
ranging from the 
Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program to targeted interventions groups 
throughout the year. Our goal is to help every student reach their highest academic potential. The 
English Language Development (ELD) program supports students who are multilingu
al and our 
Special Education program addresses various student needs in whole class and in small group 
settings. Taylor Street School offers enrichment programs for art, physical education, and 
technology classes to prepare students for the rising to 21st
-
century expectations. We are 
committed to the educational achievement of all our students and look to our parents to be active 
partners throughout the educational process. Opportunities for parent involvement include helping 
teachers in the classroom, prep
aring materials for class projects, school
-
wide activities, and 
chaperoning events. In addition, we have an English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School 
Site Council (SSC) for parents who want to be more involved in evaluating programs and take an 
active part of our school leadership.
 
 
Mission
 
The mission of the Robla School District is to provide a safe, caring and peaceful place where every 
student is enabled to succeed in learning a balanced core curriculum. Strong, effective teaching, 
meaningfu
l learning activities and partnerships with parents to develop confident, thoughtful and 
responsible citizens. Citizens, who can read, solve problems, access information and respect 
diversity so as to work together to communicate ideas in a changing, techn
ological society.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Unde
r the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific acti
vities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For 
additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

In the Robla School District, we believe in life
-
long learning, and all staff members in the 
district are given opportunities to continue their learning.  It 
does not matter how long you have been working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are s
till new skills to be learned.  
This is the concept behind profess
ional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School District.
 
 
Each year, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is sch
eduled on the day before the first 
d
ay of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The third day is scheduled 
at the end of the second 
trimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days in order to all
ow all staff to participate in learning activities.
 
 
For classified staff, the focus of these learning days is based upon the learning needs of each department in the school dist
rict.  Learning for custodians 
may focus on the correct use of new equipment t
hat has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Learning for kitchen staff may 
focus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their lea
rning on new office 
softw
are or on social
-
emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each department lead will consider the needs of t
he 
staff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  For example, all
 
staff members at all levels are being trained 
in appropriate response techniques in an active shooter situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a c
onsulting firm.  The training 
team then conducts training for different department s
taff members on different days during the school year, until all staff members have been trained.
 
 
For certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2
017
-
2018 on specific high impact
 
instructional practices.  The Robla School District, in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in Education (REEd)  Cente
r at the University of California 
at Davis, has defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These research
-
based pract
ices focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific 
student behaviors which increase active learning, language production and higher
-
level thinking in the classroom. Another area of focus is 
Social/Emotional Learning which provides specific strategies fo
r ensuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically and emotionally.
 
 
Professional Learning Support Teachers (PLSTs)then provide on
-
going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for 
implementation.  The PLSTs are c
lassroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and one at sixth grade, offer 
support in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as a 
substitute i
n a classroom to 
allow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has shown exemplary skill with a certain te
aching technique.  They 
might team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real
-
time as the lesson is 
taking place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels 
and all levels of experience.  A teacher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our p
rofessional learning.
 
 
PLSTs and Principals receive on
-
going tra
ining in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporting teachers.  
Special coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are 
then encouraged
 
to put 
them into practice.  Follow
-
up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and refine their skills.
 
 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  PLC train
ing was
 
provided to all teachers 
and administrators during the 2017
-
2018 school year.  Our system has been designed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.  
Classroom teachers meet in grade
-
level teams at their school on a weekly basis 
when their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.

In addition, District
-
wide PLC meetings are held once a trimester where all teachers at a grade level are able to meet together as a PLC focused on
 
the 
needs of that specific grade
 
level.  Principals and PLSTs also support this work as they provide coaching to PLC teams as needed or as requested.
 
 
Additional Professional Learning activities are offered to all staff after the end of the school day.  The focus of these tra
inings is ba
sed on the needs of 
staff.  Recent focus areas for teachers include technology in the classroom, social
-
emotional learning, and foundation skills in English Language Arts.  All 
staff members at all levels are also invited to Resilience training, which take
s place throughout the school year after school.  Resilience focuses on the 
relationships we have with the members of the community we serve with a special emphasis on cultural sensitivity.  This work 
is done in consultation 
with the Roberts Family Develop
ment Center and our Resilience consultant, Dr. Sara Truebridge.
