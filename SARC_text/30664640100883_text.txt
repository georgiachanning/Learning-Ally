By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Mission:
 
VdMES works collaboratively to support all stud
ent learning while building character in a safe, positive  environment.
 
 
Vision:
 
We believe that the most promising strategy for achieving the mission of Vista del Mar School is to function as a PLC.
 
 
Values:
 
We envision a school in which staff:
 
Demonstrat
es a personal commitment to the ongoing academic success and general well
-
being of every student.
 
Continually assesses individual student needs and abilities and makes modifications as needed.
 
Unites in collaborative teams to achieve common purposes and cl
ear goals.
 
Models integrity and treats every person with dignity and respect.
 
Presents a professional image that communicates commitment, compassion and confidence.
 
Strives to know all students as an individual.
 
 
Not far from the beach nestled in the 
hills of the quaint city of San Clemente, one will find Vista del Mar Elementary School, 
a truly unique school surrounded by the new community of Talega. The students who attend this school grow up together, 
eventually transitioning to the neighboring side
 
of our site: Vista del Mar Middle School. Vista del Mar Elementary School 
is home to 1100 kindergarten through fifth grade students, 40 highly qualified teachers, one principal, one assistant 
principal, and support staff.
 
 
The architecture and landscape b
lend well with the Mediterranean style that the community of Talega has adopted. 
Classrooms all have centrally located workrooms and pod learning areas that allow for individual and small group direct, 
targeted instruction and assessment. The back fields a
nd play areas are used not only by students, but also by after
-
school 
YMCA child care, after
-
hours enrichment classes, such as golf and tennis, and community sports teams.
 
 
Our facilities are home to parenting classes, adult community education classes, an
d after
-
school programs run by 
Saddleback College (Science, Physical Fitness, Music, and Arts) and San Clemente Park/Recreation Program GAP program 
(a supervised, activity driven daily group for siblings waiting for middle school dismissal).

Vista del Mar
 
Elementary School is a 2016 Gold Ribbon School, 2016 Honor Roll School, and 2014 Distinguished School 
because of our outstanding instruction and high expectations.  Our students thrive in a safe and secure environment in 
which they are encouraged to take 
chances to ensure that they meet or exceed expected growth in all physical, social, 
emotional, and academic arenas as reflected by our high academic scores on the California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress (CAASPP). The arts are enhanced by 
our PTA who provide parent volunteers to teach Meet the 
Masters art program, along with additional music programs for kindergarten through third grade along with our fourth 
and fifth music instruction twice a week. Thanks to the support of our district and
 
MAKO Foundation, our second through 
fifth grade students learn using technology throughout the day.  The Chromebooks allow students to go deeper into their 
learning, along with providing opportunities to collaborate, use their creativity and critical thin
king skills. In addition, the 
MAKO Foundation provides funding to provide exceptional learning opportunities for our students which includes a new 
writing program (Write from the Beginning and Beyond), PE equipment, music for K
-
3 grades, security cameras, 
and grants 
for our teachers.  Many safety net strategies are in place to address special needs and keep at
-
risk students from falling 
through the cracks. The staff is committed to the vision of our Professional Learning Community (PLC) and collaborates 
fai
thfully during Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence (ACE) time, lunches, and after hours to discuss the flexible 
grouping and ongoing assessments integral to the Response to Instruction and Intervention program (RTI), a 2005 Golden 
Bell award winn
ing program that is at the heart of the school. This collaborative environment not only fosters a readiness 
to learn but also ensures that our students learn more today than yesterday and more tomorrow than today, but also 
encourages growth for the practit
ioners through frequent professional development. Our PLC is united in establishing 
common purposes and clear goals as they model integrity and treats one another with respect and dignity.
 
 
The image displayed by our school embodies compassion, aptitude, a
nd ongoing commitment to enhancing the 
development of each student. A very active student council facilitates activities in conjunction with the Character Counts 
program designed to enhance positive character attributes in addition to promoting prideful sc
hool spirit. Awards 
assemblies, held at the end of each trimester, provide a venue for recognition of outstanding academic effort and progress, 
as well as a display of positive character attributes. The energy and enthusiasm found in all aspects of life at
 
Vista del Mar 
Elementary School is attributed to and nurtured by the strong partnership that exists between the community and school. 
Vista del Mar Elementary School, home of the Makos, is a Distinguished School where all students thrive.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the 
following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for stud
ents in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administra
tion of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

scores.

As a California 
Honor Roll School, California Gold Ribbon and Distinguished School, one of our Signature Practices is our 
extremely supportive parents. At Vista del Mar, parent participation is evidenced through a large volunteer program. 
Parents provide many volunteer ho
urs in the classrooms, assisting individual or small groups of children and doing clerical 
work for the classroom teacher. In addition, parents share their professional knowledge in art, physical fitness, medicine, 
and technology with our students. Our ver
y supportive Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and MAKO Foundation work 
hand
-
in
-
hand with the school and community to provide funds and programs, which further enrich the school experience 
for our students.  We also have enhanced our parent support through 
our Community Advisory Committee who 
collaborates monthly with administration and our PTA to ensure the voice of all students' needs are heard.
 
 
At the district level, the CUSD Foundation also provides resources and support to our schools.

Capistrano Unified School District places great value on the role of professional learning, and utilizes systems
-
wide 
structures and 
strategies to promote continuous learning of adults that result in increased learning for students.  The 
ongoing focus for professional learning is to support the district's Wildly Important Goal for Teaching and Learning.  It is 
the district goal to engag
e students in meaningful, challenging, and innovative educational experiences to increase post
-
secondary options for all students.
 
 
It is the goal of  Capistrano Unified School District to ensure all students receive Great First Instruction (GFI).  The vis
ion 
for GFI is that all learning environments include Lesson Preparation, Interaction, Strategies, and Review and Assessment 
as defined by the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP).  By design, the model for providing professional 
learning is m
ulti
-
tiered, and ranges from large
-
scale, district
-
wide learning opportunities focused on priority areas to site
-
specific, embedded professional learning (including coaching) that supports teachers in the transfer of that learning to the 
classroom. In addi

school hours to further support district initiatives and teacher needs for ongoing professional learning. The outcome of all 
CUSD professional learning is to 
improve educator effectiveness in order to increase student learning. In support of this 
outcome, administrators participate in professional learning to increase their knowledge of quality practices, California 
Content Standards, and strategies for instruc
tional leadership.
 
 
Since 2004, all schools provide specific release time for embedded professional learning using late start or early release 
days.  In grades K
-
8, this time is known as ACE time (Articulation and Collaboration for Excellence).  The purpos
e of this 
time is for educators to examine the impact of their practice on student learning, with a focus on continuous improvement.  
Schools work to identify key areas of learning based on an analysis of student data, upon which they place their focus for
 
professional learning and set annual measurable goals based upon those identified areas of need. These areas are 
determined through the analysis of student learning data from multiple sources, including, but not limited to high stakes 
testing. The action 
plan developed to accomplish these goals outlines priorities for teacher training and implementation.
 
 
Throughout the year, the structure of collaboration typically involves teacher teams engaging in ongoing examination of 
standards
-
based curriculum, the e
xamination of meaningful formative and summative assessment data, and powerful 
teaching strategies that get results in student learning. In 2017 the District developed the CUSD Professional Learning 

sional collaboration.  All collaborative teams utilize Common 
Goals, Relational Trust, Focus on Learning, Shared Responsibility, Action
-
Oriented, Data Driven, and Systems and 
Structures for Support  to ensure all students are learning at high levels.  Thes
e embedded professional learning activities 
help prepare teams to provide a differentiated instructional program that meets the needs of all students.
 
 
Beginning teachers receive systematic training and support during their first two years of teaching with
in the CUSD 
Induction Program. This program assists new teachers as they build upon the skills they already possess upon entering the 
field of teaching, and provides them with support from a veteran teacher. The program is approved by the California State 

to those activities previously described, all teachers may receive support, assistance, and opportunities to grow 
professionally through t
heir participation in school site learning teams, student study teams, from district resource 
teachers, and the Peer Assistance and Review Program.
