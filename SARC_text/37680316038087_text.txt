By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
One of four schools in the Coronado Unified School District, Silver Strand Elementary is located three miles south of the 
city of Coronado on a narrow peninsula between the Pacific Ocean and 
San Diego Bay.
 
 
Our student population draws from unique and diverse areas. The majority of our students reside in military housing that 
surrounds our school, with other students coming from our neighboring housing development, the Coronado Cays, and 
some 
students transfer in from within the Coronado district and from neighboring school districts.
 
 
Our school has completed several phases of renovation, including new buildings, paint, gardens, landscaping, playground 
improvements and upgraded technology in a
ll classrooms. A new play structure was added to the playground during the 
2016
-
17 school year.  Our library is filled with relevant and age
-
appropriate books and up
-
to
-
date reference materials.  
The exterior of the school was painted and gutters replaced 
in summer 2019.
 
 


commun
ity volunteers from across Coronado. Silver Strand Elementary benefits from an active PTO and School Site 
Council, providing weekly running and enrichment clubs (including golf, robotics, coding,  gardening, needlework, cooking, 
chess, yoga, and more), mon
thly extracurricular family activities, and traditions such as Holiday Shop and Luau. It is truly 
evident that parents and volunteers are not only welcomed, but embraced as educational partners and seen as invaluable 
resources to the children of Silver Str
and Elementary School.
 
 
Our instruction is influenced significantly by our site strategic planning goal areas of student achievement and 
development of multi
-
tiered systems of support. These goal areas are supported by cooperative funding between our PTO 
a
nd CSF (Coronado Schools Foundation) and allow all TK
-
5 students to have weekly VAPA (Visual and Performing Arts) and 
science "Innovation Lab" instruction.  Students have the opportunity to participate in both choral instruction and musical 
instrument inst
ruction via our school choir and  band programs.
 
 
We are pleased to have a Department of Defense grants that, in addition to other resources, provides extended small
-
group instruction for students in reading and math through our ASE (Academic 
Support and Enrichment) Program.  Our 
school also benefits from a grant partnering grade
-
level teachers with arts professionals to provide integrated cross
-
curricular arts lessons.
 
 
We have a number of after
-
school programs, and partnerships that 
focus support on our military families and students. 
These include Operation BIGs (emotional mentoring), our student
-
run Anchored4Life Club, and services provided by our 
School Liaison Officer and MFLC (Military Family Life Consultant).
 
 
In order to meet t
he needs of our youngest learners, we provide a state funded preschool for up to 24 three and four year 
old children in the morning and afternoon. Parent education, classroom volunteering, and articulation with our 
kindergarten teachers are integral to our
 
preschool program.  Our preschool is a Quality Preschool Initiative program.

A Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support model has also been implemented at Silver Strand, and we are in the 
process of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support.  Our c
ommunity agreements are based on "We are safe with our 
words and actions; we respect one another and our environment; and we are responsible for our learning and goals."  
Community agreements are reinforced in expectations assemblies at the beginning of th
e year, through Sanford Harmony 
curriculum and activities such as Morning Meet
-
Up and Buddy Ups, at our weekly Friday Flagpole assemblies, and through 
Voyager Crew Card incentives.
 
 
The camaraderie and close community of our small school is evident as the 
entire school and family and community 
representatives gather each Friday morning for our flagpole ceremony. All staff contribute to the well
-
being of each child 
in our school, and our active PTO sponsors many during and after
-
school events which enhance o
ur sense of "family." Our 
school schedule fosters grade
-
level planning and collaboration as well as weekly professional development for staff.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school safety plan is updated annually, and submitted early each fall for school board approval. Pertinent portions of 
the plan are reviewed with students early in the school year, and the plan is also reviewed with new staff members as 
soon
 
as they are hired.  A copy of the plan is also available for inspection by the public at each school site. Regularly 
scheduled drills regarding various types of potential emergencies (i.e.
-
fire, earthquake, lockdown, etc.) are held monthly 
with debriefing
 

 
 
To ensure safety during instructional hours, the perimeter gates of the site are locked immediately after entry each 
morning and reopened only at dismissal. Our front office 
door has an automatic locking device with remote control to 
ensure members of the public must be granted access to school before entering.  During school hours, all visitors are 
required to present an ID for processing via our Raptor System.  Additionally,
 
our Sonitrol system maintains alarmed 
security during non
-
school hours.  JPA Risk Management services via the San Diego County Office of Education and are a 
valuable resource for our site and district.  We have a strong partnership with the Coronado Polic
e Department and our 
School Resource Officers, with regular visits during Friday Flagpole assemblies and through instruction via the GREAT 
Program.
 
 
Playground supervisors receive training on safety procedures, regularly enforce playground expectations, an
d routinely 
trouble
-
shoot equipment and/or procedural issues. Our district maintenance and site custodial personnel routinely check 
all play equipment for safety and make recommendations for proactive maintenance.
 
 
All staff takes pride in our school 
and work together to maintain a well
-
kept facility. Regular maintenance is handled daily 
and emergencies are given immediate attention. Our district grounds crew is also here each week to maintain our grass 
and landscaped areas.
