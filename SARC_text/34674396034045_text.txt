positive social change in their community and the world.
 
 
Mission Statement:

become 
independent life

Rigorous and developmentally appropriate curriculum
 
GATE Cluster classes for 2nd through 6th grade
 
Safe learning community
 
 
John Bidwell 
Elementary has high expectations for students. Teachers work as a team to encourage 
students to be independent learners and use a variety of small group methods to develop problem
-
solving skills, cooperation, and higher
-
level thinking skills, instead of th
e standard textbook format. 
The staff works closely with parents and other community members to be responsive to the needs 
of students and the community.
 
 
School Description:
 
John Bidwell School is a school where unity and dedicated effort translate into h
igh student 
achievement.  Since 1998, when California began monitoring student achievement through 
Academic Performance Index (API) scores, our school has seen a steady increase of 276 API points, 
an achievement that has been recognized by Governor Davis, 
as well as officials from the United 
States Department of Education.
 
 
Our school has approximately 300 students in a pre
-
school through sixth grade program.  A morning 
and afternoon pre
-
school (Head Start and State) program is conducted on the campus.  Spe
cial 
education services are offered to identified students as well as a departmental program for our 
second through sixth graders.  We offer a 5 day a week after school program that features 
assistance with homework, recreational reading, and athletic acti
vities. Additionally, we have a 
state of the art computer lab; reading for pleasure room (Ben Carson Reading Room), acceleration 
classes in grades 4
-
6 (i.e. poetry, coding, financial literacy and math mindsets) and a Parent 
Resource Room.
 
 
We proudly provi
de all students with a rigorous curriculum, extensive interventions, a wide array 
of authentic assessment measures, individualized student action plans, and ongoing monitoring of 

ss: unity and purpose 
driven by a dedicated staff.  Our staff provides intensive and differentiated instruction, wins 
teaching honors, furthers their own education, conducts classroom action research, mentors new 
teachers, presents at local and national co
nferences, and are considered leaders in the district.

Our staff creates a collegial and supportive environment and works collaboratively in grade level teams, primary and intermed
iate 
segments, and various committees.  Through these collab
orative processes, we have built a strong system of peer recognition and 
celebration.  Teachers also collaborate to develop and provide Common Core State Standards aligned instruction. Intel is majo
r partner 
and has provided technological equipment as well
 
as ongoing for our children, families, and teachers.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card 
(SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan
 
(LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For m
ore information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF w
eb 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The district instructional material evaluation commi
ttee, consisted of members representing teachers, administrators, other staff, students, 
parents/guardians, and community, ensures that the selected textbooks, technology
-
based materials and other educational materials effectively support 
the district's ad
opted courses of study and meet current curricular goals and California Content Standards. Teachers, students, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members have the opportunity to review and provide input about the instructional materials being considered for a
doption. 
Recommendations for the adoption and/or withdrawal of instructional materials by the instructional material evaluation commit
tee are presented to 
the Board by the Superintendent or designee and include documentation supporting the recommendation. 
In some instances, the considered textbooks 
and/or instructional materials are piloted for a period of time before being recommended for adoption to the Board of Educati
on.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca

John Bidwell is committed to strong partnerships with parents and community. Parents are invited to participate as active mem
bers in our school 
community in many ways. We have several governing boards on site that are represented by parent
s, teachers and staff. These committees include 
School Site Council, English Language Advisory Committee and the Parent Teacher Family Organization. We have a growing number
 
of parents that attend 
these meetings as elected council members and/or diverse vo
ices in our school community. In 2015, we opened up the Bidwell Parent Resource Room 
which is equipped with computers, work stations, child care space and technology for presentations. An ongoing parent worksho
p series takes place in 
the Parent Room; which
 
unpacks the tools and resources available to ensure a quality learning experience for our children.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professional repertoire of its administrators 
and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Ling
uistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local Control Accountability Plan, and co
nnect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outside of contracted hours. In additio
n to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective schools focusing on deepening their c
ontent knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
