About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data re
ported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

dous products, sexual 
harassment policies, and the uniform complaint procedure.  Our School Safety plan outlines lockdown procedures, disaster resp

The school's most recent school safety plan was reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school staff and School Site Counci
