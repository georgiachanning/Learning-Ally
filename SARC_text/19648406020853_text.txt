School Description
 
Welcome to Chavez Elementary School, where learning is alive. We have an incredible campus that 
was built in 1923. Walking down the hallways you will see student work and pictures of student 
successes. A beautiful garden sits in the 
middle of our courtyard. We continue to make great 
progress toward enriching student learning through real
-
world experiences.
 
 
We are proud to say that we have high standards for all our students and our mission is to empower 
every student to high achievem
ent.   Students are assessed on a consistent basis and parents are 
provided progress reports on a regular basis. Students in Kindergarten through 5th grade take a 
diagnostic assessment three times a year.
 
 
Cesar Chavez Elementary  supports our districtwide
 
math initiative and teachers collaborate weekly 
to  provide our students the best instruction possible.  Students have access to the computers daily 
to work on their individual learning goals.   Students have free access to an online academic support 
comp
uter program (i
-
READY) in ELA and Math both at school and at home. Students are recognized 
every trimester with awards based on their academic progress.
 
 
We strongly believe in the importance of teaching students all the social skills needed to be 
emotionally healthy students.  Therefore, every classroom follows a social learning curriculum and  
we are a Playworks school. We have a full
-
time coach that teac
hes all of our students the Power of 
Play. We have a mentor program that allows older students work with younger students to support 
them in areas that they need help in.  We hold monthly student of the month assemblies that 
recognize students that are res
ponsible, safe and respectful.
 
 
We greatly value the support from our community . We keep our parents informed of their child's 
progress through our school
-
wide report cards and progress reports as needed. We include 
important information on our website an
d send flyers and calendars/events as needed.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

We have many ways for parents to participate in the life of our school, and we depend on parents to keep our programs running
 
smoothly. Parents can 
join our SSC (School Site Council), which works with administration to help ma
ke financial decisions. Parents of English Learners are vital to our ELAC 
(English Learner Advisory Committee) and to our outreach efforts on behalf of new families.
 
Parent volunteers help with special projects in the classroom and chaperone on field trips
.
 
The PTA sponsors student study trips and assemblies. Parents and volunteers are welcome to maintain our plants and flowers ar
ound the grounds with 
their children. We ask all parents to attend Back

School Safety Plan
 
Staff monitors the school grounds for 30 minutes before and 15 minutes after school as well as at all recesses a
nd at lunchtime. Playworks Site Coordinator 
trains peer tutors called Playworks Junior Coaches to promote a safe, positive playground environment. Teachers regularly rev
iew the rules for safe, 
responsible behavior in school and on the playground. We have a
 
closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the main 
door and sign in at the office, where they receive a visitor or volunteer badge to wear throughout their stay.

We revise our School Safety Plan annually. The plan includes
 
procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make 
the plan available on our school Web site and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan with all staff during 
a school
-
wide staff meeting. 
We practice f
ire and earthquake drills throughout the year and hold trainings for staff on emergency preparedness annually.
 
We are proud to offer Playworks at Chavez. Playworks is a highly regarded program to teach children the value of exercise and
 
playing well togeth
er. 
Playworks has been shown to dramatically increase quality time on learning, and dramatically reduce bullying. More informatio
n is available in our office 
or at the Playworks website: www.playworks.org.

Types of Services Funded
 
In response to the data collected, which includes SBAC,CELDT and NLMUSD Local Assessments, IEP Progress Reports, and i
-
Ready Diagnostic and 
Instruction Assessments, Behavioral Trends (office referrals, suspensions, teacher reports), we have created a plan 
to address the underlying challenges 
faced by families served by Cesar Chavez Elementary School.
 
 
RTI, Chavez has created a plan of tiered interventions at all grade levels to rapidly address the individual needs of all stu
dents. 100% of the students at 
Ch
avez will be taking the i
-
Ready Online Assessment and instruction. Teachers will group 100% of students according to their assessed strengths and 
challenges for small group instruction in ELA and Math. All students will be assigned a full instructional acc
ount for i
-
Ready and be given a minimum of 
30 minutes daily on the system, within their class small group instruction/intervention time. Students may also log in at hom
e or during ASES for additional 
time. Staff make themselves available to students before
 
or after school who do not have access at home, or simple choose to use this instructional 
resource. Students will be reassessed on a regular timetable and interventions adjusted accordingly. A math and reading tutor
 
supports all students that 
need the ex
tra support in phonics, reading comprehension and math.
 
 
Increasing the performance for students living in poverty. According to peer reviewed research cited in the goals of the SPSA
, students living in poverty 
improve their performance under specific comp
ensatory program of health, social/emotional well being, rich learning environments of arts, music, 
structured play and positive peer interactions all day. According to data on office referrals, suspensions, and the performan
ce of students living in povert
y 
on SBAC,ELPAC and NLMUSD Local Assessments, NLMUSD Benchmarks, i
-
ready Diagnostic and Instruction Assessments, Teacher and Parent input we 
have created programs specifically designed to meet the needs of all students living in poverty. Additional teacher
s and tutors have been hired and 
supported by the school and the district through the LEA plan. Playworks.org has created an environment of healthy, positive 
peer interventions and 
cooperative, exercise dense, brain challenging play. Playworks' mission her
e is to continue to concentrate efforts on fully integrating SWD systematically 
into the social and academic environment at Chavez. We plan to continue this program as a key part in the continuing growth i
n performance of our 
school and demographic groups.
 
As a result, the number of suspensions and office referrals has steadily decreased. Teachers report an increase of 10
-
15 
minutes per day of quality instructional time. Parents report that their students love school and are highly motivated to lea
rn. Inter
personal conflicts 
between students have decreased significantly. According to peer reviewed research cited in the goals of this SPSA, this is a
 
highly effective practice that 
leads to long term performance gains for schools and students as they advance th
rough school.
 
 
High Quality, Technology Enhanced ELD instruction for 100% of English Learners. Technology to enhance the performance of Engl
ish learners in the form 
of up to date computers, iPads, and in some classrooms, IWBs (Smart Boards) is purchased an
d maintained. Flat panel HD displays with wireless
