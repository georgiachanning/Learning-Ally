By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
October, 2019
 
 
San Lorenzo Valley Unified held a public hearing on October 17, 2019, and determined that each school within the distri
ct 
had sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
t
extbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted in cycles  aligned with  California Department of Education, making the textbooks 
used in the school
 
the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All 
recommended materials are available for
 
parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays 
information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional 
materials used at the school. We are currently considering
/piloting  a candidate  (FOSS) for science adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Boulder Creek Elementary School was originally constructed in 1868 and is currently comprised of 23 classrooms, 1 
multipurpose room/ cafeteria, 1 library, 1 science room, 1 staff loun
ge, 1 computer lab, and 2 playgrounds. Recently, a 
new playground structure was constructed on the lower playground. Additionally, a 3
-
room building was completed that 
includes a science lab, computer lab, and classroom. Air conditioning units were placed 
in the second
-
floor classrooms to 
ensure comfortable room temperatures.
 
 
Cleaning Process: The principal or designee works daily with the custodial staff of 2 (full
-
time) to ensure that the cleaning 
of the school is maintained to provide for a clean and sa
fe school. The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the repair
s necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and work orders are completed in a timely manner. An online work order process is used to ensure efficient service and 
the highest priority is given to emergency repairs.
 
 
The Facility Inspection Tool 
(FlT) was completed in April, 2019.
 
 
(Please note that all actions have been completed by the district maintenance office. The district has developed a plan to 
address the areas of need. All facilities are in compliance with Williams requirements and are s
afe for the student, staff 
and community use.)

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of San Lorenzo Valley Unified. In our annual Parent Survey, approximately 
94% of BCE parents responded that they are 
confident our school is physically and emotionally safe for their children. All 
schools in the district are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state 
earthquake standards. Sites work with the district a
nd county to ensure that there is a Safety Plan in place at each site.  
During the fall semester of the new school year, all annual revisions were communicated to both the classified and 
certificated staff. The school's disaster preparedness plan includes 
steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a 
disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Lockdown drills and training 
are held annually.
 
Students are supervised before and after school by certific
ated, classified, and/or administrative staff.  K 
-
 
5 students are 
supervised by classified staff at lunch; secondary students are supervised by certificated, classified and administrative sta
ff 
during their lunch. The site also shares the services of a Sa
fety Resource Officer (SRO) from the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's 
Department with the rest of the school sites in the district. At each school, there is a designated area for student drop off
 
and pick up. Visitors are required to check in at the front offic
e at each site.

SLVUSD is committed to "leading the learning" and 
provides multiple opportunities for professional development 
throughout the year.  We believe that the best professional development occurs when educators spend significant time 
collaborating around four essential questions:
 
1.
 
What do we want all students
 
to learn?
 
2.
 
How do we know if students learned?
 
3.
 

 
4.
 
How do we systematically respond when students already know the learning goals?
 
 
B
ecause we have aligned our vision on professional learning,
 
SLVUSD teachers and staff meet for an hour each week for 
grade level and/or department collaboration.   Educators analyze the results from student work and then determine 
instruction that will best meet the needs and strengths of students.  Sites use coll
aboration time to focus on their own 
professional learning as well.  Each site has a focus area for instructional improvement that is developed with the 
administrator and presented in the site plan and in teacher/administrator goals.
 
 
Throughout the year, t
he district also provides professional development in a variety of avenues.  Administrators meet 
regularly as an Administrative Council to learn with their colleagues about collaboration, instructional strategies and 
research and leadership.  Teacher leade
rs participate in district teams that focus on technology, instructional strategies, 
assessment, mathematics, English learners, gifted education and other key issues that improve classroom and school
-
wide 
learning for all students. SLVUSD staff participate
s in professional development days at the beginning of the school year 
and  throughout the school year.

For 2019
-
2020, the PD focus for our district began with Design Thinking as a model for collaborative problem solving. We 
continued our SEL focus with H
ealthy Kids survey data analysis and planning next steps. Our content focus PD is centered 
around mathematics this year with 2 full days of professional development provided by Dr. Nicki Newton. With her 
support, we are diving into the Math Workshop model 
as an instructional strategy to differentiate instruction and support 
all of our students as they work toward proficiency and beyond. In addition, We are continuing to provide PD in Readers 
and Writers Workshop with Momentum's PD offerings.
 
 
For 2018
-
2019,
 
the PD focus for our district continues the theme of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and student 
engagement. The district started the year with two PD days (August 15 and 16), bringing in outside experts in engaging 
and connecting with students. The PD da
y on October 19th continued this theme, and also added in work on the Next 
Generation Science Standards for elementary. The last PD day of the year, February 1, 2019, will focus on more NGSS 
work, student engagement and interdisciplinary teaming.
 
 
For 2017
-
2018 the PD focus for our four district PD days was social and emotional learning (SEL). We had two days in 
August focused around this theme (August 22 and August 23, 2017, and we had two more during the year on January 26, 
2018 and March 12, 2018). These
 
days allowed for professional speakers to come in and share resources and best practices 
with teachers, and we also build in time for collaboration and planning. We also held some after school sessions on SEL to 
support further PD for teachers.
 
 
Another P
D focus for 17
-
18 was reviewing grading and homework practices. Our District Curriculum Council (DCC) 
reviewed these issues and made plans for revising policy and practice. The DCC meetings are held during the school day, 
so teachers do have release time f
or these sessions. DCC is made up of administrators and teacher leaders.
 
 
PD Days in 15
-
16: 8/18/15, 8/19/15, 10/30/15, 1/29/16: Focus area was Writer's Workshop, CGI Math, AVID and data 
driven instruction.
 
 
PD Days in 16
-
17: 8/16/16, 8/17/16, 
10/10/16, 1/27/17: Focus area was instructional technology and data driven 
instruction.
 
 
Last we have district coaches who support our teachers in our areas of focus. Our two coaches this year are focused on 
SEL and data/assessment (PLCs, benchmark assessm
ents, reviewing data, etc.). These coaches support teachers in and out 
of the classroom.
