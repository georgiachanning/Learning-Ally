By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
 
Scott Lane Elementary School: Our Mission is to ensure the success of every scholar.
 
 
Scott Lane Elementary School has served its community since 1953. Scott Lane was built to provide school services to new 
families who moved to the Santa Clara Valley soon after World War II. Many new housing tracts were being built at that 
time, and the school was located in the center of these homes and close to the Santa Clara City Hall.
 
 
Scott Lane School is one of sevent
een elementary schools in the Santa Clara Unified School District, serving 491 students. 
The children and families at Scott Lane School speak over 15 languages. 75% are English Learners. At Scott Lane over 90% 
of the students participate in the Free/Reduce
d Lunch program. The student mobility rate is over 25%. Most of the 
students come from single parent families or families where both parents work. The community is socially, ethnically, and 
racially diverse.
 
 
Scott Lane has been able to combine the efforts
 
and talents from the students, staff, parents, and the community to 
produce an exemplary model of education. Scott Lane has an inclusion model for students with special needs in grades K
-
5.
 
 
Scott Lane also has a 40% PIP counselor. There is one full
-
time 
secretary and a part
-
time clerk. A day and night time 
custodian support Scott Lane School. Instructional assistants provide academic and language support for both students 
and parents. The classified staff are trained in instructional literacy techniques a
nd GLAD/SDAIE techniques as well as new 
methods for working with the Special Education population. Scott Lane students will be successful readers, writers, 
listeners, speakers, thinkers and communicators. They will be individuals who are respectful, make g
ood decisions and 
solve problems. Scott Lane students will be productive, resilient and responsible citizens who demonstrate an appreciation 
for their diverse community.
 
 
Scott Lane Elementary School continues to be a Program Improvement Year 4 
School in 20115
-
16. Our school was placed 
in Program Improvement because it did not achieve AYP in 2012
-
2013. The AYP area(s) that caused the PI identification in 
2012
-
 
2013 are English Language Arts and Mathematics.
 
 

eport may be obtained from the school or on the California Department of 
Education (CDE) AYP Web page at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/ay/.
 
 
All parents/guardians of students attending our school have the right to request a transfer of their child(ren) to a 
non
-
PI 
district school with district
-
paid transportation. For parents who select this option, the district will provide transportation 
to the non
-
PI school for as long as our school continues to be identified as a PI school. If the home school exits PI by 
making 
AYP for two consecutive years, the student can remain at the school; however, transportation will no longer be district
-
paid. If the demand for choice exceeds funds available, priority will be given to lowest achieving, low
-
income students.

Student
s from low
-
income families at our school, whose parents did not select a public school choice option, are eligible 
for free Supplemental Educational Services. These services are classes or tutoring which occur outside the regular school 
day with educationa
l providers approved by the State Board of Education. If the number of eligible students who apply 
for the SES program exceeds the financial resources available, the lowest achieving students from low
-
income families will 
receive SES first.
 
 
There are many
 
benefits to your child(ren) receiving free tutoring. Additional benefits are included below.
 

 
He/she receives specific help in English Language Arts, mathematics, and or science.
 

 
The tutoring is provided beyond the regular school day.
 

 
The tutoring is deliv
ered in a one

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) takes great e
fforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, SCUSD uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. The results of this
 

es department at (408) 423
-
2061.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
SCUSD 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in SCUSD, Board Policy 3514. The policy can be found 
online at www.santaclarausd.org/BoardPolicies. The principal works daily with the custodial staff to devel
op cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance
 
SCUSD participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program to assist school districts with expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of existing school building comp
onents. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Modernization Projects
 
SCUSD strives to be a model of financial responsibility, making every effort to spe
nd taxpayer dollars wisely. At the same 
time, ongoing bond programs are necessary in a district this large, with so many students, teachers, and facilities needs. 
Bond funds allow the District to maintain safe, modern school facilities and bring in updated
 
technology essential to 
student achievement. Measure B 1997 improvements included new elementary school play structures, new high school 
science classrooms and outdoor athletic facilities, the major renovation of eleven elementary schools, an ambitious ro
of 
replacement program, and two high school performing arts buildings. Measure J 2004 generated funds to modernize 
buildings and classrooms for middle schools, high schools, and the adult education campus. Measure H 2010 upgraded 
fire, safety and security 
systems, renovated and reopened a closed elementary school, installed solar panels to decrease 
energy costs, purchased the Agnews campus property, and expanded overcrowded schools. Measure H 2014 funds 
construction of three new schools on the Agnews campus
, expands overcrowded schools, and addresses critical facility 
needs such as replacing roofs and adding air conditioning to elementary school classrooms. Measure BB 2018 funds the 
construction of three new schools, reconstructs fields, replaces aging play 
structures and playground paving, adds shade 
structures, and upgrades fencing and gates, among many other crucial projects. More: www.santaclarausd.org/bond
 
 
Age of School Buildings
 
The main campus of Scott Lane School was built in 1959. Additions were mad
e in 1998 and portables added in 1997 for 
class size reduction. This school has 28 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library/media center and an administration 
building.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
All California public schools kindergarten and grades one through twelve must develop a comprehensive school safety 
plan, per California Education Code sections 32280
-
32289. School safety plans assess school climate and safety, identifying 
goals and action
s to improve safety and climate. The safety plan is written and developed with collaboration from 
students, parents, community, and law enforcement. It is reviewed and updated annually with the School Site Council 
(SSC).
 
 
We are committed to providing a sa
fe, responsible and respectful school environment for all students, staff, and 
community. We support and promote building a sense of community and belonging where every child feels included and 
valued, teaching children positive social skills and attitudes
 
including resolving conflicts without violence, and preparing 
for and responding appropriately to emergencies and disasters to keep children safe.
 
 
The school safety plan is available for review in the school office and was approved by the School Site Cou
ncil in 2019.

Staff development activities and expenditures are tied to District and school goals including the SPSA, WASC, LCAP, and 
District Strategic Plan. Staff development time continues to support teachers in self
-
reflection, analysis of student 
achievement data, 
and collaboration activities designed to help reach achievement goals. We believe in modeling lifelong 
learning for our students by engaging in collaborative sessions and professional development opportunities that align with 

School Plan
 
for S
tudent Achievement (SPSA) goals and support student achievement in content standards and 
Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). District and school staff development programs support meeting the 
academic, social, and emotional needs of all students 
by providing opportunities for teachers to advance their skills, 
develop teaching strategies, and create curriculum. During staff in
-
service days, teachers share information about 
instructional practices, cognitive development and learning disabilities, an
d best practices for English Language Learners. 
These presentations and workshops help us understand who our students are so we can better support them with 
individual counseling, curriculum design, and instructional practices.
 
 
There are four days dedicat
ed to professional development in the 2019
-
2020 school year. There were five days of 
professional development in the 2018
-
2019 school year, eight days of professional development in the 2017
-
2018 school 
year, and eight days of professional development in t
he 2016
-
2017 school year. In addition, there is professional 
development happening on the school campus through professional learning communities, where teachers meet to 
discuss best practices while assessing student work.
