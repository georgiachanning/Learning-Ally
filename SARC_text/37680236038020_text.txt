School Description
 
Valle Lindo is one of 49 schools in the the
 
Chula Vista Elementary School District, including charters. 
Valle Lindo offers a preschool to sixth grade program in both an English Only and Dual Language 
Immersion setting. We also offer a Special Day Class Mild
-
Moderate setting in preschool to sixth 
gr
ade. Our community encompasses two areas: the area immediately surrounding the school and 
the Vista Pacifica Community located about 3 miles from the school in the city of San Diego. 
Students from the Vista Pacifica community are transported daily by schoo
l bus. The current 
enrollment is 440 students, showing a slight decline in enrollment this school year.
 
 
A summary of our school data indicates that the student population is 76% Hispanic or Latino, 8% 
White, 7% Filipino, 5% African American and 1% 
Asian. 40% of our students participated in the 
National School Lunch Program. The English Learner population has remained steady at 36%. 24 of 
our 24 certificated classroom teachers are fully credentialed. This constitutes 100 percent NCLB 
compliant teache
rs. All staff members are CLAD or BCLAD certified. Our Dual Language staff 
includes 8 BCLAD teachers.
 
 
The Dual Language Program is offered from Kindergarten to Sixth grade and follows a 90:10 model 
in Grades K
-
3 and 50:50 in Grades 4
-
6. Currently, there a
re 7 Dual Lanugage classrooms with a total 
of 187 English Only and English Learners. We are presently transitioning to a late entry program up 
to 3rd if the students demonstrate proficiency in their L1.
 
 
There are 3 SDC Mild
-
Moderate classrooms for student
s in Grades K
-
6,  The school psychologist is 
on site for 5 days per week, along with a Student Support Assistant for 15 hours weekly. Services 
for Speech and Language are offered 5 days per week. School nurse services are provided on site 
for 2 days each w
eek.  Additionally the school employs a Behavior Specialist.
 
 
Mission
 
The Valle Lindo School Community truly believes that it takes a community to raise a child and that 
children come first at the center of every decision. We extend instructional impact to
 
parents 
through training in our ESLAC meetings as well as our quarterly parent meetings. When we have 
such an inclusive culture of learning focused on children, the school becomes an extension of their 
community and family. Students are then motivated to 
understand their world and seek to succeed 
at progressively higher levels of learning. A focus on research
-
based strategies and resources are 
used to address the diverse needs of our students. We review student progress through quarterly 
monitoring using c
urriculum
-
aligned assessments in language arts, math, ELD and science. Teachers 
meet regularly to review student work, identify instructional support and align resources. Students 
in need of intervention are identified early through the Student Success Tea
m process and receive 
necessary support. Parents are kept informed of school and individual student instructional targets 
and provided resources to help them support the focus.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to
 
publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pr
epare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consi
stent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and

Note: Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students w
ho met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is
 
too small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that w
as used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students 
who received scores.

Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective schools, and at Valle L
indo we encourage parents to become actively 
involved in our school.  Throughout the year we hold Parent Information Nights to keep parents informed about assessment, cur
riculum and instruction, 
and we provide workshops with strategies in which they can be
come partners with us in the education of their children.
 
 
Activities that parents can be a part of include the PTO, School Site Council, English/Spanish Language Advisory Committee, D
ual Immersion Parent 
Trainings, and quarterly parent meetings. The PTO s
ponsors many activities for families, such as a Back to School Beach Party, Fall Festival, Family Fun

School Safety Plan
 
Our school safety plan is rooted in the ideals of respect, responsibility and safety. The latest school. safety plan was appr
oved by our School Site Council 
on October 2018. We have implement
ed a Response to Intervention program for behavior which includes tiered support for students in the area of 
behavior. We are also a demonstration school for the Social Emotional Learning Program of Sanford Harmony. Our entire school 
is committed to 
promot
ing positive behaviors. Fire drills are conducted once per month and 4 annual earthquake preparedness drills are held. Lock
-
down drills and other 
emergency preparedness activities are planned each year. All our students particpate in the iSafe curriculum w
here they learn about safety online. There 
is a Crisis Response Team assigned to assist in emergency situations. Guidance Groups are scheduled under the direction of th
e school psychologist and 
Student Support Staff. Our school is enclosed completely by a 
perimeter fence. This safety feature ensures that all visitors must pass through the office 
and sign in before going to any location in the school. Playground safety is also a concern at Valle Lindo. We have a Safety 
Patrol at Valle Lindo who 
monitor and g
uide the flow of traffic in the mornings and afternoons. They are supported by their teacher sponsor and designated staff mem
bers. We 
have a Peace Patrol at Valle Lindo that assists to supervise games and activities for the students, promotes healthful pla
y, teamwork, and sportsmanship. 
Additionally, adult supervisors have been trained in conflict resolution to help support the students during recess.

Number of school days 
dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Each year, targeted professional improvement activities are provided for teachers, instructional aides, and other employees. 
 
Activities reflect the school's 
goals and objectives and are 
part of our School Single Site Plan. This year we are focusing on Developing Language Through Collaborative Discourse as 
well as Teacher Clarity in the instructional areas of Reading, Writing, and Math. The former was selected because our scores 
indicated 
a need to focus 
on ELLs, and the latter was selected from the Hattie Fischer Matrix of levels of instructional impact.
 
 
In the 2018
-
19 school year, we have added data analysis and small group planning to drive our professional development needs. Data gathe
ring points 
are from Benchmark Advance, ILE, Smarty Ants, Achieve 3000 in English and Spanish, and Next Gen Math.  Using data teachers cr
eate small groups and 
goals to address student needs. We streamlined our SST process into collaboration time for each g
rade level and are presently using our streamlined 
system to engage quarterly monitoring and further train the teachers in student interventions,. .
 
 
Our professional development stems from our Site Plan focus and our ILT Workshops, and is brokered by memb
ers of the ILT for the staff on Friday PD 
and Staff Meeting Days which are framed by the Union Contract.  We also offer teachers in DI and Combo classes two days to ea
ch group for planning 
time (total of 4 additional planning days).
