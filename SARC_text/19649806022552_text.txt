Franklin School maintains a staff of 31 credentialed general education classroom teachers, four special
-
education teachers and an 
additional Â½ t
ime SAI teacher. Additionally, there is a full
-
time equivalent literacy coach on staff and part time language and literacy 
teacher. Six of these 36 teachers have received National Board Certification. This highly qualified group of educators also i
ncludes 
15 
instructional assistants, a school psychologist, 1 full time speech pathologist and 2 part time speech pathologists, an occup
ational 
therapist, eight lunchtime activity leaders, 11 paraprofessionals, and three physical
-
education specialists. Our classif
ied staff includes 
office professionals, a library specialist, two health aides, and custodial and cafeteria workers. SMMUSD offers before schoo
l care for 
kindergarten through 5th grade students through School
-
Aged Programs. School
-
 
Aged Programs  offers a
fter school care for students in 
kindergarten through 3rd grade. In addition, we offer, in conjunction with the City of Santa Monica, an after school child
-
care program 
(CREST). Sports programs and enrichment after school classes are offered through CREST.
 
 
Franklin School has an active Parent Teacher Association (PTA), Special Education Parent Teacher Association, as well as an e
nthusiastic 
volunteer program.  Parents support every aspect of our educational program and provide generous funding for many sch
ool
-
wide 
enhancements. Our Site Governance Council meets regularly with a membership that includes 24 parents, teachers, and support s
taff. 
Our parents are active in assisting in our classrooms and on the playground as well as assisting in developing and m
aintaining our anti

Franklin is dedicated to being an eco
-
friendly school. Franklin Elementary has reduced our lunchtime trash from 22 bags per day to two 
bags per day. We now divert 3,600 bags of lunchtime trash from the landfill each y
ear! We accomplished this by using a sorting system 
that separates our liquids, recyclables, landfill waste and compostable food trays. We recently purchased new sorting station
s in order to 
expand our composting and make sure bins are clearly identifiable
.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accounta
bility Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
i
n the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should cont
act the school principal or the district office.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district make
s to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The Franklin PTA supports a variety of committees that parents volunteer to serve on. Several examples inc
lude our annual Halloween Carnival, Family 
Fun Nights, a Multicultural Committee, Science Club, Annual Fund, Green Team, daily art and table
-
top activities on the playground, and School Climate/ 
Safety Committees. The Safety Committee focuses on values, sa
fety, anti
-
bullying programs, Restorative Justice, educational game supervision, and 
community service. Many parents volunteer in classrooms, the library, and assist with lunch supervision. Other ways to volunt
eer include planning and/or 
participating in o
ur Parent Education group and Special Education group, serving as room parents,  leading Kindergarten Round
-
up tour and new parent 
tours, participating in Gardening Angels, attending disaster preparation activities, partnering with the community on charita
ble fundraising efforts, 
planning Red Ribbon Week, and sorting the items in Lost and Found, just to name a few. We also have a Franklin Care Corps whe
re parents supervise 
outdoor activities such as art, blocks, and games for students who want alternate act
ivities to participate in.
 
 
Parents and the community are informed about all Franklin School events through the once
-
a
-
week newsletter that is published by the Franklin 
Administration. Weekly email informational email blasts, Blackboard Connect, and our el
ectronic school marquee are all used to facilitate effective 
communication. Parents are given a master calendar of events at the beginning of the school year, and this information is als
o posted on our website. 
We have several enclosed cases and bulletin b
oards around school which house important and upcoming information. Franklin provides parent education 
opportunities several times a year. Speakers provide information to parents about topics relevant to the community. These mee
tings are very well 
attended
 
and are planned in response to parent concerns and interests. We have a group for parents of students with special needs. Thi
s group works in 
conjunction with the parent education group to bring speakers to school in order to provide information that can 
help parents of students who may need 
more assistance. Parents throughout SMMUSD are invited to attend the meetings. Our ELAC meetings help parents of English Lang
uage Learners become 
more involved as well. Our bilingual community liaison conducts parent o
utreach activities and a School Smarts program.
 
 
For more information on how to become involved at the school, please contact our PTA president at franklinpresidentpta@gmail.
com . We have a 
Franklin Facebook page and Twitter is used as well.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 

fety plan was conducted in August of 2018. The plan is shared with the parents in newsletters, first day packets, and 
at Site Council meetings at the beginning of the school year. Daily supervision begins at 8:00 a.m., gates are locked by 8:30
 
a.m., and un
locked at 2:40 
p.m. We have implemented a new safety policy where parents drop their children off at one of three entrances manned by a staf
f member. In the 
afternoon, parents are allowed on the playground to meet their children, but the interior of the sc
hool is locked until 3pm. During the school day the 
only access to the campus is through the front door. All visitors are required to sign in, be buzzed through our security doo
r, and wear a badge while on 
campus. Safety is a priority at Franklin. In the p
ast, our school has been recognized by the National PTA and received their National Award for Safety, 
First Place or Honorable Mention. There is yard supervision at all recesses and lunch breaks. Yard supervisors wear bright
-
colored orange vests for 
increa
sed visibility by the students. Parents who volunteer at recesses wear orange vests as well. Franklin implements the Olweus B
ullying Prevention 
Program school
-
wide. A new team was trained in October of 2017 in Olweus.  During the school day the physical
-
ed
ucation specialists are on the 

rized access to the school 
campus. Franklin is the one of largest elementary schools in SMMUSD, but 
maintains a small school feel with personalized attention.
 
 
We have a safety committee that continually reviews our anti
-
bullying policies, Restorative Justice, disaster preparedness, and disaster supplies. Monthly 
drills are conducted as well as participating in The Great California ShakeOut. All stakeholders are 
invited to provide feedback on drills. Franklin has a 
disaster bin with supplies needed in case of an emergency. Each classroom is equipped with a portable toilet, food, water, an
d other supplies that may 
be needed in case students and adults cannot vacate
 
the classrooms. Each staff member is provided with a copy of the safety plan and understands his 
or her role in a disaster or crisis situation. Substitute teachers are left with a disaster summary. Parents are informed of 
emergency procedures in ongoing 
a
rticles in the school newsletter and e
-
blasts.
 
 
Each student is trained in the definition of bullying. The definition is also printed in the student handbook. During the fir
st three weeks of school, each 
child is trained in the school rules as well as what
 
bullying is, and what to do in the case of bullying. Students are rewarded for positive behavior with 
yellow slips (caught demonstrating Franklin values) and purple slips (intervening in a potential bullying situation by tellin
g an adult at home and at sc
hool, 
helping remove the student victim from the situation, or standing up to the bully). Students take an anti
-
bullying pledge as well. Franklin has a merit 
program. If students keep 90
-
100 merits during a 12
-
15 week period, they are rewarded first with a
 

-
shirt and then other 
rewards. All employed adults on campus wear orange vests during recesses to ensure that they are visible as well as to preven
t situations. Anti
-
bullying 
policies are reinforced through Student Commit
tee assemblies, classroom meetings, and DARE instruction.Franklin's Emergency Safety Plan is updated 
each year in August and September and are submitted to the SMMUSD Board at the end of January.

Franklin teachers have chosen to focus on written language and mathematics for this school year. Data was used in order to de
termine areas that could 
be improved. Because students must justify their thinking in writing in all subjects, the teachers believe
 
writing is an essential skill. Three years ago, 
teachers chose to engage in lesson studies with a trainer from Write From the Beginning, the writing program provided by Thin
king Maps. Consequently, 
each grade level worked with a consultant from WFTB for 2
 
hours a day over a three day period. During that training, the grade level chose a lesson they 
would like to see, taught the lesson in one classroom, used the rubrics to score the finished products, and then determined n
ext steps. This was done 
twice over
 
the school year. This year, 2018
-
2019, teachers, within their PLC's, have developed common assessments to evaluate writing. A baseline 
writing assessment was completed at the beginning of the year so teachers can determine growth. There will be two writin
g pieces for each genre within 
each student portfolio that will kept with the student throughout their time at Franklin. The staff meets twice per month in 
their grade level or multi
-
grade level PLC. During this time, teachers review data, co
-
plan, and bra
instorm ideas to assist students. The site leadership team meets one time a 
month. During the meeting, these grade level representatives along with specialists and the Literacy Coach determine what typ
e of professional 
development the teachers would benefi
t for that month. The team plans the professional development and works with staff to determine who will 
deliver the PD to the teachers. 
 
 
In mathematics, Teachers are focusing on unpacking problems. Cognitively Guided Instruction will continue to be the f
ocus in math with assistance from 
the Math Leaders and district math trainer. Teachers are developing monthly math problems to provide to students and then dis
cussing student progress 
at grade
-
level and cross
-
grade level PLC meetings. At every all
-
staff PL
C meeting, there is a math minute where the math coaches share a new approach 
or a lesson that can easily be implemented in the classroom. The math leaders also attend grade level PLC meetings to provide
 
guidance to each grade 
level on lesson planning, dat
a review, and differentiation.

Types of Services Funded
 
High Achieving students receive differentiation within the general education classrooms. Many of our teachers have received t
raining in depth and 
complexity. Further, our Literacy Coach assists teachers in developing lessons that meet the needs of the enti
re class and provide opportunities for 
students to be challenged within the classroom. Franklin employs science specialists for kindergarten through 5th grade. The 
specialists work with each 
of our classes for 10 weeks. They focus on hands
-
on experiments a
nd explorations that further enhance student understanding and mastery of the state 
science standards. This program is funded by the our Santa Monica
-
Malibu Education Foundation (SMMEF) stretch grant.
 
 
Franklin offers a Lexia Reading, Success Maker Reading
, Tumble Books,Accelerated Reader and Math, Newela, and Reflex Math computer programs in 
the classroom and at home. We also offer targeted before school intervention in reading for small groups. During the school d
ay, students who require 
Tier III interven
tion are assisted in many ways. In third through fifth grade, a Literacy Interventionist works directly with students. She al
so assist students 
who are English Language Leaners and require assistance with acquiring language skills. Our instructional assist
ants are trained in supplemental programs 
to assist students who require support within the classrooms. Our teachers are using Thinking Maps, Write From The Beginning 
and Beyond as well as 
many use Reader's and Writer's Workshop to assist Tier III students
. Many teachers are trained in Words Their Way, Haggarty, and other phonics and 
phonemic awareness curriculums. Our Literacy Coach helps coach teachers in their own classrooms.Furthermore, SMMUSD uses Titl
e II funds to support 
a Math and Secondary Support 
Coordinator to:
 

 
work with teachers/administrators to support student learning around math content and practices for all students
 

 
facilitate and review the guaranteed and viable curriculum that includes use of common formative assessments to gauge student
 
a
chievement
