About the SARC
 
By Feb
ruary 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Fun
ding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state
 
and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety Plan
 
The comprehensive School Safety Plan includes, but is not necessarily limited to, assessing the current 
status of school crime committed on school 
campuses and at school related functions, identifying appropriate strategies and programs that will provide or maintain a hig
h level of school safety, and 
addressing procedures for complying with existing laws rel
ated to school safety.
 
 
Fire drills are held at least twice a year at the secondary schools and once a month at the elementary schools. Disaster and 
earthquake drills are conducted 
as needed. The School Safety Plan also includes the MVUSD discipline policy
, which describes the consequences for student misconduct (such as 
detention, Saturday School, suspension, and expulsion).
 
 
The School Safety Plan is reviewed, updated, and discussed with all school staff annually. The School Safety Plan was discuss
ed with
 
staff on December 
13, 2019.  Students are instructed on the plan annually during the instruction of school routines and expectations.
