About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The involvement of parents and community members is an essential component of nurturing students at Rose Avenue. Every effort
 
is made to invite 
parents and the community to provide input en
suring the success of our students.  A team of parents, teachers and administrator developed the 
school/parent/community involvement policy. We involve and inform all stakeholders in a variety of ways.There are several par
ent meetings, such as 
School Site 
Council, English Learner Advisory Council, Title 1 Meetings, and "Coffee with the Principal", during which parents receive in
formation and 
have input into critical decisions. Our school website, Twitter and Facebook sites are constantly updated with school
's latest news and information to 
provide parents with a connection to the events and activities on the school campus. School news and calendars are sent home 
and posted on the 
school's social media sites on a monthly basis. Teachers regularly inform paren
ts of student progress through phone calls, conferences, progress reports, 
and behavior charts (if necessary). Parent workshops are presented on a variety of topics, including: parenting skills, techn
ology, curricular materials, 
PBIS/CAMPS, SST Process and
 
assessments. We participate in the Loving Solutions parent program. This helps parents work with their students and 
develop positive relationships at home, which, in turn, supports success at school. We hold transitional meetings and worksho
ps in order to
 
assist parents 
whose children may be transitioning into Kindergarten and/or to middle schools. Our Outreach Consultant and School Counselor 
offer support by 
connecting families with necessary services to address social emotional needs and self
-
care. Addit
ionally, Rose Avenue School conducts an open forum 
for parents and community members to further involve parents in the joint development and joint agreement of its School Paren
tal Involvement Policy. 
The school has forged partnerships with local businesses
 
throughout the community in order to bring additional resources into the school and for our 
families.
 
 
With the strong support of PTA, Rose Avenue will provide several activities to increase parent involvement and reward student
s for meeting their 
academi
c achievement goals. Grade Level family nights focusing on Literacy, Math, and Science will engage parents and families in ac
ademic activities to 
raise awareness and understanding of the expectations set by the Common Core State Standards. Additionally, ev
ents such as the Accelerated Reader 
and MyOn Awards, as well as the trimester Awards Assemblies, have been calendared to provide students with academic incentive
s to meet their learning 
goals. Throughout the year, parents are invited to attend Parent/Teach
er Conferences to collaborate with their child and their child's teacher to review 
achievement data and identify strategies for improving student success. Parents are provided with a description and explanati
on of the curriculum in use 
at the school, the f
orms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and the proficiency levels students are expected to meet.
 
 
Some parents will also be asked to attend Student Success Team meetings if their child has been identified as performing belo
w grade
-
le
vel standards or 
is exhibiting significant needs in social, emotional, and/or behavioral areas. Parent training and education will be coordina
ted and provided by the school's 
Outreach Coordinator to improve parents' ability to support their children's lear
ning.The school will continue to engage parents during School Site 
Council, English Language Advisory Committee, and Parent Teacher Association meetings to promote and sustain parent involveme
nt and home
-
school 
partnerships.
 
 
The School/Parent/Student Comp
act is a part of the School Parent Involvement Policy. Teachers, school administrator and parents developed the 
compact.It describes the responsibilities of the school and parents to improve student performance and the means in which to 
do so. Building cap
acity 
for parent/community involvement is listed in the District Parent Involvement Policy. Specific activities include: Parent pro
ject, Parent 
workshops/training, Parent meetings with specific parent interest topics, Parent meetings with specific student 
learning centered topics, Family Reading 
events, Holiday celebration days, Community celebrations, Grade Level Academic Strand Focus and Science and Wellness Carnival
/Parent Days of 
Presentations/Projects Grade Level Specific.
