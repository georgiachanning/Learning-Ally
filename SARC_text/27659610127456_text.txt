School Description
 
CALIFORNIA GOLD RIBBON DISTINGUISHED SCHOOL.
 
 
Monte Bella Elementary opened its doors for the first time during the 2013
-
2014 school year.  The 
school opened serving grades Pre
-
K through 6th grade and had a total of 550 students.  The sc
hool 
is actually built to house 900 scholars.  This school year, the scholar population has increased to 
829 students. Monte Bella Elementary also has a part
-
time School Psychologist; one part
-
time 
Speech and Language Therapists; a School Counselor, and a 
full
-
time Resource teacher.
 
 
The school is located at 1300 Tuscany Blvd. and is one block south of Alisal High School in the Monte 
Bella Housing Community.  Alisal High will be the feeder high school for our scholars once they 
finish middle school.  Monte 
Bella is located in the North East section of Salinas.  The school itself 
is a closed campus with fencing all around the perimeter that is locked during school hours.  Parents 
and community members must come in to the main office to sign in during school h
ours.
 
 
The mascot(s) for Monte Bella Elementary are the "Scholars".  There is a comprehensive sports 
program for grades 3
-
6 and the mascot for athletics is the "ThunderCats".  The school motto is 
Scholars by day, ThunderCats by night.  99% of our scholars 
wear uniforms on a daily basis with the 
Scholar Shield on the left chest.  Monte Bella Elementary is in its sixth year using the Positive 
Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) system for scholar behavioral expectations.  We imbed 
the wearing of school 
uniforms with PBIS in order for Scholars to qualify for Scholar of the Month.  
Additionally, Scholars are rewarded for adhering to these behavioral expectations with Scholar 
Dollars. Scholars are voraciously collecting their scholar dollars in order to acc
umulate 100 scholar 
dollars so that they can earn their membership cards.  The membership card gives them entry to 
our Scholar store every Wednesday and our monthly PBIS Activity Day.  There is a grand prize at 
the end of the year which is the Limousine Lu
ncheon with the Principal.  We are proud that there 
is minimal discipline on a weekly basis and a 97% attendance rate and PBIS is a direct result of this.
 
 
Student safety and support are top priorities.  Close attention is paid to keeping anti
-
bullying 
asp
ects from infiltrating the environment.  We are also involved with the Olweus anti
-
bullying 
program.  Each week classroom teachers are holding class meetings to address issues that arise 
both socio
-
emotionally and peer
-
to
-
peer.  We have a combination of 25
 
sixth and fifth graders that 
serve as peer mediators, hallway monitors, and Scholar Safety Patrol.  Scholars walk around before 
school, at lunchtime, and after school with special yellow vests and a clipboard assisting students 
with any issues that may ar
ise.  In addition to these efforts, we also have a seven
-
member team of 
campus supervisors that also walk around during recess and lunchtime.  In terms of scholar support, 
we also have partnered with Harmony at Home Counseling services and we have a counse
lor that 
comes one day a week.
 
 
Monte Bella Elementary truly is a 21st Century school.  The school was formulated to emphasize 
Math, Science, and Technology.  Technology is the main emphasis.  Firstly, every classroom has  
surround sound speakers and every
 
teacher uses a lapel microphone.  There is an ELMO projector 
and every teacher is issued a Chromebook computer with six iPad tablets in each classroom.  The 
school has WIFI throughout and every teacher and scholar has immediate connectivity once they 
get 
onto campus.  Second, we are the very first and only public elementary school in our county to 
give every Scholar (K

one Chromebook.  Every parent is required to sign the Parent Technology Use meeting before their son/daughter can be issued 
the
ir Chromebook.  Lastly, teachers are going through an extensive Technology Professional Development program so that they can 
minimally get to the point where they can "Flip the Classroom".  Coupled with the work that our district is doing with implem
enting
 
the 
Common Core State Standards (CCSS), teachers and scholars are producing incredible work.  Teachers train our scholars on List
ening, 
Writing, Reading, and Speaking skills, Text
-
Based Questioning and Close Reading fundamentals as our entry points into C
CSS.  In 
mathematics, our emphasis has been on Reversibility and Flexibility.  Furthermore, teachers have been going through extensive
 
training 
in learning the Engage NY curriculum in both English Language Arts and Mathematics.  Lastly, due to this extensi
ve work, Monte Bella 
Elementary School was awarded the California Gold Ribbon Distinguished School Award for being a model and innovative program 
in the 
area of School Culture and Technology during the 2015
-
16 school year.
 
 
Our school and district is in it
s second year of transitioning from a traditional bilingual program to a Dual Immersion (DI) program beginning 
in Kindergarten.  This means that we will be phasing out our traditional program and go completely DI  We have added two DI k
inder 
classes and th
e program is off to a great start.  Currently, we have DI classes from TK
-
2nd grade.  Our efforts are to build a solid and quality 
DI program that can be as high quality as our technology program.
 
 
Demographics.  In terms of significant subgroups, the scho
lar population is as follows:  Latino 
-
 
95%; Caucasian 
-
 
2%; Asian 
-
 
1%; Other 
-

ulation is 10%.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/

of students who met or exceeded the standard on the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in th
e table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for s
tatistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in t
he test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated usi
ng only students who received scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A major aspect to infuse in our school culture in order to make Monte Bella Elementary a high performing school is high paren
tal involvement.  There 
are many meetings that we must hold t
o meet compliance with state and federal regulations.  Having parents attend these important parent meetings 
is critical to the academic success of the school.  We ask all of our parents/guardians to make it a personal goal to at leas
t pick one of the pare
nt groups 
and attend those meetings at least once a month.  Examples of parent participation opportunities include, but not limited to 
are:  School Site Council, 
English Language Advisory Council, Parent Teacher Organization, District Advisory Council, Par
ent Teacher Conferences, Coffee Klatch, Family Reading 
and Mathematics Night, Field Trip Chaperoning, Classroom Volunteering, Career Day, Winter Program, Talent Show, PBIS, and Ath
letics.
 
 
In order to create extrinsic motivation, the school has implemented
 
a parent involvement Fast Pass program.  Parents are encouraged to participate in 
several of the parent meetings as listed above and they receive a Fast Pass after each meeting for their child to use to go t
o the front of the line at our 
PBIS store.  Once
 
a parent fills out the whole passport, they will then qualify for the end of the year incentives like school uniforms and sch
ool spirit wear.  
For all parent involvement opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact Maria Alvarez, Principal at (831) 77

School Safety Plan
 
As mentioned in sec
tion two, Monte Bella Elementary has always operated under that notion of student safety first.  We have formulated a Safety 
Committee that consists of the school site administration, seven teachers, four parents, two campus supervisors, our lead cus
todian
, our lead food service 
clerk, and one front office secretary.  This group updates our school safety plan on a yearly basis and we take it to the Sch
ool Site Council every January 
to get approved.  The safety plan also places a huge emphasis on the Positiv
e Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) program.  Everything from 
Ingress to Egress, walking to the cafeteria and library, field trips, etc., we have an established code of conduct core value
 
expectations.  These core values 
are being Respectful, Respo
nsible, and Ready.  We call this being a 3R Scholar.  Along with PBIS, we also take not only our safety team but all of our 
teaching staff and we train them in the Olweus Anti
-
Bullying program.  This program has really taken off for us and our parents real
ly love the notion 
that we have brought in this program.  In addition to these programs, we have also implemented the Playworks curriculum for o
rganized "play" during 
recesses.  This has brought down our negative student behavior issues completely.  Lastly
, we also have a flip chart that we have created for all staff on 
different type of emergency situations that may arise and how staff should conduct themselves in the case of these unforeseen
 
events.  Every month we 
practice a fire drill and in October and
 
in the spring, we practice an earthquake drill.  These drills are recorded on a chart in the main office that is placed 
for public display.
