Principal's Message
 
A
ll students at Portola Elementary School have access to a variety of wonderful opportunities 
because our small, intimate setting ensures students have frequent adult
-
child interactions and 
staff members demonstrate a kind and caring attitude. The decision
-
making process of the School 
Site Council (SSC) and Parent Teacher Association (PTA) focuses on balancing the importance of 
student achievement and the development of the whole child. The school community and PTA 
strive to provide extras opportunities, inc
luding physical education for all grades. Portola is a pilot 
site for Recology's Zero Waste initiative and Dr. Krotz is a fellow in the San Mateo County Office of 
Education Environmental Sustainability program. Portola is focusing on becoming a Zero Waste 
school every day, with different activities and projects scheduled throughout the year.
 
 
Portola is a school with many traditions that the students have come to love. In the fall, students 
participate in an annual schoolwide hike to the top of Sweeney Ridg
e, where explorer Gaspar de 
Portol√†

for whom the school is named

was the first European to see San Francisco Bay in 1769. 
In March, the students celebrate Read Across America Day with a schoolwide morning reading 
program, and each spring, the school holds 
a family potluck, where the entire Portola community 
comes together for an evening of food and fellowship. STEM experiences and a schoolwide Science 
Fair are held annually. The end of the year culminates with Field day and 5th
-
grade promotion.
 
 
Dr. Sheila 
Krotz
 
Principal
 
 
The San Bruno Park School District will engage and inspire our students to be productive critical 
thinkers who embrace diversity, curiosity, and innovation throughout their lives.
 
 
The members of the Portola Elementary School family are co
mmitted to developing a positive 
learning environment that addresses individual learning styles. As a community of teachers, 
students, staff, and parents, it is our purpose to present a rich, meaningful, developmentally 
appropriate curriculum. We strive to
 
empower children to set high standards and to achieve their 
personal best. We aim to ensure that each student acquires the knowledge, confidence, and skills 
necessary to succeed in our school and beyond. Our ultimate goal is to provide students with a 
var
iety of academic and social experiences that promote leadership, creativity, individual 
responsibility, and a joy of lifelong learning. Portola's mission and vision complement the District's 
Portrait of a Graduate by encompassing the core tenets: Communica
tor, Creative/Innovative, 
Contributor, Critical Thinker, Collaborator, and Compassionate. These core values embody the 
culture and climate of Portola and students are individually recognized at our weekly awards 
ceremony every Thursday.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Pl
an (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
