School Description
 
Skyblue Mesa serves approximately 550 students in transitional kindergarten through sixth grade 
on an academic year calendar which begins in August and ends in June. There are three Special Day 
Classes on campus that serve approximately 
40 Special Education students total.
 
 
Skyblue Mesa employs 25 fully credentialed teachers.  We also have a school psychologist 60% of 
the time, a school counselor 40% of the time, a school social worker 60% of the time, a full time 
and part time (3 days pe
r week) Language and Speech Pathologist, several instructional and 
behavioral aides that provide support in the K classrooms, intervention programs, and our special 
day classes.
 
 
In order to create a safe and positive learning environment for students to t
hrive in, we employ 
PBIS school wide.  With this, school expectations for behavior are posted all over the school 
including the classrooms.  These expectations are explicitly taught and positively rewarded.  There 
is an emphasis on positive reinforcement a
nd building positive relationships with students on our 
school campus to foster a supportive school culture.
 
 
The mission of Skyblue Mesa Elementary School is to provide a high quality and rigorous education 
in a safe learning environment that supports stu
dent engagement and achievement.  We strive to 
prepare all students to be lifelong learners, and productive and responsible citizens.
 
 
At Skyblue Mesa Elementary School, we envision ourselves:
 
* collaborating as a community of staff, students, and parents 
to maintain the expectation that all 
students can succeed.
 
* building strong critical thinking and problem solving skills.
 
* focusing on student achievement of rigorous academic standards.
 
* implementing research
-
based instructional methods in all classroo
ms.
 
* promoting a climate of mutual respect by modeling and teaching expected behaviors as identified 
on our PBIS Matrix and our school's Code of Conduct.
 
* communicating with one another clearly and respectfully.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest
 
is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access
 
is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restricti
ons may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https:/
/www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Arts Curriculum that is Common Core 
aligned, Next Generation Science Standards, strategies to improve literacy and numeracy skills, and the development of Critic

continue to integrate technology into the curriculum and design interv
ention programs to help all children achieve proficient and above in language arts 
and math. We work closely with our district Teachers on Special Assignment in Physical Education, Arts Integration, ELD and T
echnology to enhance our 
programs and provide st
