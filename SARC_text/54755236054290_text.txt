About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Prio
rity 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Asses
sments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standar
ds, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the Uni
versity of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

School Safety Plan
 
The 
safety of students and staff is a primary concern of West Putnam Elementary School. Teachers and other staff supervise studen
ts on campus before 
and after school and during recess, while staff supervisors monitor students during the lunch break. All visito

receive proper authorization to be on campus. Visitors are asked by the staff to display their pass at all times while visiti
ng the campus. For the safety of 
our students, all volunteers are fingerprinted and c
leared through the Department of Justice. Appointments are made with the school secretary.
 
 
The School Site Safety Plan was most recently revised in Fall 2019 by the Safety Committee, and reviewed annually. Key elemen
ts of the plan focus on 
emergency 
preparedness. The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state e
arthquake 
standards. Emergency drills are held on a regular basis; fire drills are held once a month, earthquake and lock
-
down dril
ls are held once each semester.

A constructive evaluation process promotes quality instruction and is a fundamental element in a sound educational program. E
valuations and formal 
observations are designed to encourage
 

probationary teachers are evaluated annually and tenured teachers are evaluated every other year.
 
 
Evaluations are conducted by site administrators, who h
ave been trained and certified for competency to perform teacher evaluations. Evaluation criteria 
include the following:
 

 
Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning
 

 
Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning
 

 
Assessing Student Lea
rning
 

 
Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning
 

 
Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all Students
 

 
Developing as a Professional Educator
 
Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation
 
in conferences and workshops throughout the year. For the past three years, the 
district has offered seven minimum days to be used as staff development days, as well as ongoing training on how to effective
ly implement the new 
California standards and shif
ts in instructional strategies. Professional development is provided during staff meetings. Selected teachers received 
additional training in math, English Language Arts, and science provided the district through contracted Tulare County Office
 
of Educatio
n facilitators 
periodically during the school year. 
 
 
During this time, teachers are offered a broad
-
based variety of professional growth opportunities in the curriculum, teaching strategies, and 
methodologies. The school uses the Best Practices teaching s
trategies and teachers are trained in the techniques each year. The district has provided an 
on
-
site instructional coach to assist all teachers with implementation of the new California standards and instructional strateg
ies.
