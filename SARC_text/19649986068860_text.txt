About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Since 1988, California has sought to provide intensive learning experiences for beginning teachers.  To provide an effective 
transition into the teaching 
career for first
-
year and second
-
year teachers, several programs have been developed statewide and are
 
in use in our district.  The statewide Induction 
Program and Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) programs extend individual support and training for new and experienced teachers
.
 
 
Professional growth activities are planned annually based on current needs and
 

work calendar has included three professional development days.  Workshops on professional effectiveness and classroom skills
 
focus on Next 
Generation Science Standards, social emo
tional learning as well as other opportunities that align to our core curriculum and best practices of delivery.
 
 
Committees comprised of teachers and administrators reviewed the state standards and adapted them for our curriculum for math
ematics, language
 
arts, history
-
social science and science.  These standards
-
based documents are the foundation for what is taught and assessed in our district.
 
 
For the current school year at Highlands, staff meeting time and collaborative instructional planning time is f
ocused on the implementation of 
professional learning communities and how to best meet the needs of our students, raising rigor in the classroom, and data
-
driven decision making in 
order to increase student achievement and close gaps in learning between di
fferent learning groups.
