M
alcolm X Elementary School's focus on arts and academics is a formula that has led to 
the school's 
continued success. In 2016, Malcolm X Elementary was named Gold Ribbon School by the California 
Department of Education. This recognition was based on our signature practice in Response to 
Intervention and Instruction (RTI2), an articulated sy
stem of supports and practices to support 
students' academic success and social
-
emotional wellbeing. In 2016 the school also received the 
Title I Academic Achievement Award, granted to schools with demonstrated success in closing the 
achievement gap for so
cioeconomically disadvantaged students. These awards continue a tradition 
of recognition of Malcolm X's academic excellence, as the school was selected as a California 
Distinguished School in 2012 and 2006 and a Title One Achievement award in 2009.
 
 
In add
ition to academic excellence, we also received the commendation from the CDE for our 
Exemplary Arts Program in 2016. At Malcolm X, our focus on the Visual and Performing Arts is 
another vehicle to promote student academic success, through engaging students
, nurturing 
student creativity and expression, and allowing them to develop a wide array of talents and 
interests. arts programs. All students receive instruction in the four artistic disciplines
-
 
visual art, 
music, dance, and drama. This arts focus is pre
sent throughout the school year, either with a 
specialist or integrated into the academic curriculum, and students receive specific instruction to 
help them acquire the skills to express themselves through the arts. Students perform in grade level 
dramatic
 
performances of increasing complexity every year. Weekly dance classes provide students 
with a lifelong form of physical exercise that encourages teamwork and self
-
expression, and helps 
to fulfill the state Physical Education requirements. In alignment wi
th the state's Visual and 
Performing Arts standards, students also develop a sense of art history and an appreciation of the 
artistic traditions of many cultures. Every year all students are exposed to high
-
quality professional 
performances by local, natio
nal, and international dance, music, and theatrical groups. Connections 
made between the art disciplines and other academic areas help engage students in their learning, 
and build a sense of community at the school.
 
 

 

of making our school work. Teachers at Malcolm X plan together as a team, sharing their ideas and 
techniques to ensure that all students have access to the best possible lessons. This collaborative 
e
thic is also demonstrated by the way that parents and the school come together to help students 

volunteers support student learning in a variety of ways. Our sch
ool has an active PTA chapter, 
which plans community events and raises funds to support our school programs.
 
 
Students at Malcolm X develop an enthusiasm for learning, an appreciation for diversity, and a 
healthy spirit of inquiry. After school, 
Malcolm X offers extended learning opportunities that are 
linked to the academic and arts programs during the day. Students have the opportunity to 
continue their learning through programs such as LEARNS and BEARS after school programs, Project 
Connect aft
er school intervention, and a variety of PTA
-
sponsored classes. Our goal is to provide 
each child with the educational experience that they need in order to thrive.
 
 
Sincerely,

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is requ
ired by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs
) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an
 
LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should co
ntact the school principal or the 
district office.

Williams legislation calls for the schools to have enough books in core classes for all students and asks districts to indica
te whether those books are 
presenting information outlined in
 
the California content standards.  Textbook materials are adopted by the school board following a rotating adoption 
cycle for subject specific state adopted textbooks and instructional materials.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Malcolm X Elementary School was constructed in
 
1922 and covers 3.3 acres. Facilities include 27 permanent classrooms, a library, a staff room, a 
multipurpose room/auditorium, a playground, a school garden, a music room, a Reading Recovery room, a science/art room, and a
 
cafeteria. 
Comprehensive seismi
c retrofitting to this historic building happened in 1999. Recent improvements include new roofing for the entire building an
d the 
installation of solar panels. The building underwent major renovations during the 16
-
17 school year, including installing ene
rgy efficient double paned 
windows, replacing stucco on the original building,  and improved flooring in classrooms and hallways. The next planned facil
ities upgrade is to renovate 
the cafeteria and kitchen in the next few school years.
 
 
The district admin
isters a scheduled maintenance program to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. A
 
work 
order process alerts district personnel of any maintenance needed to be performed and ensures that emergencies are given the 
highest priority.
 
 
Safety issues are the top priority for Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors inspect school sites cont
inually and complete repairs 
in a timely manner. They use a work order process to ensure an efficient, prioritiz
ed repair process. The district maintenance staff has indicated that 
100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
n
g a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office of Public School Construction.

School Safety Plan
 
A safe school environment is the bedrock on which students' learning and growth rests. During lunch, recesses, and before
-
and
-
after scho
ol, staff 
members and the principal supervise students and school grounds to ensure an orderly, safe environment. The school is always 
fully compliant with all 
rules, laws, and regulations concerning state earthquake standards and hazardous materials. Eart
hquake and fire drills are held regularly, and lockdown 
procedure drills are practiced at least once a year. Safety procedures, including elements of our Comprehensive Safe School P
lan, are reviewed with 
school and district staff at the start of each schoo
l year. The plan is updated annually, and the staff reviews our emergency each year. The coordinated 
Emergency Disaster plan adopted by Berkeley Unified School District and Malcolm X Elementary in 2011 is based on the National
 
Incident Management 
System gu
idelines created by FEMA, and this plan is updated annually. This enables our staff to better coordinate with local, state, a
nd federal emergency 
workers in the case of an emergency. Our School Safety Plan and emergency procedures are reviewed and updated 
every year, and staff is trained 
annually to ensure that we are as prepared as possible in the case of an emergency.
 
 
Each year, our safety plan includes site level goals that address needs we have identified in the school. One goal in the Saf
ety Plan incl
ude reducing the 
number of behavioral incidents requiring office referrals or suspension. Strategies to achieve this goal include implementati
on of school
-
wide positive 
discipline practices, and building home
-
school communication around behavior expectatio
ns. All Malcolm X teachers are trained in the Welcoming 
Schools anti
-
bullying curriculum, and implemented lessons from this program in their classroom. The entire school is also trained in the s
chool wide 
Positive Behavior Support program. Our school teach
es social emotional skills through a program called Toolbox, which teaches students different skills 
for conflict resolution and self
-
regulation. A second goal in the Safety Plan is the improvement of traffic safety around the school. This has been identif
ied 
as an area of concern due to the density of traffic in adjoining streets, and the frequency of traffic accidents involving ch
ildren in the area. Our rolling 
morning drop
-
off zone was consistently staffed by parent volunteers from each classroom on a ro
tating basis. Our third safety plan goal is related to 
disaster preparedness, and includes action steps related to practice for a variety of emergencies, as well as communication w
ith parents about our 
emergency procedures.
