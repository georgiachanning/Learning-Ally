By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General: The district places a strong emphasis on 
ensuring that all schools are safe, clean, environmentally friendly, 
mechanically functional and inviting for students, staff members, and the community. To assist in this effort, the district 
utilizes Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State 
of California OPSC and local operations department developed 
inspection survey methods to keep facilities in compliance with all federal and state health and safety regulations. The 
district regularly inspects and reviews the condition of the school facili
ties and surrounding grounds. The district places 
the highest priority on those safeguards that impact the fire, life and safety protection of the students, staff, and school 
buildings. Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and 
the efforts made to ensure that students 
are provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.
 
 
Age of School Buildings: Sierramont was opened in 1978. This school has 36 regular classrooms; a computer lab; art, 
instrumental music, and chor
al music rooms; a multipurpose room; a library, and an administration building. In addition 
to the main classrooms, there are five portable classrooms added to provide addition classroom space.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures th
at the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair 
and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order system process is used to ensure efficient service and 
highest priority is given to emergency repairs. At the time of publication, 1

in good working order. This site also had interior and exterior lighting upgrades completed through the Energy 
Conservation Assistance Act in identified areas throughout the campus.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedul
e: The district has developed cleaning standards and schedules for all schools in the district. 
A summary of these standards and schedules is available at the school or the Maintenance & Operations office. The 
principal, with the guidance of the maintenanc
e supervisor works daily with the custodial team to ensure that the cleaning 
standards are met, and that classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean, safe, and well
-
maintained.
 
 
Modernization Projects: All scheduled Modernization projects were
 
completed as a part of (Measure L) during the 2016/17

Parent 
participation at Sierramont is essential to our success, and we have a number of avenues through which parents 
can participate. Our Parent, Teacher, School Association (PTSA) meets on a scheduled basis, raises funds through 
donations and activities, and wo
rks on schoolwide projects. Parents on our School Site Council are elected by their peers 
for SSC positions.The council oversees the school plan for student achievement, and the categorical funds tied to those

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Student and staff safety at Sierramont is our most important consideration, and we have taken measures to insure that 
every person on campus is secure and that 
the school climate promotes a positive tone conducive to learning. As a result 
of our involvement with a city safety initiative, the city of San Jose provides resources that help us improve campus safety 
and are on call when needed. Members of our staff su
pervise our campus 10 minutes before the start of school and 
immediately after dismissal. Staff also supervise students during break and lunch. We also require all visitors to register 
with the office.

Individual school sites offer Supplemental 
Instruction (SI) to students who are below grade level. It is up to each individual 
school sit e to identify the students who need extra support based upon district benchmarks or teacher recommendations. 
Each school site selects certificated and classified
 
staff to teach these SI classes, usually after school (1 

 
3 days a week). 
Each school also identifies the curriculum that will be used. The majority of the school sites select computer
-
 
based 
programs w here students can work independently at their curre
nt academic level. Some schools provide this time to 
receive help on their homework.

Professional Development this school year occurred on many different levels 

 
before school started (summer of 2019) 
and ongoing throughout the 2019 

 
2020 school year.  The district office working with our site principals and curriculum 
leadership teams developed the scope/sequence of the professional development.  Leadership teams
 
reviewed student 
data produced from benchmark tests, ELPAC, and SBAC data, as well as staff feedback when developing the scope and 
sequence.

At the beginning of the school year, all certificated and classified staff participated in two days of profession
al 
development aligned to their instructional role and needs.  TK
-
5 teachers received training on providing effective Tier 1 
instruction in math and ELA.  Special education staff, social workers and psychologists received training on topics pertinent
 
to th
eir needs such as All Learning is Social Emotional, TCI De
-
Escalation, Instructional Scaffolding to Assist and Support 
Student , and Data Collection and Behavior Management.  Middle school staff received specialized training related to the 
content they tea
ch, that focused on the social emotional element of learning as well as recently adopted curriculum.  All 
middle school teachers participated in a workshop on understanding gender.  Training for new teachers focused on 

 
and assessment programs.   Classified staff participated in some sessions with their 
certificated colleagues in order to have the opportunity to collaborate while learning.  They also attended other sessions 
designed to meet their specific professional ne
eds.
 
 
During the school year middle school, science teachers were released up to three days to collaborate on implementation 
of the new science program.  Middle school math and writing teachers scored and/or analyze student benchmarks during 
release days f
or each grade.  7th grade science teachers were released for 1
-

comprehensive sexuality program.  Additional training was offered on release day for special education teachers to 
support implementation of our dyslexia c
urriculum as well as special education components of our ELA programs.
 
 
Throughout the school year, we offered monthly professional development sessions in which all teachers participated (1.5 
hours on 10 early release Thursday afternoons).  Principals and
 
district office administrators chose the topics for the 2019
-
2020 school year in alignment with the District focus on developing a multi
-
tiered system of support.
 
 
The Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL) program was implemented at six of our ten elemen
tary schools in grades TK
-
3.  The schools included were Cherrywood, Laneview, Summerdale, Brooktree, Toyon and Vinci Park.   Teachers in the first 
two years of implementation received three two
-
day training modules each followed by a day of unit planning. 
 
Teachers 
in the third and fourth year of implementation participated in three days of unit planning.  Contracted SEAL experts 
provided the module training sessions and three district instructional coaches facilitated the follow up planning PD 
sessions.  T
eachers were released from their classrooms for all of these PD days.
 
 
Four instructional coaches provided BTSA induction training for all teachers who qualified to receive BTSA training and 
support. Additionally, BUSD teachers provide PAR assistance to te
achers who are in need of additional assistance.  All 
teachers have access to an instructional coach so that they can receive follow up support on implementing new learning 
attended through professional development.
 
 
An MTSS committee and Differentiated As
sistance Team received 3
-
5 days of training on change management facilitated 
by WestEd and the Santa Clara County Office of Education.  Some members also participated in 3 training sessions of 
equity.  Team members then trained principals during monthly pr
ofessional development meetings.   The focus of both 
teams aligned with the district goal of developing multi
-
tiered systems of support at each site.
