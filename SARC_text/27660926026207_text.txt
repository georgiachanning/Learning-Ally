School Description
 
 
Welcome to George C. Marshall Elementary School located in Seaside, California.
 
 
At Marshall we prepare and guide our learners to bring a S.T.E.M. approach to the challenges of an 
ever 
changing world. Our scholars develop and investigate curiosities, and explore them in an 
emotionally and physically safe environment. Our learning community embraces challenge and 
enjoys learning.
 
 
Our students engage in a rigorous learning experience each
 
day, in which they work collaboratively 
with their peers to acquire the skills, dispositions, and knowledge necessary to become influential 
members of our 21st century society. Science and Engineering Practices, Mathematical Practices, 
digital citizenship
, and self regulation techniques are cornerstones to the learning journey for every 
student at Marshall Elementary School.
 
 
Marshall ensures a safe, nurturing, and flexible environment in which each student can attain 
academic and social success through th
e collaboration and dedication of our students, teachers, 
parents, and community. Marshall serves students in Transitional Kindergarten through 5th Grade. 
The school serves a majority of military families, as it is located on the former Fort Ord military 
b
ase. We work hard to support our families who are faced with the many demands of military life. 
Our Army and School Liaison Officer, Military Family Life Consultant, Family Services Specialists and 
Bilingual Community Liaison can assist families with trans
ition to our school. We have military 
affiliated programs such as Elementary Student 2 Student and Anchored 4 Life, which provide all 
students with leadership opportunities and supports through transitions and other life experiences.
 
 
Meet and talk with ou
r teaching staff to learn about our rigorous instructional practices and the 
Common Core State Standards. All staff participate in professional development related to 
maintaining a positive school culture and refining innovative instructional practices. Ma
rshall has 
been the proud recipient of several Department of Defense Education Activities (DODEA) grants 
that have provided additional social emotional resources and staff professional developments, in 
addition to allowing us to enhance our STEM program.
 
 
Partnerships are essential to Marshall's achievements. We actively seek professional relationships 
with military organizations such as the Porter Youth Center, Army Community Services, Military 
Coalition, and the Presidio of Monterey. We also partner with 
The Parks at Monterey Bay, California 
State University at Monterey Bay, Return to the Natives, the Arts Council, and with parents, 
guardians, and relatives. All of us understand that raising and educating scholars takes a 
comprehensive effort from many car
ing and dedicated people. We hope you will join our cause by 
becoming a member of our PTA, a vital component to the life of Marshall, where volunteerism is 
critical to a healthy and rich school culture.

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Monterey Peninsula Unified School District held a public hearing on 
August 2019, and determined that the school had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials, pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, incl
uding English learners, are given 
their own individual 
standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks 
and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making 
the textbooks used in the 
school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation 
is made to the School 
Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recomme
nded materials are available for parent examination at the district 
office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in August 2018 about the quality, currency, and availabili
ty of the California Common 
Core standards

School Facility Conditions
 
and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
In 2010, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District overwhelmingly approved Measure P, a $110 million locally
-
controlled school bond measure to 
fund the first phase of critical repairs and improvement to our
 
local schools. The district's newest school was built in 1965, more than 50 years ago, and 
our Facilities Needs Assessment has identified over $680 million in critical repairs to all MPUSD schools. Recently, in 2018,
 
voters approved Measure I, a 
$213 mill
ion school facilities bond by 70%.
 
 
Many school bond projects are underway. Visit www.mpusd.net and search for Measure I & P Dollars at Work for additional detai
ls.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online 
supplement to this report called for by the Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The impo
rtant purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for
 
this 
assessment were written 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents make up an essential component of the 

educational community through the PTA (Parent Teacher Association) network of volunteers, or individually by contacting their
 

principal, 
or our office staff at (831) 899
-
7052. The School Site Council, the English Learner Advisory Committee, and our active PTA are a few avenues 
for structured parent involvement. The PTA sponsors classroom field trips, teacher grants, PBIS (Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports) incentives, 
monthly family nights and various seasonal activities. Volunteering to provide supervision on field trips, at recess time, or
 
before and after school are 
valuable ways in which parents can help to build home and scho
ol connections. All volunteers are required  to fill out a volunteer and liability release 
form.  Special events like the Book Fair, the Just Run program, Family Nights, Dads & Donuts, Moms & Muffins, and periodic ca
mpus beautification 
activities provide a
dditional opportunities to enhance our school community through parent involvement.
 
 
Please visit our PTA Facebook page.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety and well being of students and staff are high priorities for the Monterey Peninsula Unified 
School District and this school. Under Senate Bill 
187, every school in the district is required to complete (or review and update) a School Safety Plan by March 1 of each year
. The plan is reviewed and

Highlight's of this s
chool's plan are detailed below.
 
 
We make safety a priority at Marshall School. Our school and grounds provide a safe environment for learning. Discipline poli
cies prohibit fighting and 
curtail bullying, and we strive as a school to build a climate of resp
ect for each other. The Marshall Behavior Expectations, a component of our Positive 
Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), are practiced by all students: Respect self, others, and our surroundings; Act 
responsibly; Support and 
encourage each other. 
The Second Step curriculum is used by all grade levels to assist in the development of good citizens and provide scholars wit
h the 
tools to solve problems constructively and peacefully.  We have a Family Service Specialist, Mental Health Counselor, Militar
y Family Life Counselor, and 
a Community Liaison on site to assist students with any situations they experience with family, school, or transition to a ne
w school site.
 
 
Staff members monitor the playground and cafeteria before school and during recess and
 
lunch. All visitors register first at the office before coming onto 
school grounds.
 
 
Each year we update our safety plan, and we routinely practice ALICE safety protocols, earthquake, shelter in place and fire 
drills. The plan is available 
for parents to 
review. We teach playground equipment rules and playground games, and we supervise students at each recess. Our school safety
 
committee reviews procedures for emergencies and plays an important role in our Disaster Preparedness Plan, an ongoing assess
ment 
of procedures for 
emergencies. Each month we practice a fire drill; at least once a quarter we practice ALICE, earthquake and emergency shelter
 
in place drills.
 
 
We ask that all visitors to the site honor our visitor protocol: always visit the office befor
e you come on site during the school day to sign in, and always

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Three areas of focus for 
professional development at Marshall are in small group instruction and STEM Implementation. A focus on the refinement of 
small group instruction is based on ELA achievement scores on SBAC, IReady, and F&P. This focus will guide teachers in being 
able to t
arget specific needs 
of learners and to teach to those needs in a small group setting. The focus on increasing the rigor of student work and imple
menting STEM practices 
originates from Youth Truth data that shows students perceive their work as less than c
hallenging and often irrelevant. As teachers become more 
proficient in building rigor into work and integrating STEM across curriculum, students will have more opportunities to be ch
allenged, to embrace that 
challenge, and to discover and apply its relevan
ce in the real world.
 
 
Teachers attend weekly professional developments to improve their teaching practices in these areas, and to increase their un
derstanding of social 
emotional development and the impact it may have on the learning experience. In additi
on, teachers receive individualized feedback from the 
instructional leader and academic coach through regular observation and feedback cycles. The principal and academic coach fac
ilitate quarterly grade 
level data and differentiation days and learning walk
s. All teachers participate in district level professional development opportunities related to new 
standards, curricular adoptions and research
-
based instructional practices.

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 
2018, 
regarding how to calculate school
-
level per
-
pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded
 
A majority of funding reported as districtwide costs is expended for school level expenditures, therefore the results appear 
to be 
lower operating costs 
at the school site level.
 
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional infor
mation about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, s
taffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at 
libraries and public locations
 
is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length 
of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation
,
 
and the ability to print 
documents.
