School Description
 
Washington Elementary School is a TK
-
1 school serving approximately 430 
students in 2019
-
2020 
and is located in the small rural town of Mendota, approximately 35 miles west of Fresno. It is one 
of five schools in the Mendota Unified School District. The student population of Washington 
Elementary has a 99.7% Hispanic ethnicity
 
background, with 85.4% of the students qualifying as 

where they receive English Language Development (ELD), and are provided with Specially Designed 
Academic I
nstruction in English (SDAIE) as needed. Washington Elementary is considered school 
wide Title I. Poverty is apparent in the agriculture
-
based community, where 99% of the students 
qualify to participate in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). 1% of th
e students qualify for 
RSP/SDC services and 2,6% receive Language and Speech (LAS) services in pull
-
out settings. Migrant 
students make up 6.8% of the student population, while 9.2% are immigrants, having entered the 
United States in the last 5 years. Thes
e migrant students receive tutoring services in small group 
situations. Each classroom has a class set of Chromebooks computers for student use and 100% of 
the classrooms have Internet access. 94% of the teachers are fully credentialed. 
 
 
The Washington El
ementary School program has much strength upon which to build. We have the 
services of a Guidance Instructional Support (GIS) and an Academic Coach, who assisted both the 
teachers and the principal in the daily operations of our school. Washington Elementa
ry currently 
has in place a student/parent handbook, parent compact, dress code policy, School Site Council, 
English Learners Advisory Committee, as well as a leadership team that is the key component in 
decision
-
making. The district provides a variety of 
services to our parents. A three
-
hour after school 
tutoring program has been funded through the After School Program Grant in which approximately 
50 students are served. Parent/School communication is enhanced through monthly bilingual 
activity calendars, 
parent/teacher conferences, forms, flyers, and our multiple measurements used 
to help determine promotion and retention. Student data from our multiple measures is recorded 
on classroom spreadsheets and loaded onto Illuminate, a computer database system, t
o have an 
ongoing evaluation instrument of student success. The staff uses classroom data to follow the 
progress of each student, and to develop differentiated curriculum and efficient communication of 
student progress throughout the school year. Teachers 
also collaborate about best practices and 
strategies for student success through professional learning communities. Student profile cards are 
also used to provide a continuum of information for the next year teacher. 
 
 
Parents want to be involved in their 

hosts quarterly "Parent Nights" where teachers share with parents concepts being taught in the 
classrooms and provide materials and training on their use so parents may help their children at 
hom
e. They are encouraged to visit the classrooms any time and our Adult Education Program 
offers parents opportunities to take preparation courses to test for the GED, work towards units to 
obtain a high school diploma, as well as English as a Second Languag
e classes.

ed in the learning process, so 
that every venue is researched, explored and attempted in our quest to reach our vision that all students be on grade level. 
 
 
We will do this by: 
 

 
Promoting parent involvement.
 

 
Providing support for at

risk 
students.
 

 
Differentiating instruction.
 

 
Integration of technology.
 

 
Developing character through the six pillars.
 
Open communication among all stakeholders. 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each y
ear, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCF
F) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priori
ties. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/gu
ardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Washington Elementary, in an effort to build the school community, provides parents with various opportunities to participate
 
in the day to day activities 
of the school.
 
 
Parents are invited and 
encouraged to attend and actively participate in some of these activities and events such as: School Site Council meetings, E
nglish 
Learners Advisory Committee, Title I, DELAC, and PIQE. They are also invited to participate in classroom visitations, Parent
 
Nights, field trips, the school 
carnival, "Pastries with Parents" Social, Winter Program, Spring Performance, and Parent Trainings.
 
 
In general, teachers are the main contact who initiate parent participation, but both administrators (Principal and GIS) e
ncourage parent participation at 
the different events held at the school or district levels.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Washington Elementary's School Safety Plan is revised on an annual basis.  Revisions occur at the beginning of each school ye
ar to ensure the that all 
members of the school understand the pl
an itself and their roles in the plan.
 
 
An element included in our safety plan is an emergency response roster.  Our Emergency Response Roster outlines duties for al
l staff members in the 
course of an emergency and/or disaster. The following 
sections are formed: Site Operations, Site Planning, Site Logistics, and Site Finance. All personnel 
have specific responsibilities in the event that a practice or real drill comes upon us. Specific areas are designated for pa
rent/student reunification, fi
rst 
aid, and lock
-
down.
 
 
Our school safety plan was shared with the staff and roles and responsibilities were reviewed.  The safety plan is also revie
wed after practicing various 
lock down and emergency drills throughout the school year.  Our safety plan w
as last discussed at our school site council meeting on September 16, 
2019.

Types of Services Funded
 
Washington Elementary provided a variety of services to the educational community to support and assist not only our students
, but also to support 
parents in their quest to continually become partners in education.
 
In the area of English Language Developme
nt, Washington Elementary implemented the use of California Wonders and supplements the program with 
other programs and materials such as Language for Learning (program) and materials such as manipulatives and visuals (posters
, vocabulary cards, etc.) 
to e
nhance language acquisition.  These supplemental materials were funded by categorical programs such as Title I.
 
When students were at risk, Washington Elementary provided Title I funded interventions such as extended learning (individual
 
teacher tutoring a
nd/or 
use of Imagine Learning, computer
-
based tutoring) or summer school, to provide opportunities for student success or student study team services to 
determine the need for special education services.
 
Washington Elementary provided Parent Nights where t
eachers present and train parents in the concepts being taught in the classroom and are given 
materials they can use to help their children learn those concepts.  Parents were also provided Early Literacy courses throug
h PIQE and Fresno County.  
These pare
nting classes are hands on and also provide free materials and strategies to our parents.
