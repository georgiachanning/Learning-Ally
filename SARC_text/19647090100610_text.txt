)The California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress (CAASPP) 
System includes the Smarter Balanced 
Summative Assessments (SBAC) for students 
in the general education population, and the 
California Alternate Assessments (CAAs) for 
students with the most significant cognitive 
disabilities.  Only eligible students may 
participate in the administration of the CAAs.  
CAAs items are aligned with alternative 
achievement standards, which are linked 
with the Common Core State Standards 
(CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of 
how well students are mastering California™s 
standards in English language arts/literacy 
(ELA) and mathematics, and are given to 
grades three through eight and grade eleven. 
SBAC tests assess student performance 
in ELA/Literacy and mathematics utilizing 
computer-adaptive tests and performance 
tasks, and CAAs test items are aligned with 
alternative achievement standards which 
are linked with the Common Core State 
Standards (CCSS). The CAASPP results shown in this report 
include overall results comparing the school, 
district and state scores as well as the 
school™s overall score in each applicable 
subgroup. Results are shown only for 
subgroups with ten students or more taking 
the exam. For those categories that are blank 
in the tables, no students met subgroup 
criteria. More information on CAASPP can

 INSPECTIONS
The district™s maintenance department 
inspects Dolores Huerta Elementary School 
on an annual basis in accordance with 
Education Code §17592.72(c)(1).  Dolores 
Huerta Elementary School uses a school 
site inspection survey to identify unsafe or 
hazardous conditions and facility improvement 
needs. The most recent school inspection 
took place on November 26, 2018.  During 
fiscal year 2018-19, all restrooms were fully 
functional and available for student use at 
the time of the inspection.SCHOOL
 SITE
 SAFETY
 PLAN
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan 
was developed for Dolores Huerta Elementary 
in collaboration with local agencies and 
the district office to fulfill Senate Bill 187 
requirements.  Components of this plan include 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, 
disaster response procedures, procedures 
for safe arrival and departure from school, 
sexual harassment policy, dress code policy, 
and bully prevention policy. The school™s most 
current safety plan was reviewed, updated, 
and shared with school staff in Fall 2019.
SUPERVISION
 & 
SAFETY
At the beginning of the school day, students 
arrive through a single entrance which is 
supervised by an administrator, and support 
staff. From 7:45 to 8:15 a.m., teachers, and 
supervision aides monitor students in the

 FACILITIES

SAFETY
FACILITIES
 MAINTENANCE
The district takes great efforts to ensure that 
all schools are clean, safe, and functional 
through proper facilities maintenance 
and campus supervision. Dolores Huerta 
Elementary School™s original facilities were 
built in 2008; ongoing maintenance and 
campus improvements ensure facilities 
remain up to date and provide adequate 
space for students and staff. 
District maintenance and site custodial 
staff ensure that the repairs necessary 
to keep the school in good condition are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order 
process is used by school and district staff 
to communicate non-routine maintenance 
requests. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. 
Every morning before school begins, the day 
custodian inspects facilities for safety hazards 
or other conditions that need attention prior to 
students and staff entering school grounds. 
One full-time day, one full-time evening, and 
one part-time evening custodian are assigned 
to Dolores Huerta Elementary School. The 
day custodian is responsible for:Ł General CleaningŁ Restroom CleaningŁ Cafeteria Setup/CleanupŁ Debris RemovalŁ Graffiti Removal
Restrooms are checked three times a day 
for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned 
as needed. The evening custodians are 
responsible for:central area of the playground. Students 
are served breakfast in the cafeteria from 7:45 to 8:05 a.m. One crossing guard is 
on duty at 104th Street and one crossing 
guard is located at 105th Street to direct 
traffic and help students cross the street 
safely. During recess, two teachers  and the 
assistant principal monitor student behavior 
on the playground. During lunch recess, 
two supervision aides and the assistant 
principal monitor students in the cafeteria; 
four aides monitor playground activity and 
three aides are located in the playing field. 
At the end of the day, students depart 
through two exits which are supervised by 
an administrator, and support staff.   
The campus is fully secured with perimeter 
fencing; during school hours there is only 
one entry which directs visitors to the school 
office. Many individuals visit the campus 
as volunteers or to participate in school 
events. To maintain a safe and secure 
environment, all parents and visitors are 
required to check in at the school office. 
Upon arrival, parents and visitors must 
provide picture identification, obtain and 
wear a visitor™s badge to be scanned through 
the Raptor System, and then return to the 
school office upon departure.

clearly defines unacceptable behavior and 
consequences for poor conduct. Teachers 
integrate Character Counts and Dr. Olweus™ 
Bullying Prevention strategies to promote 
respect responsibility through daily instruction 
and weekly student meetings. Teachers have established individual, 
grade appropriate classroom management 
plans in accordance with district™s assertive 
discipline policies; these plans are 
submitted for approval by the principal 
each year. Concentrations are placed in 
redirecting behavior, allowing students 
to take responsibility for their actions and 
demonstrate self-control through good 
decision-making practices.At the beginning of the school year, each 
family is provided a parent handbook 
which outlines school policies, safety 
rules, and behavior expectations. Teachers 
provide parents a copy of their classroom management plans. During the first week 
of school and in the spring, grade level 
assemblies are presented by administrators 
to revisit behavior expectations and school 
rules as part of their back-to-school 
orientation process. Throughout the year, at 
parent conferences and in class discussions, 
school staff remind students as needed to 
conduct themselves in a safe, responsible, 
and respectful manner.
Progressive disciplinary measures begin in 
the classroom when students are disruptive 
or demonstrating poor citizenship. Teachers 
have found that brief time-outs, loss of 
recess, and parent contact resolve most 
behavioral issues. Students who continue to 
make poor choices in conduct are referred 
to the counselor or assistant principal for 
further intervention and other means of 
correction. Consequences and disciplinary 
action are based upon the student™s past 
behavioral trend and severity of infraction. 
Discipline measures are consistently applied 
in a fair and firm manner.

EVELOPMENT

activities at Lennox School District are being 
aligned to the California State Standards. 
Staff development concentrations are 
selected and identified based on staff survey 
results, California State Standards, state 
and federal grant requirements, and student 
performance data. Teachers have agreed, as 
part of their contract, to acquire professional 
development on their own time to better 
serve their students. Therefore, district and 
site-based staff development offerings are 
highly specialized and focus on the current 
needs of the district™s learning community.
