By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 

 
Mission: The mission of Planada Elementary School is to help students to become: High academic achievers 
Respectful and responsible individuals Cooperative and independent learners Critical thinkers and problem
-
solvers.
 
Vision: Together with fam
ily and community, all students at Planada Elementary School will reach their highest academic 
potential and become responsible, productive citizens in a multicultural, global society.
 
 
Planada Elementary School provides a positive and safe 
learning environment where all students are given equal 
opportunity to achieve maximum growth academically, socially and physically according to state and district guidelines. It 
is our belief that every child can be successful and the goal of the faculty 
and staff is to prepare our students for middle 
school and beyond. We work hard to help our students achieve academic success and we believe in celebrating the cultural 
diversity of our students. The goals we have established to achieve our vision are: 1) 
keeping students as our main focus, 
2) school staff working collaboratively to support student learning and success and 3) involving parents in the education 
process for the success of their children. Our school is proud to offer a growing Dual Language pr
ogram in Spanish and 
English. Our program is currently serving Kindergarten and First grades, and adding a grade level each year. In addition, 
we also have a strong intervention program that provides support to all of our Kindergarten and First grade stude
nts in 
reading skills needed to be successful throughout their years here. 
 
 
The Planada School District is located in the unincorporated city of Planada, California. It is a small rural community with 
a population of about 4,500. Planada is located 9 mile
s east of the city of Merced on State Highway 140, a primary route 
for tourist heading to Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada. Planada Elementary School is one of two schools in 
the Planada Elementary School District. During the 2019
-
2020 school y
ear, 587 students were enrolled at the Planada 
Elementary School in the grades Transitional Kinder through fifth. The student population consists of 64.5% English 
Language Learners and 95.4% socioeconomically disadvantaged. Planada Elementary offers a free
 
breakfast and lunch 
program. Our elementary school students feed into our middle school Cesar E. Chavez. All of our students will eventually 
attend Le Grand High School which is located approximately 6 miles south of Planada. Our hope is that our students
 
will 
leave Planada Elementary with the skills needed to continue their academic success at the middle school. Our ultimate 
academic goal for all of our students is to ensure they have the needed skills to attend Merced Jr. College, which is located
 
Merced
 
and/or the new UC Merced campus which is located 15 miles to the east.

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
The Planada Elementary School District continues to receive tremendous amount of parent and community support. The 
district and sites continue to provide parents with multiple opportunities to engage in conversations about the Local 
Control Funding Formula and Local Control Accountability Plan. The district values parents input/suggestions and we 
routinely hold parent/stakeholder meetings at the various sites in both English and Spanish. Planada Elementary School 
site acknowledges tha
t parents play an integral part in the success of all students and the school, and continually provides 
parents with information as to how best support student learning and success.
 
 
Planada Elementary School has several parent clubs and/or committees. the
 
Booster Club is very active in volunteer work, 
fundraising, parent education, and child advocacy. The School Site Council (SSC) meets monthly and reviews/updates the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, as needed, to reflect that funds are maximized to be
st meet the needs of all school 
programs. The English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC) meets at least quarterly to bring suggestions to the SSC to 
ensure that the needs of English Learners are met. Two members from our ELAC committee serve as representati
ves at 
our District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) monthly meetings. We also hold several parent workshops such 
a; EdTech workshops, English Language Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC) workshops, English Learners 
support, Positive Be
havior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) parent trainings, Dual Language Instruction (DLI) Family 
LIteracy Night and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) Parents and Community informational meetings.
 
 
The school district also works collaboratively 
with the Human Services Agency and the Merced County Office of Education 
to provide additional parent support/training on using positive behavior (PBIS) techniques. The school sends out 
messages, on the school's outreach system or notices, in regards to up
coming events so that parents are informed of the 
various activities taking place at the school site.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Built in 1951, Planada Elementary School offers a safe and secure campus for students, staff, and visitors. Currently 
Planada Elementary School consist of 38 classrooms, a library, a multipurpose room/cafeteria, a
 
front office, a staff room, 
three playgrounds, ball fields and a track, all which are enclosed.The district and county of Merced continue to create a 
safe route to school. In the past, work was done to re
-
configuring the front area of the school campus to
 
make walking to 
and from school much safer for all students and parents. These changes included a drop
-
off/ pick
-
up area for students, a 
four
-
way stop and several pedestrian crossings along the front of the school. A comprehensive school safety plan is in
 
place to ensure a secure, peaceful and clean environment for the school community. The plan is reviewed annually by the 
Safety Committee. Key elements to the Safety Plan are emergency procedures, campus security, and visitor policies.
 
 
The school's disast
er preparedness plan identifies procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Fire 
safety drills are conducted monthly and LockDowns are conducted quarterly at the site. At Planada Elementary School 
every effort is made to ensure students 
are monitored while on campus. Throughout the school day, teachers, 
administration, and lunch duty supervisors are responsible for supervising students before and after school, at recess and 
during lunch. All visitors and volunteers are required to sign in
/out at the school office and state their reason for being on 
campus. All visitors must wear a visitor's pass at all times.

The Planada Elementary School District allotted 2 days as non
-
instructional days. These 4 days are used to provide all staff 
with professional development on various topics. These topics included: PBIS Training, Common Core State Standards, 
NGSS, math, Tec
hnology, Lesson and Unit Design, Best Teaching Practices, English Learner Strategies, Smarter Balanced 
Assessment, DIBELS, Renaissance Learning Programs, and aligning current school adoptions to Common Core. 
Additionally, the Planada Elementary School allo
cates every Wednesday as an early release day. These Wednesdays are 
used for additional Professional Development training and for teacher collaboration, reviewing student data or other site
-
specific PD centered on student/school improvement. The school als
o provides release time for staff to participate in 
professional development events during the school year. Many of Planada Elementary School's teachers also choose to 
participate in professional development outside of their workday.
 
 
All of the Profession
al Development training and events are centered on providing teachers with additional resources 
which will lead to improved student achievement and closing the achievement gap. As we continue to fully transition to 
Common Core State Standards and the Smart
er Balanced Assessment Consortium, teachers are provided with on
-
going 
professional development. The district remains committed to providing all staff with the PD and support to ease the 
transition to the Common Core, providing all students with access to 
technology, providing teachers with support to 
embed technology into their teaching and providing ALL students with a rigorous academic program that will prepare 
them with the tools necessary to succeed.
