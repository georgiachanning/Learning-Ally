A Message From The Principal 
Dear Moffett Mountain Lions Family, my 
name is Oscar Cisneros, and I am honored 
to return for my sixth year as the principal at 
Moffett Elementary School. I look forward to 
continuing our work in building a partnership 
with you. Together we can ensure that our 
children receive the quality educational 
program that will prepare them to move on 
to middle school, graduate from high school, 
and to eventually have a successful college 
and career experience. I am excited about 
our ongoing implementation (now in our 
second year) of The Leader in Me, which 
is a whole school transformation process. 
It teaches 21st century leadership and life 
skills to students and creates a culture of 
student empowerment based on the idea 
that every child can be a leader. Let™s work 
together to instill a sense of pride in this 
community as we preserve a solid tradition 
of pursuing excellence. I know that we have 
the right mix of students, parents, and staff 
to make this a successful year. On behalf 
of this great school community I want to 
encourage everyone to work together to 
support our students in a positive, nurturing, 
and dignified family environment.Sincerely,
Oscar CisnerosDISTRICT

strategically located on campus to 
monitor student activities. During recess, 
teachers monitor student behavior on the 
playground. During the lunch recess, the 
principal, counselor, and yard supervision 
aides monitor students in the cafeteria and

dismissed at the end of the day, teachers 
escort their classes to the main exit and 
remain at the gate until all students have

 LEARNING
At Moffett Elementary, all staff believe that a safe learning environment is an effective 
learning environment. Schoolwide discipline policies are founded upon the district™s 
assertive discipline model which clearly defines unacceptable behavior and consequences 
for poor conduct.  Teachers have established individual, grade appropriate classroom 
management plans in accordance with assertive discipline policies. Concentration is 
placed in redirecting behavior, allowing students to take responsibility for their actions and 
demonstrate self-control through good decision-making practices.At the beginning of the school year, each family is provided a parent handbook which 
outlines school policies, safety rules, and behavior expectations. Teachers provide parents 
a copy of their classroom management plans and discipline policies. During the first week 
of school, teachers reinforce behavior expectations and school rules as part of their back-to-school orientation process. Throughout the year, during classroom discussions and at 
school assemblies, the principal reinforces the importance of following school rules and 
reminds students to conduct themselves in a safe, responsible, and respectful manner.   
Teachers integrate OLWEUS and The Leader In Me (7 Habits of Highly Effective People) 
Program strategies to promote respect and responsibility through daily instruction and 
activities. Special assemblies are held to present the Leader In Me (Program to provide 
students with the support and strategies to manage difficult situations. 
Progressive disciplinary measures begin in 
the classroom when students are disruptive 
or demonstrating poor citizenship. Students 
who continue to make poor choices in 
conduct are referred to the principal or 
counselor. Consequences and disciplinary 
action are based upon the student™s past 
behavioral trend and severity of infraction. 
Discipline measures are consistently applied 
in a fair and firm manner and are dealt 
with by the counselor, assistant principal, 
and principal. Moffett Elementary provides 
student group counseling three times per 
week for 25 minutes on a five week cycle 
based upon teacher referrals.CLA

Staff development concentrations are 
selected and identified based on staff 
survey results, California State Standards, 
federal and state grant requirements, and 
student performance data. Teachers have 
agreed, as part of their contract, to acquire 
professional development on their own time 
to better serve their students. Therefore, 
district and site-based staff development 
offerings are highly specialized and focus 
on the current needs of the district™s learning 
community.
During the 2018-19 school year, Moffett 
Elementary School staff participated in

TAFF
Moffett Elementary School provides 
professional, highly qualified staff that provide 
additional services and support centered on 
the whole student academically, physically, 
and mentally. The Counseling and Support 
Services table in this report illustrates the 
availability of non-instructional support staff 
to Moffett Elementary™s students. Full-time 
equivalent (FTE) is a standard measurement 
used to identify an employee™s regular work 
load on a weekly basis. For example, an FTE 
of 1.0 designates a full-time position and the 
employee is on campus and available all 
day every day of the week; an FTE of 0.5 
indicates that the staff member is available 
and on campus a portion (50%) of the week.˜˚˛˝˚˙˝
