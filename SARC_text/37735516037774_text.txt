School Description
 

 
we have one! Not only 
can you see the ocean from our various playgrounds and some classrooms, you can see it painted on the 
spectacular murals that decorate the campus walls. The staff, families, and students who are part of the Buena 
Vista family have a 
beautiful and realistic view of our school as a representation of everything that is Southern 
California. We have diversity, a rich history, and an educational program that emphasizes the basics, as well 
as a plethora of enrichment activities. Like Souther
n California, we have it all.
 
 
At Buena Vista we view ourselves as high achievers, and we do everything we can to provide a well
-
planned, 
organized, and stimulating curriculum for our students. We have a diverse population that benefits 
tremendously from t
he many programs we offer to support student learning. Program interventions include 
a learning center for identified special education students, intervention tutors who work in the classrooms to 
support struggling students, PE teacher, and Art teacher. St
udent engagement is a key component of each 

 
 
We focus on a global environmental awareness during our TK through fifth grade EARTHITUDE program which 
incorporates experiences that encourage students to reduce their environment
al impact, improve their health 
and wellness, and participate in environmental and sustainability education.  Students engage in gardening, 
field trips to our local flower fields, lagoons, and ocean, weekly Mileage Club and Workout Wednesday, Plastic 
Free 
Tuesday, and recycling.  We sort our trash during lunches and have Friday recycling manned by our fifth 
grade students.  Our teachers are all skilled in Project Based Learning and utilize their skills to engage and 
challenge students.  Our Open House is he
ld near Earth Day.  At that event our hard work and efforts toward 
Earth study and environmentalism is showcased.
 
 
We have an active PTA and School Site Council (SSC) who support the needs of our students both academically 
and socially through fund
-
raising
 
and sharp decision
-
making. The PTA runs fund
-
raisers to support our art and 
PE programs, evening events, and assemblies. Some of our social events put on by the PTA are our Pancake 
Breakfast, Holiday Hootenanny, Family Art Night,BV Campout, and Dinner Nig
hts at local restaurants.

Types of Services Funded
 
The District believes in "Best First Instruction," which means each teacher is accountable for the learning needs 
of the students in their class, teachers differentiate bas
ed on these learning needs and they collaborate with 
grade level team teachers as well as the principal to ensure students progress at every level.  Beyond the 
general education classroom, schools have Learning Center support, and depending upon the site, 
Special Day 
Classrooms, Guide counseling, and School Counselors.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, 
enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a 
workstation, and the ability to print documents.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Pla
nned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school is not in good repair, according to the criteria established by the Office of Public School Construction. Some of 
our
 
deficiencies are critical, or 
may be widespread. Maintenance or minor repairs are required in several areas. We scored between 75 and 90 percent on the 15 
categories of our 
evaluation.
 
We added three murals over the past calendar year (EARTHITUDE, Charact
er Tree, and Youths in Action in our auditorium.  A number of outdoor areas 
were upgraded with drought tolerant plantings in keeping with our environmentalism focus.  Backpack hooks and a lost and foun
d area were created to 
assist students with school item
 
maintenance.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASP
P] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eig
ht and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant 
cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or 
programs of study

mandatory is funnele

ff to 

y of other ways, formally 
and informally. These include volunteering in the classroom, supporting our Earthitude Program (school garden, chicken coop, 
Workout Wednesdays), 
running our BV Campout, Holiday Hootenanny, Spring Family Dance, and our Jogathon, c
oordinating fund

School Safety Plan
 
We re
vise and update our school safety plan each year in the fall. Our current school safety plan meets all federal, state, and di
strict standards for a 
comprehensive school safety plan. It addresses prevention, planning, responding, and recovering from possibl
e threats (earthquakes, intruders,  fires) to 
ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors. Our psychologists, and site administrators are extensively trained in thr
eat assessment techniques by 
nationally recognized experts in school
-
threat assessmen
t. To ensure safety on our campus, a school site safety committee conducts inspections to 
identify potential hazards. We have also developed a disaster preparedness plan, and we conduct regular fire and earthquake d
rills to familiarize staff 
and students w

 
landscaping 
are maintained at a high standard for student safety and undergo regular inspections. A new visitor check
-
in system is
 
being implemented, requiring all 
visitors to sign in and out.
