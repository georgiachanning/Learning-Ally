Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

student population consists of approximately 533 students in preschool through fifth grade. We qualify for school wide 
Title I funding through the Consolidated Application. We currently serve English Learners, Gifted and 
Talented, Migrant, 
Emergency Immigrant, and Special Education students. 
 
 
Our school mission is to provide a quality education by ensuring that each student is known and appreciated as an 
individual. Within a safe and orderly environment, students will be 
encouraged to strive for high levels of academic 
achievement and become productive members of our culturally diverse community.
 
 
To achieve our school mission and to meet accountability targets, we have implemented the following goals:
 

 
Every child will be 
a proficient and independent reader by the end of third grade.
 

 
English Learners will be equipped with the English language skills needed for academic success through daily 
English Language Development.
 

 
Every child will meet mathematics and language arts 
grade
-
level standards.
 

 
Integrate technology to enhance standards
-
based instruction.
 

 
Provide early intervention for students who have not mastered grade
-
level standards which include in
-
class 
modifications, after
-
school academic programs and summer school.
 

 
Provide sustained professional development and coaching focused on teaching and learning and core academic 
subjects. Training is aligned with the state curriculum frameworks and district
-
adopted standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
Julien G. Hathaway School was opened 
in 1962 as the ninth school in the Hueneme Elementary School District. It was one 

networked computers in all rooms and offices, and attractiv
e and comfortable classroom interiors. Recently we added a 
state of the art STEAM lab that replaced the old computer lab.  Students in grades 2
-
5 have one to one devices and students 
in grades K
-
1 have 10 devices in their classrooms. There are 34 classroom
s at Hathaway and a new portable restroom 
building was added to accommodate the new preschool classrooms.  Julien Hathaway's office was recently remodeled to 
make the office more modern, functional and safe. Secure doors were added at the front entrance as
 
well as in the office 
to ensure student and staff safety.  A handicap ramp was added to the front entrance as well new ADA compliant drinking 
fountains were added in 2019.

Our day, two night custodians, and an additional 4 hour custodian clean classrooms
 
on a daily basis. Routine maintenance 
is also done daily. The condition of our restrooms, floors, walls, roof, plumbing and electrical systems is consistently 
maintained and upgraded as needed. Litter and graffiti are dealt with immediately with the help 
of students, the 
custodians, and the groundskeeper. Together, school and district personnel work to ensure that the facility is maintained 
in a manner that ensures it is clean, safe and functional as determined pursuant to an interim evaluation instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

Date of Last Review/Update:     November 12, 2019
 
Date Last Discussed with Staff:  November 18, 2019
 
 
The Hueneme Board of Education has directed that schools be prepared for any actual or 
anticipated disaster. Hathaway 
School has a Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan (available in the school office) which meets district and state 
requirements. Monitored and reviewed annually by the School Safety Committee comprised of administrators, teac
hers, 
parents and students, the plan outlines rules and procedures governing safety issues at the school. The safety plan includes 
disaster procedures, procedures for safe entry and exit of students, procedures for serious disciplinary problems, a sexual 
h
arassment policy, child abuse reporting procedures, school dress codes, and school discipline policies. Safety procedures 
and elements of the Comprehensive School Safety Plan are reviewed with school staff at the start of each school year.
 
 
Other factors p
romoting school safety include regular fire and earthquake drills, campus supervision, many CPR
-
certified 
staff members, and a well
-
planned communication system. Classrooms are equipped with first aid kits and fire 
extinguishers. We strive to maintain a sa
fe and orderly school campus that supports a strong academic climate.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and 
Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals participate in professional development focused on the California 
Common Core State Standards in order to improve their skills in teaching and assessment of student learning. The 
primary 
focus areas are instruction of grade
-
level content standards, intervention strategies for students who have not mastered 
standards, and assessment of student progress. 
 
 
The primary area of focus for the most recent three
-
year period was:
 

 
English L
anguage Arts
 

 
English Language Development
 

 
Writing
 

 
Mathematics
 

 
C.H.A.M.P.S. Program (Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement, Participation, Successful Students)
 
Professional development is offered during the teaching day, on three student
-
free staff develop
ment days, during 
summer institutes, after school, and on weekends. Substitute teachers are provided and the negotiated hourly rate is 
offered for attendance.
 
 
During the school year, teachers are supported by classroom observations, staff meetings, and gr
ade
-
level/content area 
collaboration. Professional learning agendas are based on student achievement data and teacher input. In 
reading/language arts and mathematics, student performance data is ongoing and evaluated using a common assessment. 
A Student Pr
ogress Report aligned to the California Common Core State Standards is sent to parents at the end of each 
trimester.
