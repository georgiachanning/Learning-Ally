About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC con
tains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

re classrooms and campus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenance and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order sys
tem enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance need
s, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenance projects are 

ither by the school custodian 
or 
district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and wit
h the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian c
ommunicate daily to discuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and principal inspect facilities for safety haza
rds, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff en


 
procedures, use of 
chemicals, and us
e of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards and prioritization 
procedures 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilit
ies well stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas, and restrooms. Groundskee
pers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sp
orts fields, and irrigation systems.

School Safety 
Plan
 
The Comprehensive School Site Safety Plan (CSSP) was developed in collaboration with law enforcement and the District Office 
to fulfill Senate Bill 187 
requirements.  The CSSP is managed by the District via Doc
-

n is reviewed and updated to address  safety, security  
and emergency preparedness.   Schools are required to review and update their Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP) with th
eir School Site Councils 
and/or Safety Committees. Each school also meets w
ith Santa Ana Unified School Police annually to discuss egress/ingress, crime data and other factors 
related to Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).
 
 

ty committee, consider student wellness and health, along with 
academic achievement, to be top priorities.  In addition to our principal and TOSA, the school employs a nurse, a psychologis
t, a part
-
time psychologist 
for student group intervention and full 
time speech teacher, to help support students and their families.  We participate in Red Ribbon Week and Cyber 
Savvy Week during the months of October and December.  All staff is in
-
serviced in Child Abuse Awareness and reporting, Bullying, Sexual Harassme
nt 
and Appropriate Use of Technology each year. Fremont is also supported by an after school program, Engage 360, that is open b
efore school at 6:30 a.m. 
and after school until 5:30 p.m. every day.
 
 
School rules for safety are explained to students by teac
hers in the classroom, by administration during morning opening assemblies on Fridays, and 
through PBIS behavior expectation rotations to different locations on the campus throughout the year.  Classroom rules and ex
pectations are explained 
to students in 
each classroom at the beginning of the year, are communicated to parents at the beginning of the year, and are posted in each
 
classroom.  

l development at parent 
conferences, in grade level parent meetings, and in Student Success Team meetings.  When students do not follow school rules,
 
progressive discipline 
procedures are followed.  Misbehavior is not tolerated, and is dealt with positivel
y yet firmly, consistently, and fairly to the extent necessary to ensure a 
safe and positive learning environment in the classroom and on campus.  All of this works to support the safety and socio
-
emotional wellness of all 
students.
 
 
Disaster preparedness 
is an on
-
going effort at Fremont.  We have monthly drills of various types, including fire, earthquake and lockdowns, in case of an 
intruder/active shooter on campus.  A school emergency plan has been developed, (this plan is reviewed by School Site Counci
l at the beginning of each 
calendar year)  and maps for evacuation are posted in all classrooms. Every classroom has an emergency backpack, extra class 
rosters, and accountability 
forms which are at the ready for all drills and in case of any real emergenc
ies.  Office staff and the nurses office has designated carts already supplied 
with all student emergency information as well as forms for checking out students to parents, and any medications and first a
ide supplies needed in case 
of a real emergency.  Te
achers and staff are partnered with at least one other teacher and teams of teachers are ready and trained to perform tasks o
n 
the medical team, the team that sweeps the building for the injured, the student reunification team, as well as the command p
ost 
team.  Areas of need 
and concerns about drills and procedures are reviewed and discussed on an on
-
going basis through our monthly Safety Committee meetings.
 
 
All members of the Fremont Elementary family are committed to this safety plan in order to make ou
r school a safe place for our students, staff and 
community members to learn, work and grow.
