Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents play a vital role at New Brighton Middle School.  There are many opportunities for parent participation.  Formal 
opportunities include participation in the New Brighton Middle School (NBMS) H
ome and School Club, School Site Council, 
and the English Learners Advisory Council.  The NBMS Home and School Club maintain a website to help parents stay 
informed of events that are happening at NBMS.  They also maintain a volunteer list and contact pare
nts when they are 
needed to assist with special events e.g. fundraising activities, school photographs etc.  The Athletic Director meets with 
sport participant parents to inform them of team schedules and how they can be involved in supporting the various 
NBMS 
teams.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school district is a small district with approximately 2,000 students.   Therefore, all schools are covered by a district
 
wide 
Safe Schools Plan. This plan stresses emergency preparation and was developed in conjunction with law enforcement 
and county emergency services.  All buildings housing students meet Field Act standards.  The Fire Department and the 
district inspect facilit
ies annually.

Over the past three years our district has spent a great deal of professional learning on positive behavior intervention 
support (PBIS), social emotional academic development (SEAD), and multi
-
tiered
 
systems of support (MTSS). In 2016
-
2017, 
district administration including the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services, Director of Student 
Services and two principals participated in eight days of implementation training for Mult
i
-
Tiered System of Supports, 
MTSS.  From this professional development, and through a specialized grant, the district is participating in a second year 
of PBIS support at two schools, Soquel and Santa Cruz Gardens Elementary Schools. Leadership teams from 
each of these 
site are comprised of the principal, teachers, campus supervisors and parents. These teams are in initial implementation 
and data collection phases. PBIS is the continued work at each school site, as is SEAD, which include alternative means o
f 
correction, RULER, mindfulness, classroom charters and more.
 
 
Some development by content/subject are as follows:

group to learn about NGSS and look at materials adoption. Most recently, Soquel Union Elementary has
 
partnered with 
BAY SCI to further science and NGSS throughout our district. Through this partnership, a new science mission has been 
developed and communicated, a timeline has been created, a science leadership team has formed, regular leadership 
meetings
 
are held

per year on non

-
led 
development, grade level collaboration, or school
-
focused meeting time.  And bec
ause the needs of each site and teacher 
team differ, an additional several days are set aside for local
-
 
interest professional development.
