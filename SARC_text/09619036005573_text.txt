By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Tahoe Valley Elementary School is located in a year
-
round mountainous, rural resort town
. The school itself is located in 

Tahoe converge. Tahoe Valley maintains an enrollment for Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through 5th grade o
f 
approximately 427 students and enjoys a diverse ethnic composition. Tahoe Valley Elementary School houses the Early 
Childhood Learning Center (ECLC). It is a school within a school and contains all of the district TK classrooms. The economic
 
base of the 
school is diverse with some students living on the lake shore in Tahoe Keys homes and others living in quiet 
neighborhoods, apartments, motels, trailer parks, and low
-
income housing. 
 

 
Approximately 288 (67%) of our students qualify for free or reduced meal
s.
 

 
Approximately 95 (22%) of our students are identified as English Language Learners.
 

 
Approximately 187 (44%) of our students are identified as Hispanic or Latino.
 

 
Approximately 185 (43%) of our students are identified as White.
 

 
Approximately 50 (12%) of 
our students are identified as other ethnic backgrounds or multi
-
ethnic.
 

 
Approximately 46 (11%) of our students are identified as Students with Disabilities.
 

 
Approximately 45 (11%) of our students are identified as Homeless
 

 
Approximately 5 (1%) of our 
students are identified as Foster Youth
 

 
Full
-
Day Kindergarten has been implemented since 2006 and Transitional Kindergarten (modified day schedule
-
4 hours) has been implemented since 2012.
 

 
Tahoe Valley has three intervention teachers who serve all TK
-
5 stu
dents during school hours. This support is 
flexible, based upon data results, and differentiates to meet the diverse needs of the students. Our goal is that 
EVERY child leave Tahoe Valley at or above grade level in all content areas.
 

 
3A, our afterschool "A
cademic Academy" supports students in math and reading throughout the year. This 
program is run by credentialed teachers and targets students below grade level.
 

 
Tahoe Valley has implemented Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) as the focus for the school. Stu
dents attend 
weekly choral/instrumental instruction along with P.E./Dance instruction both taught by credentialed teachers. 
Every year students in grades 1
-
5 also have the option of performing in a public musical performance. This year 
we are implementing 
general music theory instruction for all students in TK through 5th grade along with 
instrumental instruction (Drumming to TK
-
K; Boomwhackers to 1st; Handbells to 2nd; Recorders to 3; and 
Ukuleles to 4th and 5th grade students). We wrote a grant this year 
and are hoping to add piano instruction for 
5th grade to the overall program. Grant funding also provides acrylic canvas painting lessons for grades 1
-
5 
through a partnership with our local Paint & Sip studio.
 

 
Tahoe Valley designed and implemented a STEAM 
Lab which is coordinated by an Instructional Assistant. 
Classes can attend weekly labs and robotics lessons with all students attending a minimum of twice each month. 
All lessons are tied to NGSS grade
-
level standards. We have also partnered with Get in th
e Act! Science and 
Drama Theater to provide a VAPA approach to some Science content for grades K
-
3. This program is provided 
through grant funding.
 
Tahoe Valley Elementary's Mission Statement: 
 
Our mission is to provide children with learning experiences t
hat will enable them to:
 

 
Develop Character, Creativity, Critical thinking, Communication and Collaboration skills
 

 
Appreciate the aesthetic values in the Creative and Performing Arts

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The school and grounds are well kept and inviting.  Proper attention is given to facility upkeep, with a 
regular maintenance 
schedule. Within the last 20 years, the school was modernized with a $1.5 million upgrade to the entire facility.  Nine 

 
adequacy have been successful. During the summer of 2014, the entire school interior and exterior were repainted, all 
classrooms received new flooring and the exterior of the building was repaired as needed.  Additional playground 
equipment and a new bloc
k retaining wall was added in 2016 which replaced the broken wooden one. The front entrance 
(windows and doors) were replaced at that time which also enhanced the overall appearance of the school. Tahoe Valley 
had additional repairs and upgrades completed 
by the beginning of the 2017
-
18 school year.  These improvements 
included additional playground equipment in the TK/Kindergarten playground, a new grass field on the upper playground, 
new dishwasher, and new drinking fountains/bottle filling stations aroun
d the campus. Last year we painted the last of 
the relocatable's interiors and the new Performing Arts Center.  New flooring was installed in the last portables along with 
adding a new washer and dryer system for use by the school and families. The tables 
and benches in the MPR were also 
just upgraded, repaired and new tops installed.  Over the summer the School District and the California Conservation Corp 
removed dead and diseased trees, or trees which were too close to the buildings and campus to help re
duce potential fire 
hazard.  The site principal and senior custodian meet weekly to communicate needs as well as repairs needed and 
completed. The district is aware of the need for blacktop replacement and/or repair on the playground and has added this 
to 
the district's long
-
term plan for funding prioritization.
 
 
School safety is a top priority, and Tahoe Valley's Safe School Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan guide both 
prevention and practice. Site safety meetings are held at the site before and after 
each emergency drill. The site maintains 
a trained Incident Management Team and responds to emergencies according to the Incident Command System as per 

Plan and 
Action Plan is updated regularly and communicates with the public through the Aeries Communications phone, email, and 
text contact system.  The school and district work in partnership with local and state law enforcement and fire agencies 
in addit
ion to agencies in the public and private sectors to ensure safe and peaceful schools.  This year we are completing 
the installation of our new exterior and interior camera system along with a large screen supervised monitor so the campus 
can be supervised
 
easily for early emergency and event notification and action.

The school is well maintained, clean, safe, and provides a positive atmosphere for learning to take place. The school is 
seen by all to be a safe and orderly environment. The head custodian ha
s greatly increased the cleanliness and safety of 
our campus and communicates regularly with the administration on areas of need and completed updates. Regular school 
safety, evacuation, shelter
-
in
-
place, and lock
-
down drills reinforce our safety preparedn
ess procedures that are reviewed 
with all students and staff. Campus supervision is provided by teachers, classified personnel, and the administrator.  The 
entire staff just completed "Stop the Bleed" training given by the local hospital and now has a Trau
ma Kit on campus along 
with an AED located at the front entrance.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

calculated by taking the total number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who 
met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total numbe
r of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student
 
privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. T
he achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Tahoe Valley school provides a school culture of openness and is welcoming to parents and the community. Our doors are 
open for parents to visit and/or volunteer. Our PTA and Cafecitos parent meetings encourage parents to become involved 
in many of our act
ivities and fund raisers. Our automated Aeries phone message system, text, and email systems deliver 
messages to parents to keep them informed of important school issues in both English and Spanish. Tahoe Valley also 
hosts both a school website and electro
nic message sign which is constantly updated and viewed as an up
-
to
-
date method 
of communication for school events, volunteer opportunities, and information. Twice a year parents formally meet with 
teachers to keep informed of their student's progress. Inf
ormally teachers are in continual communication with parents 
through a variety of means.  Parents and families are encouraged to participate in the PTA and School Site Council 
meetings, along with ELAC and Cafecitos meetings. These groups help provide a vo
ice for parents and a means to be 
actively involved in the mission of the school. Tahoe Valley also distributes Chromebook computers to all students in the 
3rd, 4th and 5th grades. Students take these wireless
-
capable computers home to access their own sch
ool's websites and 
to offer themselves and their parents web
-
based communication with their teachers and classmates, along with extended 
time to work on intervention programs to strengthen their academic skills.  Students in Transitional Kindergarten throu
gh 
2nd grade have access to Chromebooks within their classroom daily for intervention and support.  Tahoe Valley views 
parents as equal partners in the educational progress and support for every child.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan is updated each year in the fall to address current school and facilities issues with input from all o
f 
our Stakeholders. The plan identifies areas of need for the facility and looks at the on
-
going safety up
-
keep of the school 
site.
 
The plan also reviews the safety procedures in place in case of an emergency. An Emergency Action Plan is updated 
yearly and in place and safety drills are held monthly. The school has an active Safety Committee which meets monthly to 
monitor, update, and
 
brainstorm next steps for improving our school
-
wide safety needs. We review, evaluate, and modify 
throughout the year our dismissal and public sign
-
in systems to insure we are efficient and meeting the needs of a rapidly 
changing safety culture. This year
 
we will be completing the installation of an exterior and interior camera system with a 
large screen supervised monitor for easy monitoring of activities around the campus.  This will greatly enhance our early 
warning system for events and/or emergencies.
  
Tahoe Valley is always on the forefront in looking at ways to enhance our 
safety systems around the campus.  Besides the camera monitoring system, we have locked entrances, gates, and all other 
access points, added peepholes into classroom doors, install
ed door securing devices, and work with our local fire marshall 
to make sure we are in compliance with all requirements for minimizing fire hazards.  Our number one guiding principle 
is "Safety First" both with our facilities and with school climate.

With the introduction of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Lake Tahoe Unified School District devoted the 
majority of the CCSS funding from the state previously for two years to professional development along 
with Educator 
Effectiveness Funding.  As additional funding became available, LTUSD was and is committed to the ongoing professional 
development of the teachers and staff.  The necessary professional development has been identified by both the 
administrati
on and the staff with an emphasis on developing a deeper understanding of the shifts to instruction and 
assessment that CCSS is calling for, along with the needed changes to teaching strategies to prepare students for 21st 
century skills.  The focus of the
 
professional development is a process which is constantly being evaluated and re
-
evaluated 
as new information is uncovered including the use of student data.  Every teacher has the opportunity to self
-
select areas 
for additional focus and develop a plan f
or implementation. So far this year, the major focus of our site professional 
development has centered on implementation of our new Social Studies program, Step Up To Writing and our new Drop 
Everything and Writing program, RTI, Positive Behavioral Interve
ntions and Supports (PBIS), the integration of the Arts 
into core curriculum, AVID training, how to work with students of poverty, Stop the Bleed trauma training, and specific 
technology and assessment trainings, etc.
 
 
The professional development model we
 
are utilizing is providing time both during school hours for in
-
depth CCSS training 
and collaboration and program implementation, or after school hours depending upon the individual training and/or 
teacher needs. These meetings are either site
-
based or di
strict
-
wide grade
-
level teams with specific outcomes all focused 
on deepening the implementation of the CCSS and differentiating instruction.  Some staff members also attend out
-
of
-
area conferences and trainings depending upon the individual needs of the t
eacher. So far this year, teachers and staff 
have attended Social Studies training and implementation, informational trainings on how to enhance and modify our 
current practices to be more effective for our students, technology trainings to increase teache
r efficacy with the data 
management system and new online technology programs and supports, new assessment systems (ESGI), AVID school
-
wide trainings, Trauma
-
Informed best practices, PBIS, and Stop the Bleed trauma training. We are sending teachers to 
Step
 
Up To Writing training through El Dorado County Office of Education later this month. This is the first wave of getting 
the staff trained on this system which directly ties to the district's Differentiated Assistance plan. The principal has also
 
provided 
release time for new teachers to a grade level to attend in
-
class coaching and peer observations to enhance their 
efficacy.  Lake Tahoe Unified School District also provides one full day of staff development at the beginning of each school
 
year. Overall, i
n 2017
-
18, out of the 22 PD days, 17 were partial days; in 2018
-
19, out of the 18 PD days, 12 were partial 
days; and for 2019
-
2020, we will have approximately 17 partial days of PD.

The district and school site use a PLC (Professional Learning Community) 
model of support along with providing training 
through attendance at various conferences and workshops. The staff is also supported by the principal who is trained in 
Cognitive Coaching, Adaptive Schools, Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) K
-
3, an
d has been a professional 
staff developer for the state of California. The staff uses student performance data along with informal assessments to 
monitor the implementation of the CCSS and student achievement. The principal and Reading Intervention 
Teacher
s/Coaches work with the paraprofessionals and provide training in Language Arts supplemental processes. The 
Instructional Coach also works with specific teachers and classrooms to help support and deepen the practices and 
strategies used to meet the needs 
of the individual students.  The principal has also held Book Studies afterschool hours.  
Teachers who sign up are given the professional development book and the group meets throughout the year to read a 
chapter at a time, and reflect as a group on the ne
w learnings and how to apply it directly into their classrooms.
