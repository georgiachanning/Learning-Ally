By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
MISSION, VISION AND VALUES STATEMENT
 
Our school's vision is to 
pursue a challenging educational program created in collaboration with our students, parents and 

Madroña Elementary School's mission is to 
focus on all students' academic, social, physical, and psychological growth. Our 
values are defined by the consistent collaboration between our school, families and community.  These relationships help 
us work together and value the whole child and reach o
ur educational goals to meet the academic, social, physical and 
psychological needs of every child.
 
 
SCHOOL DESCRIPTION
 
Madroña Elementary School was built in 1964 and remains a neighborhood school within the surrounding community of 
Thousand Oaks, Califo
rnia. Madroña is home to approximately 410 students and 50 staff members. In the past, Madroña 
Elementary School was recognized as a California Distinguished School due to our excellent standards
-
based academic 
programs. The dedication of the staff at Madr
oña is evidenced through the high level of academic instruction, extension 
activities and multi
-
tiered system of intervention and supports offered to all students at all grade levels.  Madroña also 
continues to promote a school wide focus on positive behav
ior supports through the CHAMPs Program.
 
 
At Madroña all students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of intervention and enrichment programs during 
the school day.  Enrichment programs include a focus on art, music, engineering and computer t
echnology. In addition, 
students who are identified as Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) receive differentiated instruction within the 
classroom setting through the school day.  GATE students are also able to participate in after school enrichment activ
ities 
once a month on campus and district wide monthly activities.  To ensure all students are given the ability to learn in high 
interest areas as well as core academics Madroña employs several teacher specialists part
-
time.  A Technology Specialist 
teach
er works with students to utilizes web
-
based platforms such as Google and Microsoft, as well as multiple web based 
academic programs to support various learning styles (i.e. Moby Max, IXL, UNIQUE and Raz Kids).   Madroña also offers a 
multilevel system of 
support and intervention.  Through classroom differentiation and the employment of multiple 
Intervention Specialist Teachers we are able to support learning strategies for students from Kindergarten through 5th 
grade and ensure all have access additional s
upports in core reading and math.  These specialists are able to work within 
the curriculum and in partnership with classroom teachers to ensure phonics, reading fluency, reading comprehension, 
number sense and math problem solving are extended or revisite
d for students determined to need further practice.  In 
the fall of 2015, Madroña also evaluated and adjusted the school wide MTSS (Multi
-
Tiered System of Supports) and 
Intervention program.  This new focus of the multi
-
leveled intervention system is to fo
llow the Professional Learning 
Community's (PLCs) model of consistent review of grade level data to address our desire to ensure every student makes 
academic, social, physical and psychological growth.

This year Madroña has grown our enrichment opportunit
ies during the school day through a new Pride Time = ME 
(Madroña Enrichment) Time program.  This redefined Pride Time = ME Time provides high interest learning for all students 
(K
-
5) within their grade level groups.  Staff and stakeholders expressed a desi
re to further explore high interest areas like, 
technology, computer coding, STEAM learning, science, art, music, poetry, and literature.  The belief is these high interest 
topics are a new avenue to reach grade level required skills in reading and math.  
As educators we acknowledge that 
educational needs continue to change and reflect areas of need.  At Madroña we feel the reading and math skills our 
students will need to be successful students should also reflect the skills our students will need to be su
ccessful members 
of our community and society.  We also promote and engage our partners with our community based after school 
programs in the recreation and arts to increase involvement and whole child approaches to learning. These high interest 
and engagi
ng topics and activities explored during Pride Time = Me time and with our community partners is how we seek 
to promote the love of learning, community and personal growth.

Year and month in 
which data were collected:
 
January 2020
 
 
All TK
-
12 students have current standards
-
based textbooks in math, science, history/social science, and English/language 
arts. With each curricular cycle established by the State of California, the Conejo Valley Uni
fied School District (CVUSD) 
Board of Education adopts textbooks within the timeline provided. Standards
-
aligned books for grades 9
-
12 are approved 
locally. Textbooks in grades K
-
8 are selected from lists of books and materials approved by the State Board 
of Education. 
Sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials have been purchased for all students in English, math, 
history/social science, science, health and foreign language. In addition, annually, sites receive specific science 
supple
mentary funds to be used for consumable laboratory expenses and/or equipment.
 
 
The process of selecting textbooks and materials involves the formation of a committee charged with the responsibility of 
reviewing current state standards and frameworks, analy
zing student data, writing courses of study (as required) and 
selecting and maintaining current instructional materials. The goal of such district
-
wide committees comprised of teachers 
and administrators representing all targeted grade levels, is to achiev
e high academic standards for all of our TK
-
12 
students. Each major subject area, such as math, science, history/social science, foreign language and English/language 
arts, is reviewed and adopted under the guidance of the California Department of Educatio
n and State Board of Education. 
The committee submits its recommendations to the Board of Education for final approval. The recommendation to the 
Board includes the basic textbook materials as well as supplementary materials within the subject. On October 
1, 2019, 
the CVUSD Board of Education approved a resolution for the 2019
-
2020 school year declaring that the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District has provided each pupil with sufficient standards
-
based textbooks and instructional materials 
consistent with
 
the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks.

ollowing personnel, inspects each school in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District:  Site Administrator, Director of Maintenance and Operations, Director of Planning and New Construction, 
and the Assistant Superintendent.  A facilities evaluation is com
pleted documenting the condition of the school in a variety 
of areas including the cleanliness of restrooms, condition of roofs, paving and walkways, HVAC systems, landscape 
maintenance, etc.  Any observed condition that represents a threat to the health a
nd safety of students and staff is 
annotated for immediate correction.  Notes include items that could improve the utility, appearance, sustainable

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
