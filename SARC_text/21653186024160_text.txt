About the SARC
 
By February 1
 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Fo
rmula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and lo
cal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the 
school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Ava
ilability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dixie Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on October 9, 2018 and determined that each school within the district
 
had sufficient and good 
quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of William
s vs. the State of California. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education, making the text
books used in the school 
the most current available. Materials approved for use by the
 
State are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by 
a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination
 
at the district office 
prior to adoption. 
The table displays information about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional 
materials used at the school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter

ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3
