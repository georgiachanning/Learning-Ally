About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and 
Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A representative group of teachers and administrators reviews instructional materials. The committee meets
 
for a detailed comprehensive analysis of materials from publishers. The materials must meet a pre

evaluation tool. They are as follows:
 
1. Compliance with Board Policy and Administrative Regulations
 
2. California standards alignment
 
3. Focus on coherence within a grade and across grade levels
 
4. 
Rigor and balance
 
5. Access for all students
 
6. Assessments for progress monitoring and in support of the California assessments
 
7. Support for English language learners
 
8. Support for special populations
 
 
In addition to the items delineated above, the comm
ittee considers digital resources for staff, students and
 
parents to support learning in varied 
environments. The committee reaches a consensus, and the Board of
 
Education makes the final decision on the chosen textbooks upon reviewing the 

mmendation.
