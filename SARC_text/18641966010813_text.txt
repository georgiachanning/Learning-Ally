By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

instructional materials, or both, in each subject that are consistent with the content and cycles of the Curriculum 
Framework adopted by the State B
oard of Education. In addition, the Board by resolution determined that every pupil, 
including English learners, has sufficient textbooks or instructional materials consistent with the content and cycles of the

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
On March 21, 2008, the main school structure was closed for the remainder of the 2007
-
08 school year and the students 
moved to temporary classrooms. For the 2008
-
09 and 2009
-
10 school years, Diamond View was housed
 
on the Meadow 
View Campus located on Paiute Lane in Susanville. Meadow View School opened in the fall of 1992, making it the newest 
school in the District. The Susanville School District, with support from the Susanville Community passed a bond Measure 
on
 
the November 2008 ballot, and plans were made to begin modernizing the Diamond View campus in January of 2009. 
On August 30, 2010 Diamond View School reopened after a complete renovation of our classroom and hallway facilities. 
There is one permanent buil
ding containing 15 classrooms, a library, office complex, and multipurpose room/cafeteria. In 
addition, there are 3 modular units which house two computer labs and additional classroom space. The playground is 
very large, encompassing approximately six acr
es. A portion of this area is blacktop playground, with the remainder 
devoted to grass playing fields and playground equipment areas. Both the library and computer lab are advanced and 
state of the art by middle school standards. The computer lab has 34 ne
w computer workstations, all of which have high
-
speed Internet connections. A second computer lab with 37 workstations was added for expanded technology experiences 
for our students and to accommodate the additional needs required for state mandated testin
g. As a community asset, 

 
 
The school and community use the facility extensively for both athletic and social functions. We also have a functioning 
multipurpose facilit
y that is used throughout the year for student and community activities. Diamond View has become 
the host school for large inter
-
scholastic events in Lassen County such as Lit Jam and the County wide Spelling Bee.
 
 
The District employs one full
-
time lead m
aintenance and grounds staff member, and one part
-
time grounds/maintenance 
employee. District maintenance staff utilize the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by OPSC to survey facility needs 
on a regular basis. The most recent inspection was done in
 

-
time custodian at each school site. One full
-
time custodian is assigned to the school during the entire school day. One 
part
-
time custodian is assigned in the evenings. The day custodian as
sures that restrooms are clean and stocked 
throughout the day, in addition to providing custodial services to classrooms, cafeteria and the kitchen. All custodians 
follow daily cleaning schedules that are established by the site administrator. The daily cl
eaning schedules reflect the 
cleaning standards identified by the California Association of School Business Officials (CASBO) Custodial handbook.
 
 
Through the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), the District prioritizes facility and maintenance needs
 
for the school 
each year and provides budgetary resources to keep Diamond View in top condition for student learning.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
