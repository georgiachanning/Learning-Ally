By February 1 of each year, e
very school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC)
. The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of 
each California public
 school. 
Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies 
(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 

meet annual school
-specific goals for all pupils, with spec
ific activities to address state and local priorities. 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC. 
   For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) 
SARC Web page
 at 
http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.    For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF Web page at
 http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.    For addition
al information about the school, parents
/guardians
 and community members should contact 
the school principal or the district office.
  DataQuest
 DataQuest
 is an online data tool located on the CDE 
DataQuest
 Web page at 
http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the county, 
and the state. Specifically, 
DataQuest
 is a dynamic system that provides re
ports for accountability 
(e.g., 
test 
data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners.
  Internet Access
 Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the 
California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-come, first
-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a 
workstation may be used (dep
ending on availability), the types of software programs available on a 

workstation, and the ability to print documents.

 The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
  Statewide ass

 (i.e
., California Assessment of Student Performance and 
Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which
 includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 

Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for Englis
h language arts/literacy [ELA] and 
mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible 

students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned 

with alternate achievement standards, which are linked wit
h the Common Core State 
Standards [CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and 
  The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the 

requirements for entrance to the University of California and 
the California State 
University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study.

   Opportunities for Parental Involvement 
Œ (School Year 2019
-20) Parents are a vital component of our school community.  They are involved on our 
Parent Advisory 
Committee, and volunteer in the classrooms on a regular basis.  Since we do not have bussing, we rely 
heavily on parents for transportation to and from field tri
ps.  
Parents are kept abreast of all school activities 
through newsletters, emails, and texts. We also use Blackboard Connect to keep parents informed of school 
activities.  We conduct a parent survey
 though our CA Healthy Kids Survey in the fall and a dis
trict
-level parent 
survey in the spring
.  Parent workshops are held throughout the year to teach parents about technology and 
curriculum.  We hold a Back to School Night at the beginning of the year.  
We are focusing on college and 
career readiness goals a
nd welcome parents to education
-based informational meetings.

evaluate our school™s 
safety plan.  
Our safety plan was totally
 revised in February of 2015 with minor
 revisions
 in subsequent years
.  We practice monthly fire drills,
 lockdown
 procedures, and earthquake drills.
  Lockdown procedures have also 
been evaluated by the Lassen County Sheriff™s Dept.
  In o
