School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to 
publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to pre
pare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consis
tent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and communi
ty members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dat
aquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Continuing with the Petaluma City School district's commitment to provide innovative and rigorous learning opportunities, 
The Sixth Grade Academy Charter School, established in 2011, focuses on integrated curriculum, elective offerings and 
technology
-
assisted learning. Two highly skilled and credentialed teachers work in concert to provide meaningful 
connections between the disciplines and curriculum with an emphasis on higher
-
order thinking skills. Students participate 
in an A and B block s
chedule of extended time, allowing for greater focus and depth of study. Each teacher is responsible 
for the thematic integration of either math and science or English and social studies. The two teachers prepare lessons 
together to insure high interest, s
tudent participation and challenge. In addition to the integrated core curriculum and a 
physical education class, students participate in an elective program.  They are also able to participate with the PJHS band 
courses.
 
 
The school is housed on the PJHS 
campus in two adjoining classrooms, E
-
2 and E
-
3, located next to the main office. Both 
classrooms are fully
-
 
equipped science rooms, with wi
-
fi connectivity, flat screen TVs, and individual ipads.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Stud
ent Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematic
s given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career tec
hnical education sequences or programs 
of study.

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the CA

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number 
of students who met the standard 
(i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on
 
the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

The 6th Grade Academy at Petaluma Junior High School Safety Plan is incorporated in the Petaluma Junior High School 
plan and is annually reviewed and practiced each year as part of an on going effort to update our procedures and introduce 
n
ew staff to the protocol. In collaboration with a district level safety grant, fire, earthquake, and lockdown drills involvin
g 
the entire staff and student body are conducted monthly. The Principal Advisory Committee reviews the plan with input 
from the tw
o 6th Grade Academy teachers and provides opportunities for parent review and input. District and local 
emergency agencies are invited to attend each drill, monitor, and provide feedback on the effectiveness of the drills.  The 
principal also meets with la
w enforcement to review needs for the campus.
