our vision and goals, and the wonderful collaboration in place among staff, students, parents, and 
community membe
rs that make Hidden Hills an exceptional learning environment. Established in 
August 2004, we are  known for our high standards for student achievement and for our success in 
helping children become well
-
rounded and productive citizens. Hidden Hills takes 
pride in our 
reputation of excellence, providing a positive, caring, and nurturing environment where students 
and staff are encouraged to do their best. Our highly

and work collaboratively with parents and com
munity volunteers to ensure that every child's needs 
are being met. This collaboration among teachers, support staff, parents, and community is the

School Profile
 
Hidden Hills Elementary School opened in August 2004, the second 
developer
-
built school in the Dougherty Valley of San Ramon. It is 
located in a rapidly growing residential community of primarily single family dwellings. Our students are ethnically diverse.
 
Our parents 
place a high value on education and support our sch

support, volunteer time, committee leadership, and professional services. While most families are from upper middle class inc
omes, with 
two working, well
-
educated parents in
 
the household, we do receive targeted Title One funds to support students in need.  Approximately 
7% of our students come from low income families as determined by the free and reduced lunch count.  Twenty
-
four full time and one 
part time teacher, one ful
l time administrator, a part
-
time teacher on special assignment, four instructional assistants, and four classroom 
paraeducators, provide our educational program in self
-
contained classrooms for just over 650 transitional kindergarten through fifth 
grade s
tudents. Our school offers an academic program for all levels of student abilities.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate ac
hievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

At Hidden Hills Elementary, we are fortunate to have strong community support through the Parent Teachers Association (PTA), 
the Hidden Hills Hawks 
Education Fund (fundraising), corporate sponsors, and a substantial amount of active parent involvement in our classrooms.  P
TA supports our school by 
providing parent education events, legislative information, and providing volunteers for community
-
buildi
ng events such as the Back to School Block 
Party, Family Science Night, movie nights, the talent show, and registration. Book fairs provide additional funds for library
 
books, assemblies, and special 
events. The Hawks Education Fund handles the bulk of our
 
fundraising for the school. The fall registration donation campaign, a walk
-
a

thon, a fall 
carnival, an auction, and corporate matching raise substantial amounts of money to fund additional programs and services for 
students. Students at 
Hidden Hills rece

School Safety Plan
 
Hidden Hills Elementary is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain the conditions which contribute 
to the best poss
ible learning 
environment and ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school safety committee has created a comprehensive D
isaster Preparedness 
Plan. This plan is updated annually, and input is gathered from staff and our School Site Counci
l.  Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated 
for effectiveness. These drills include procedures for fire, earthquake, intruder on campus, and shelter in place. The PTA he
lps us inventory our classroom 
first aid kits and emergency backpacks. The
 
school maintains a trailer containing emergency supplies for the entire school. Hidden Hills provides compiled 
school crime information each month for the California Safe School Assessment as mandated by the State of California. All sch
ool employees are r
equired 
by law to report any cases of suspected child abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Child and
 
Family Services to determine 
if any follow
-
up on the report is necessary. Hidden Hills strictly adheres to district polici
es which prohibit harassment or discrimination of any kind. Hidden 
Hills believes that a safe and orderly environment is necessary to ensure a positive learning experience for all students. On
going supervision is the core 
of creating and maintaining a safe
 
and orderly environment. Staff continually supervises and interacts with students to reinforce behavioral expectations 
and safety standards.

The San Ramon Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development 
for all staff. Our high 
quality professional development program is 
focused on California State Standards as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies. We hold 
affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math Initiati
ve. Both organizations are
 
highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the state standards and professional learning 
offerings.  These learning 
experiences are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work an
d train together. They provide one
-
to
-
one 
coaching, team and grade level coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional 
development sessions. These trainings connect to every aspect
 
of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, 
formative assessment for learning, and lesson design.  Teachers also work together to determine essential standards at each g
rade level, and analyze 
assessment data
 
to provide the most effective interventions.

We ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project. Our summer intensive trainings
, along with on
-
going 
staff development days and release day trainings, align with t
he needs of our individual schools and our Framework for Excellence: Supporting Students 
and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.
 
 
Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practice afford our staff the oppor
tunity to deepen their content 
knowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of respo
nsibility. As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in w
hich the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.
