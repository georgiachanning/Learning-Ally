School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Valley Center Elementary School we believe in putting students first and that kindness matters for all.  With this 
philosophy, we strive to maintain a student
-
centered culture by developing conne
ctions with our students, families, and 
community partners.  We serve just over 500 students in grades third through fifth and offer both English Only and Dual 
Language classes.  We offer Special Education classes ranging from mild
-
moderate to moderate
-
sev
ere.  Community within 
our school walls and beyond is the heart of our school.  The strength of our community and wholehearted passion to make 
our school a wonderful place for learning makes Valley Center Elementary School truly a special place.  It is our
 
goal to 
ensure our students are meeting academic standards, are engaged in learning, and developing the social emotional skills 
that will help them to become successful adults.
 
 
Community of Kindness is a hallmark of our campus. Student ambassadors work t
ogether to create monthly schoolwide 
character education lessons for our students. These lessons focus on empathy, being an upstander, anti
-
bullying 
messages, and more.  Our schoolwide Kindness club meets during lunch to plan activities to spread kindness 
around 


teache
s students to Never give up, Encourage others, and to Do their best.
 
 
We have a number of community partnerships to support our school and students.  Our local high schools sends leadership 
students to our school to model for our students inclusion and goo
d sportsmanship.  For the past two years, our school 
has partnered with our community to create a thriving volunteer reading program.  The program kicks off every September 
and provides reading buddies to students who need additional support to reach grade
-
level reading standards.  This 
program offers the community an opportunity to give back to our students and the students love reading with their 
assigned buddy.  In addition to our reading volunteers, our staff works closely with our American Indian Educa
tion Centers 
to develop programs that support the individual learning needs of our students.  This reciprocal relationship supports our 
students and helps to build cultural awareness and understanding for our staff.  Parental involvement is key to our 
stud
ents' success and volunteers are welcome on campus. Our staff works diligently to communicate and partner with 
our parents with continual progress updates and suggestions on how they can support their child at home.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are welcome on

process to ensure the safety of all our students. Parents help around school in a variety of ways. They help with projects, 
read with students, volunteer in our
 
FAVE art program, chaperone on field  trips, help run school events, and more. We 
encourage parents to attend School Site Council and ELAC advisory groups, as well as join our Teacher Parent Club(TPC).  
Annually we offer a parent survey to collect parent 
input about our school and programs.  Parent input is desired and 
welcome.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our safety plan was revised and updated November 2018 and approved by our School Site Council. We are in the process 
of updating and submitting the safety plan for the 19
-
20 school year, to be approved by December of 2019.  Our site safety 
plan indicates t
he roles staff will take in the event of an emergency (Incident Command). It details our evacuation routes, 
student gathering areas, and resources. Various scenarios are reviewed by emergency type. Our staff had the opportunity 
to be trained by a San Diego
 
County Sheriff deputy on Armed Intruder responses in December of 2018 and we continue 
to train our staff with the Options
-
Based method during the 19
-
20 school year.  The staff runs regular drills to ensure we 
improve our process and always learn how to be
 
more efficient with each exercise.
