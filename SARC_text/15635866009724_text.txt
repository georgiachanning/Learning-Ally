School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with 
data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members
 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates,
 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Conferences, board meetings, community meetings, LCAP meetings, award and honor roll assemblies, spooktacular day,

may work in the classroom with the teacher, outside of the classroom making copies, correcting, planning activities such 
as fundraisers, spooktacular day, field trips, movie nights, winter
 
program, Dr. Seuss Day, and Kindergarten/8th grade

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Linns Valley
-
Poso Flat School. The school is in compliance with laws, 
rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. T
he School Site Safety plan was 
last reviewed and updated in January 2019 by the School Principal. All revisions are communicated to both the classified 

staff safety during 
a disaster.  A copy of this plan will be kept in the office as well as the staff lounge.
 
 
Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. There is a designated area for student 
drop off and pick up.
 
Visitors must check in at the office and sign in the visitor log book before proceeding into the main 
campus and entering the classrooms. Teachers are trained in procedures for the event of an intruder. Teachers and 
support staff are required to wear thei
r school ID badges and carry cell phones.  The badge enables teachers to be quickly 
identified by the first responders and the cell phones provide immediate contact with other staff and emergency officials 
in time of need.
