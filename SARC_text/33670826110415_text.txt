B
autista Creek is a Transitional 
Kindergarten through Grade 5 public elementary school, including 
a Transitional Kindergarten through Grade 5 Autism program and two preschool classes, enjoying 
its 27th year of providing high
-
quality education to young people.  This year, Bautista Creek 
El
ementary has the privilege of serving approximately 990 students.  Our goal is to provide a safe 
and caring learning environment where all children are able to succeed to their highest academic, 
social and emotional potential. Bautista Creek Elementary enc
ourages creativity, innovative 
thinking, cooperative problem solving and a strong commitment to academic excellence.  The 
unique potential and self
-
esteem of individual students are valued and nurtured.  This 
comprehensive approach to education prepares ou
r students for success throughout their 
academic careers as well as preparing them to become productive and active citizens within our 
community.
 
 
Students Achieving in Fun Environments (SAFE), an after
-
school program serves approximately 125 
of our student
s.  The SAFE program provides students in Kindergarten through fifth grade extended 
learning opportunities and positive behavior support from school dismissal until 6:00 P.M.  SAFE 
provides access to homework assistance, extended learning opportunities in 
math and language 
arts, and a standards
-
based physical education program.
 
 
At Bautista Creek Elementary, we have implemented Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports 
(PBIS). The school focuses on building school culture and climate that considers all st
akeholders 
members of the Bautista Creek Family.  A safe school environment that fosters a climate of honesty 
and respect is the base for our Positive Behavior Support Plan.  The standards for behavior are clear 
to faculty, students and parents.  All membe
rs of the Bautista Creek community reinforce these 
behavior expectations.  We expect that positive behavior is modeled, reinforced, and practiced by 
all members of our site.
 
 
The Student Ambassadors of Bautista Creek coordinates a variety of family events a
nd activities 
throughout the school year.  In addition, Bautista Creek has forged a strong relationship with local 
businesses as well who support our efforts in fundraising and student incentive awards. Finally, 
Bautista Creek Elementary has received the h
onor of being recognized for its many 
accomplishments in serving our students.  Not only is Bautista Creek a California Distinguished 
School, but, Bautista Creek received the PBIS Silver Award for the past three years, the Title I 
Achieving School Award tw
ice in recent years, as well as the California Business for Education 
Excellence Honor Roll School Award in 2009 and 2014.
 
The current goals for Bautista Creek are providing high
-
quality teaching and learning for all 
students; developing a system of 
support for academic, behavior, and social
-
emotional success for 
all students; and engage stakeholders to create a culture and climate to support all students.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal
 
or the 
district office.

Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

A District committee considers textbooks for recommendation on a cycle established by the State Board of Education and from a
 
State adopted list.  The 
committee meets to discuss cu
rrent issues relevant to the subject matter, including student success, previously used textbooks, and instructional 
methods.  The committee reviews demonstration copies of proposed textbooks, as well as listen to representatives describe the
 
various highl
ights of the 
available materials.  The review is followed by a pilot of materials that results in consensus by the committee of a recommen
ded textbook.  The textbook 
is forwarded to a K
-
12 Curriculum Council, which consists of teachers, parents, and commun
ity stakeholders, for review and approval.  If the textbook is 
approved by the K
-
12 Curriculum Council, the textbook is forwarded to the Superintendent and the Governing Board for their review and approval.
  
Each 
pupil in the district, including English le
arners, kindergarten through grade twelve, is provided with standards
-
aligned textbooks or basic instructional 
materials that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the State Board.
 
 
AB 1246, added Education Code 
Section 60210, which allows the district to use any instructional materials, not just state
-
adopted, as long as they are 
aligned with the academic content standards.  The EC 60119 has a new section (e) with a reference to the Common Core State St
andards (C
CSS).  The 

content standards, it is the 
intent of the Legislature that textbooks, instructional materials, and supplemental instruc
tional materials be deemed to be aligned with the content 
standards pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (c), and be deemed consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framew
ork adopted by the state 
board pursuant to subdivision (a) if the textboo
ks, instructional materials, supplemental instructional materials, or a combination of any such materials 

ed to either the 1997 
sta
ndards or the 2010 CCSS standards for mathematics and English Language Arts are compliant with Williams Act requirements.  In
 
accordance with 
Education Code Section 60422(a) and 60119, the Governing Board certified on 9/3/2019 that each pupil in the distri
ct, including English learners, in 
kindergarten through grade twelve, has been provided with standards
-

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
