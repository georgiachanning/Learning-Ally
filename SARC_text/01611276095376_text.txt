Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvem
ents (Most Recent Year)
 
 
A Facilities Master Plan was approved in 2014. Plans are in progress to utilize Bond Measures B & E approved by Albany 
voters in June 2016. In general, our district needs to prepare for anticipated growth in enrollment and
 
the addition and/or 
replacement of existing facilities. Over the coming year, we will determine when to schedule the Marin Elementary School 
Project and how to address temporarily housing students off campus.
 
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary
 
concern at Marin Elementary School. The school site safety plan is updated 
annually. The key element of the school site safety plan encompasses student safety and evacuation procedures. Fire, 
earthquake and lockdown drills are conducted on a regular basis
. To ensure student safety, staff members supervise 
students at all times before and after school, during recess and lunch. Any visitors to the campus are required to check in 

 
 
The school was built in 1975. There are challenges prov
iding sufficient classroom, playground and staff spaces to support 
teaching and learning due to increased enrollment, but we are keeping up to meet the needs of 24 classrooms, a 
multipurpose room, a library and several play areas. District maintenance staf
f ensures that work orders and the repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair are completed in a timely manner. A work
-
order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and the highest priority to emergency repairs.
 
 
There are two custodians. One 
works from early morning to afternoon and the other works from afternoon to late night 
Monday through Friday. The principal works with custodial staff members to ensure the cleaning of the school is 
maintained to provide a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
