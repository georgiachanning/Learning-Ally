By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State pr
iority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and t
he 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requiremen
ts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Palo Verde Unified School District and 
Margaret White Elementary believe in early identification and intervention of 
underperforming students prior to testing for learning disabilities, ensuring every student receives the instruction and 
skills necessary to proficiently progress from one grade 
to the next. All students are mainstreamed in a general education 
classroom and receive instruction based on their learning level, Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) or Student Study 
Team guidelines. Instructional programs are aligned with state and dis
trict standards, and teachers use a variety of 
instructional techniques and supplemental instructional materials and programs to deliver classroom lessons.
 
 

teachers and seven 
instructional aides. Students are served in the special education rooms or in their classrooms. For students who are 
mainstreamed, special education staff works closely with classroom teachers to provide instruction either on regularly 
a

Individualized instruction for special education students is 1. based on their IEP and 2. provided in the least restrictive 



 
 
Palo Verde Unified School District is a member of the multidistrict Riverside County Special Education Local Plan Area 
(SELPA), which collaborates with 21 school
 
districts and other public and private agencies to provide a full complement of 
special education services for Margaret White Elementary students. Through the SELPA, students have access to a pool of 
resources and expertise in the field of special educati
on.
 
 
English learners (EL) are identified through the English Language Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC) and home 
language survey. Students are placed in a classroom with a teacher who has been trained to teach second
-
language skills 
to element
ary students.
 
 
During language arts instruction, Level 1 English learners (students at the very early stages of learning the English languag
e) 
are teamed up with qualified teachers for English language development (ELD) instruction, which focuses on increa
sing 
vocabulary skills and language fluency.
 
 
Margaret White Elementary uses the Carousel of IDEAS, the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit by Kate Kinsella, the English in 
a Flash curriculum and the Houghton Mifflin series for ELD and reading intervention instruc
tion. English learners are 
assessed annually to measure English
-
language acquisition and adjust reading level and ELD needs accordingly.

For staff, 
the following results have been observed:
 

 
Reduction of isolation of teachers
 

 
Increased commitment to the mission and goals of the school and increased vigor in working to strengthen the 
mission
 

 
Shared responsibility for the total development of the student
s and collective responsibility for student success
 

 
Powerful learning that defines good teaching and classroom practices and that creates new knowledge and beliefs 
about teaching and learners
 

 
Increased meaning and understanding of the content that teachers
 
teach and the roles they play in helping all 
students achieve expectations
 

 
Higher likelihood that teachers will be well
-
informed, professionally renewed and inspired to inspire students
 

 
More satisfaction, higher morale and lower rates of absenteeism
 

 
Signi
ficant advances in adapting teaching to the students accomplished more quickly than in traditional schools
 

 
Commitment to making significant and lasting changes and a higher likelihood of undertaking fundamental 
systemic change
 
 
For students, the 
results include:
 

 
Increased positive relationships with staff
 

 

 

 
Increased academic gains in math, science, history and reading than in traditional schools
 

 
Smaller achievement g
aps between students from different backgrounds
 
 
As part of the growth process, supplemental training and staff development activities were provided at Margaret White 
Elementary based on teacher input, student assessment data, feedback from professional co
nferences and Program 
Improvement goals. During the 2016
-
17 school year, our professional development efforts focused on using student data 
to design effective classroom instruction, checking for understanding, the development of appropriate classroom 
asse
ssments (benchmarks, common assessments and formative assessments) and the development of standards
-
based 
pacing guides in English language arts and mathematics. During the 2017/2018 school year our professional development 
has focused on Direct Interactiv
e Instruction. While we continue to make steady improvements in all areas, we recognize 
there is still room for improvement in specific content areas and student group populations. During the 2018/2019 school 
year our professional development continues to 
focus on Direct Interactive Instruction. However, it was shared that 
teachers wanted more support in the curriculum. Therefore in the 2019/2020 school year, there was an emphasis in 
providing support in curriculum.
