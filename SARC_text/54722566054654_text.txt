By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mountain View Elementary School takes great efforts to ensure a safe, clean, and functional physical environment for 
students, staff, and 
volunteers. Sufficient space is provided for students and staff to support teaching and learning. This 
includes space provided by classrooms, playgrounds, and staff work rooms. To assist our school in this effort, the district 
uses a facility survey instru
ment developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are available at the district office. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may b
e 
obtained by speaking with the scho
ol principal.

Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that 
emergency repairs are 
given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
In addition to custodial staff on duty during the school day, a team of maintenance specialists come in after hours for daily
 
cleaning. District and school maintenance staff w
ork cooperatively with administrators to develop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.  Summer deep
-
cleaning and further maintenance is also performed on site.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Program
 
The district participates in the State School Defe
rred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a 
dollar for dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school build
ing 
components.  Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, hea
ting, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior 
painting, and floor systems. The deferred maintenance program ensures that all classrooms and facilities are maintained 
to a degree of adequacy that allows for a good learning environment.  D
uring the 2015
-
16 school year, routine 
maintenance was also completed.
 
 
Facilities Improvements
 
During the summer following the conclusion of the 2013
-
14 school year, the entire school site (all buildings) was painted.  
The old, steel playground structure 
was removed and replaced with two brand new play structures which added to student 
safety and physical activity. A single  point of access system was installed prior to the start of the 2015
-
2016 school year.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

is calculated by taking the total number of 
students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who 
met the standard (i.e., achieved 
Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total nu
mber of students who participated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect stud
ent privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages
. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Parent involvement and 
communication are essential to our school success. Mountain View Elementary School continually 
strives to involve parents by sharing information that helps parents understand and support school programs and by 
providing opportunities for parent participati
on in school activities. Spanish translation is provided for parents who have 
that need.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement, including but not limited to: attending school 
functions such as Back to School Night, Open House,
 
Literacy Night, Mountain View Carnival; monthly assemblies and 
special events, such as the September 911 celebration, and class programs.  Parents may also participate in parent
-
teacher 
conferences; volunteering in classrooms; and chaperoning field trips.
 
Parents may also serve on advisory committees and 
leadership teams, including, but not limited to, the English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC) and School Site Council 
(SSC).  Additional opportunities for parental involvement also exist at the district 
level.   Parents have the opportunity to 
participate in the parent education program with our SAFE coordinator during the  school year.  Parents may also get 
involved in the Mountain View PTO to help support activities and programs for students.

The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is designed to assist in maintaining a safe school environment and preparing for 
emergencies.  The plan requires identification of security needs, developmen
t of prevention and intervention techniques, 
evaluation of physical facilities, and communication with staff and students.  It also illustrates maps depicting evacuation 
areas and locations of electrical, water, and gas mains.  The school safety plan is up
dated and revised as needed  
throughout the year and reviewed annually in August with staff.  The plan is reviewed/revised, input is sought and 
approved by the School Site Council each October, and then it is shared with staff again. The plan is approved b
y the school 
board shortly after approval by the school's School Site Council.  The School Safety Plan is fully compliant with federal and
 
state regulations.  An updated copy is available to the public at the school office.
 
 

ess plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  Emergency 
preparedness drills are conducted monthly and the school staff is appropriately trained.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The following areas of professional development have been provided to staff:  professional learning communities, PBIS, 
effective math and literacy instruction and other 
areas as indicated by school data.  Our district provides professional 
development based on data from both the district and school level to ensure that areas of need are being addressed.  
Professional Development occurs at the district, school and classroo
m level dependent on teacher goals.  The district 
provides Teachers on Special Assignment at all grade levels to provide on
-
site coaching and support after professional 
development has occurred.
 
 
Support for Novice Teachers:  Due to a shortage of highly qu


challenge and in compliance with the California Commission on Teacher Cre
dentialing, Visalia Unified offers a robust 
support and training system for these novice educators including differentiated professional development and continuous 
professional growth opportunities.  The professional learning system begins with the New Cer
tificated Staff Summer 
Institute which is a five
-
day interactive training offered in August one week before school begins.  This training covers 
classroom management, classroom culture, curriculum frameworks, and lesson design. In addition, a four
-
day work
shop 
on student engagement and cooperative learning is offered during winter break so that teachers may implement new 
structures and strategies during the spring semester.  All novice teachers receive ongoing support and individualized 
training throughout 
the year via weekly meetings with their assigned mentor at their respective school sites.  Mentors 
and district teachers
-
on
-
assignment support implementation of new knowledge by providing in
-
class coaching, 
collaborating on lesson design, accompanying novi
ce teachers on classroom tours, and assisting with student data analysis 
to drive instructional decisions.  In addition, novice teachers and their mentors attend monthly after school training in 
action research and are provided time to reflect on their ins
tructional practice.   Mentors and teachers on assignment are 
carefully selected experienced educators trained in how to facilitate the individualized professional growth of novice 
teachers.  Novice teachers who have preliminary credentials participate in 
the VUSD Teacher Induction Clear Credential 
Program which is accredited by the Commission and is offered at no cost to the candidate.
 
 
Support for Veteran Teachers:  Veteran teachers in need of classroom management assistance also have access to one
-
on
-
one
 
mentor support as may be needed in the case of a new grade level assignment or challenging class.  Visalia Unified 
also offers a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program which is a formal system of mentoring and accountability.
