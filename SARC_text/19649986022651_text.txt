School Description
 
Cedarcreek
 
Elementary School is a dedicated compassionate community that respects every 
scholars ability to learn, persevere, and succeed.
 
 
Cedarcreek is a California Gold Ribbon School that provides all learners with a well rounded 
elementary school education focus
ed on a rigorous student centered academic program.  An 
emphasis on developing academic language across disciplines prepares our students for bold 
explorations of 21st century learning challenges.  Students participate in a hands on Culinary Arts 
program d
esigned to teach integrated math and science skill as well as healthy living choices.  

-
Critical Thinking, Communication, Collaboration 
and Creativity are evident in all classrooms through arts integration 
and project based learning.
 
 
A California Silver Award winning school, Cedarcreek implements the PBIS, Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support system of teaching behavior expectations.  We teach students consistent 
school wide behavior expectations and 
acknowledge it in our R.O.A.R. motto; that is Respect, Own 
your actions, Act safely, and be Responsible.
 
 
Cedarcreek Elementary School offers a variety of after

opportunities for our students.  Students who are at

instruction that will allow them to meet grade
-
level proficiencies.  We have a variety of enrichment 
classes, such as music, art, robotics and cooking classes, available to all students throughout the 
school year.

Our goal is to provide an educational experience that inspires each individual student to love 
learning, embrace challenges, build char

to be kind and caring citizens.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains 
information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes h
ow they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

l.  Our 

t days are focused on enhancing 
our instructional delivery for students at all ability levels, including strategies that best meet the needs of our English L
anguage Learners and at
-
risk 
students.
 
 
Cedarcreek staff members have been trained in Systematic En
glish Language Development; new teachers will be trained by the end of the school year.  
In order to meet the needs of English learners during core curriculum a select group of teachers were trained in Constructing
 
Meaning, which helps 
support integrated l
anguage development.  Training is continuing with additional teachers participating in training each school year.  This train
ing assists 
our staff members at better meeting the linguistic and academic needs of all of our students.
 
 
Technology in the classr
ooms has also been a focus this school year.  All classrooms, kindergarten through sixth grade, have access to Chromebooks or
 
laptops in order for them to learn typing skills, use Google classroom, complete research, and engage in individual lessons o
n the
 
I
-
Ready program. 
Students enrich their mathematical skills in problem solving using on
-
line NextGen Math.  Every classroom also has the newest flat panel technology in 
order to deliver the most interactive, engaging lessons possible. Professional growth t
raining is provided in the use of these technologies throughout the 
school year.
 
 
In addition, the district provides Teachers on Special Assignment, TOSA, who support our teachers.  Our TOSA Staff includes a
 
Physical Education teacher, 
technology teachers,
 
early Literacy teachers, math teachers, and a science teacher.   The TOSAs provide staff development, demonstration lessons, 
and 
individual training for teachers throughout the district.
