About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For 
more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF 
web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the State of California Office of Public Sch
ool Construction. The results of this survey are available at the KCUSD Business Office.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided w
ith a clean, safe, and 
functional learnin
g environment. Additional information about the condition of the school's facilities may be obtained by speaking with the sch
ool 
principal.
 
 
Dunlap Elementary School has 24 classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and an administration building. The main
 
campus was built in 1950. 
Additional classrooms were constructed in 1977, 1979, 1984, and additional relocatable classrooms were constructed in1985 and
 
1996. Construction of 
a new multipurpose room / gymnasium / cafeteria was completed in August of 2010. 
 
Renovations were made to current facilities for the creation of a 
new school library and computer lab and completed in May of 2014.  Safe Passage improvements were made to Dunlap School with 
the completion of a 
new crosswalk in the front of the school in 
November of 2017.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are g
iven the highest priority.
 
 
The Director of Maintenance, Custodial Supervisor, and the site principals work cooperatively with the custodial staff to dev
elop cleaning schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
The district participates in the
 
State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides state matching funds on a dollar for dollar basis to assist 
school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this in
cludes roofi
ng, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.
 
 
Over the summer of 2013 building doors and trim were repainted giving the school a clean appearance. In the spring of 2012 al
l lighting systems 
were 
inspected and upgraded along with air conditioning thermostats to maximize energy conservation.  During the summer of 2014 tw
o classrooms were 
completely renovated adding new carpet, paint and technologies related to instruction were added.  Blacktop 
areas were replaced in the summer of 
2016.  In the summer of 2017, the primary building and intermediate quad building were completely renovated.  In 2019 new art
ificial turf was installed 
in the intermediate quad area and in front of the primary building.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement and communication are essential to our school success. Dunlap Elementary School continually strives to inv
olve parents by 
exchanging information that helps parents understand and support school programs and 
by providing opportunities for parent participation in school 
activities.
 
 
There are numerous and varied opportunities for parent involvement. Parents attend school functions and parent visitation day
s, participate in parent
-
teacher conferences, volunteer 
in classrooms, chaperone field trips, and assist with book fairs and fundraisers. Parents also serve on advisory committees 
and leadership teams, including the Parent Teacher Club (PTC), School Site Council (SSC), District Advisory Committee (DAC), 
English
 
Learner Advisory 
Council (ELAC), and District English Learner Advisory Council (DELAC).
 
 
Home and school communication is enhanced through the monthly Bobcat Brief, monthly Parent Teacher Club newsletters, parent/t
eacher conferences, 
the student/parent ha
ndbook, the school website, the school messenger telephone messaging system, student report cards, and other regular 
communication activities.

State Priority: 
School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Dunlap Elementary School. Before, during, and after school, the campus i
s monitored by assigned 
staff. All visitors must sign in at the office and wear appropriate identification while on campus.
 
 
The co
mprehensive school safety plan is designed to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and m
aintaining a safe 
school environment. The plan requires identification of security needs, development of prevention and interventio
n techniques, evaluation of physical 
facilities, and communication with staff and students. Components of the plan include: child abuse reporting procedures, proc
edures for teacher 
notification of dangerous pupils, disaster response procedures, procedures 
for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policies, and 
suspension and expulsion policies. The safety plan is reviewed annually, updated as needed, and fully compliant with federal 
and state regulations. The 
plan was last reviewed/updated 
in February 2019 and discussed with the Dunlap School Site Council in February 2019 and then shared with the Dunlap 
staff in August of 2019. An updated copy is available to the public at the school office.
 
 
The school's disaster preparedness plan includes 
steps for ensuring the safety of students and staff during a disaster. Emergency preparedness drills are 
conducted regularly and the school staff is appropriately trained.

Professional development at Dunlap Elementary School is designed to meet the individual needs of teachers as well as broader 
school concerns. 
Professional development may take the form of trainings, coaching, peer 
observation, or constructive self
-
reflection and is consistent with our school 
vision and goals. Principal, teachers, instructional aides, and other support personnel may take part in these activities.
 
 
In the 2016
-
19 school years Dunlap School focused on 
implementing the newly adopted Engage NY curriculums in both ELA and math.  Training was 
provided to support teacher implementation and understanding of how they should best utilize these curricular resources.  The
re was also a focus on 
the integration and
 
emphasis of targeted vocabulary through the use of response frames and front loading activities.  These practices were adopte
d to 
support all student learning, especially English Language Learners.  Regular grade level PLC meetings serve as a platform for
 
grade level specific trainings 
and the sharing of best practices.  Site based PLC meetings are held every other Wednesday to provide grade level support of 
direct instruction strategies, 
data collection and ongoing common core training and support.  Teach
ers are allowed release time to plan for instruction/intervention and to observe 
other teacher's lessons at other school sites.
 
 
In the 2017
-
18 and 2018
-
19 school years Dunlap School contracted with the English Learner Group who provided training on the EL
D Framework and 
Standards.  Teachers were taught how to understand the ELD standards and how it fits with the framework in developing designa
ted and integrated 
approaches to instruction in each content area.
 
 
School administration performs walkthrough obse
rvations daily in each classroom. Monthly goals are established to improve instructional delivery and 
benefit student achievement. Administration provides real
-
time coaching during walkthroughs and always provides feedback to teachers.
