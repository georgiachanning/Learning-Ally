Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Napa Junction School, originally built in 1953, currently houses 16 classrooms, a computer lab, a library, an intervention 
classroom, and a 
multi
-
purpose room.  All interior spaces were modernized during the summer of 2001.  Several rooms 
got earthquake repairs during the 2014
-
2015 school year, as well.  Enhancements included electrical and internet wiring, 
plumbing, interior paint, flooring, 
and tack walls.  Heating and air
-
conditioning units were previously installed.  Each 
classroom is equipped with technology that supports student learning.  All playground structures were replaced through 
the combined efforts of community, school district, 
staff, and parents between 1998 and March 2002.  We have a district
-
run preschool program of two classes on our campus.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Description: A schoolwide focus on safety, health and well being has resulted in a campus that is virtually free of violence,
 
drugs and crime.  
Inspections by the Napa Fire Department address code compliance and assure that facilities are safe for 
students and staff.  Our Standard Emergency Management System (SEMS) includes biannual Crime Reports, Student 
Discipline, Sexual Harassment, Dealing wit
h Dangerous Pupils, Crises Response Plan, Dress Code and Alternative Programs.  
The SEMS is reviewed annually.  Emergency equipment has been supplied for each classroom and for the school as a 
whole.  Fire drills are held monthly.  Earthquake drills, Teach
er Down drills and Active Shooter drills occur several times 
during the school year.  During the first weeks of school, teachers and the principal explain policies about student safety, 
playground, rules, classroom behavior, bullying and harassment.

Students are released from school at 1:15 each Wednesday.  This allows for a variety of professional development 
opportunities for the teachers.  In addition, grade level teams are released 
from the classroom to collaborate as they 
develop units of study and assess student progress.  The primary focus of professional development this year will be 
around learning targets, both short and long term and using student data to inform instruction.
