By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability
 
Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
F
or more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or
 
LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
pr
incipal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Willia
ms vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementa
ry materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation
 
is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in August, 201
9 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Our facilities are neat, clean, and in good working order. Facility inspections occur weekly to identify any areas of 
immediate concern for repair. Annually we h
ave a thorough facility inspection by a team composed of site and district 
personnel to identify future areas to address and prioritize facility needs. The site custodian also attends monthly facility
 
meetings with other custodians in the district. The hea
d custodian then communicates information to the principal 
regarding standards of performance, expectations, practices, etc. Teachers routinely complete check lists evaluating 
cleanliness of their classrooms. Staff complete overall facility satisfaction su
rveys annually. Playground inspections are 
done on a routine basis. All inspections, surveys, checklists, etc. have been positive. The condition of the facility remains
 
a source of pride and satisfaction for students, staff, and families.  Our most recent 
District Facility Site Inspection was on 
November 13th, 2019.  We received the highest score possible. (9)  We are being considered as a possible "10" school by 
the end of the year, which is the highest honor and rating in our district for facilities.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAAS
PP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through ei
ght and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant
 
cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or prog
rams 
of study.

dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who par
ticipated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; 
however, the number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievem
ent level percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Our School Safety 
Team is comprised of our principal, assistant principal staff members representing primary and 
intermediate grades, and both certificated and classified support staff. The team has met over the past several years to 
develop written procedures for drop
-
off 
and pick
-
up of students, after having identified our parking lots as an area of 
focus. The team also discussed procedures for lunch, procedures for the use of restrooms, standards of behavior in and 
around the school, and for recess activities. DVDs with p
rocedures for usage of playground facilities have been developed. 
These procedures were discussed with the full staff during teacher staff development days. 
 
 
Our school
-
wide reward system includes Lion of the Week, Academic Awards, Lion Heart Awards, Gold
en Can Award and 
assemblies for academic achievement. In addition, we have implemented a new program call HERO this year. Students 
earn points for positive behavior and the points are redeemed at our HERO store. 
 
 
Many other projects have been implemented 
to increase positive school climate for our La Rosa students and families. 
Some of the things done to create a positive, caring climate and provide positive behavioral support include: 
 

 
Certificates to display on classroom walls for each week a class has 
no referrals and/or suspensions. (Lion Pride 
Class Award)
 

 
Lion of the Week 
-
 
students from each class are recognized, they receive a pencil and a certificate with their 
picture.
 

 
Spirit Days include class and student rewards for participation.
 

 
Student Counc
il participation opportunities and activities.

School climate is also positively affected by our connections to the Community such as: 
 

 
Yearly participation in the Canned Food Drive
 

 
Yearly sponsorship of needy families (
Giving Tree)
 

 
Yearly participation in the Pennies for Patients Drive
 

 
Club 18 Community Services Projects (e.g community beautification projects, Christmas boxes for Soldiers,

2018 school year, 
the school site had planned 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional development days. We will continue to 
have the 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional development days.
 
 
Staff developm
ent is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for staff.  Grade level meeting and early release times are 
scheduled opportunities for teache
rs to collaborate, learn strategies, and develop action plans to meet identified student 
needs in their PLCs.
 
The district participates in BTSA and also has a team of highly qualified instructional coaches that support the classroom 
teachers in the impleme
ntation of curriculum and strategies.
 
There are also release days with coaches in order for grade levels to examine best practices as they implement curriculum.  
Site funds are also spent on conferences that focus on District and Site priority areas such a
s PLC Institutes, RTI, Grading 
Practices, etc.  The goal of all professional development is to increase student achievement.
 
 
Other Training Info: One hundred percent of La Rosa teachers meet the requirements for highly qualified staff. 18% of La 
Rosa Cert
ificated staff have completed Direct Instruction Training.
