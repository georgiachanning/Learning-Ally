School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a 
School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Loc
al Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with 
data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more 
information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members
 
should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At King Elementary we seek to create a safe learning enviro
nment where students can become confident, prepared life
-
long learners and leaders. We believe that collaboration and trust between students, staff, and parents can create an 
inclusive and nurturing place where all students can be successful.
 
 
We believe t
hat if students accomplish 90
-
120 minutes of purposeful reading and writing every day, we will see growth in 
all areas. The academic focus is on ensuring all students leave King Elementary reading at grade level with extra attention 
on our African American
 
and English Learner subgroups. This is accomplished through providing a cross
-
curricular rigorous 
program that is regularly monitored and adjusted using results orientated cycles of inquiry.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
WCCUSD takes great 
effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the school uses 
the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of California OPSC. Maintenance staff ensures that the repairs 
necessary to keep the scho
ol in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The school personnel also works 
daily with the custodial staff to deve
lop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative As
sessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate
 
in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who
 
have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

A primary goal of the professional development program is ensuring that all students are served by skilled, highly qualified 
teachers and that teachers are supported by strong, knowledgeable instructional leaders.
 
King staff is focusing on 
professional development in two areas: reading/writing and school climate. Our focus in reading/writing is supported by 
professional development in Teachers College Units of Study in Writing and ELD/ALD workshops. Teachers are at
tending 
professional development around increasing student discourse, specifically in academic language acquisition. School 
climate learning is supported through the Sanford Harmony curriculum and the work our Climate Team is doing around 
referral data ana
lysis using SWIS. Teachers attend professional development in regards to Restorative and Trauma
-
Informed Practices. Our Climate team is continuing to increase our learning around PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention 
and Supports) by attending workshops and
 
creating regular inhouse professional development. Teachers and staff are 
provided both onsite and offsite professional development offered by the district and outside school districts/agencies in 
all academics areas as well as professional development in
 
educational technology, differentiated instruction, classroom 
management, and how to use data effectively to improve instruction and student outcomes.
