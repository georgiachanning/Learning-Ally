By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

supports teaching the CA Common Core Math Standards.  Elementary grades use Eureka Math curriculum, which includes 

CPM curricu

Reading and Writing Units of Study to support reading and writing instruction for all teachers in grades K
-
8. The Reading 
and Writing Units of Study a
re aligned to the standrads and were designed to match the rigor of the new CA Reading and 
Writing Common Core Standards. The District also purchased classroom libraries for each grade level to support the 
diverse reading abilities in each classroom. Curri
culum was purchased to ensure students acquire the foundational reading 
skills needed for early literacy skills. Phonics, Spelling, & Word Study System by Fountas & Pinnell was purchased for grades
 
K
-
3 to help students attend to, learn about, and efficient
ly use sounds, letters, and words. In addition, Classroom Shared 
Reading materials by Fountas & Pinnell were purchased for grades K
-
2 to help build a strong early reading foundation. A 
process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of 
each school year for all students. In addition, there is 
a process to order additional materials throughout the year to address the changing needs of a schools student population, 

district staff when new students register for 
classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.  Our school complies with the Williams Law; every child has an 
appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbooks. Students are allowed to take t
extbooks home  to study 
after school when needed. The school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for classrooms 
including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD. Finally, WCSD has an establi
shed a 
thorough process for examining new instructional materials as they become available. With the full implementation of 
the California State Standards, the District will use the process to examine, explore, pilot and adopt new curriculum 
materials alig
ned with the CCSS, with input and feedback from teachers, administrators and parents. Based on the 

to ensure that the most appropriate material
s are identified for our students.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessm
ents for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in t
he administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have
 
successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Research shows that those children whose parents are involved in their education outperform and have a more positive 
school experience than those children whose parents do not actively participate in school.  Our 
PTA support in efforts to 
cultivate parent leaders and involve parents in classroom and school activities.  Parents are welcomed partners in every 
classroom and throughout the school.
 
 
Andrews works continuously to engage families in their child's educatio
nal trajectory.  Through various parent meetings 
and forums, parents study expectations for student learning across the curriculum.  To further connect parents to our 
academic instruction, Science, Math, and other curricular content Family Nights are plann
ed throughout the year.  Parents 
are also provided with weekly communication about school events and classroom news.
 
 
Additionally, various opportunities for parents to attend and participate in informational forums in which their input is 
solicited.  Pare
nts are given the opportunity to exercise decision making through various advisory meetings during School 
Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, and Parent Teacher Association meetings; each take place on a monthly 
basis.  These standing committ
ees also inform our parents about the school mandates, state initiatives, school funding 
and school accountability.  Parents involved in School Site Council, ELAC, and those at large are able to provide input in 
our school plan development, monitoring proc
ess, and other programs to implement throughout the school year using 
categorical funds.  Additionally, an evaluation template is utilized to evaluate the previous year's SPSA.  Goals and the 
funding for those goals are monitored, analyzed, and revised as 
needed to keep the school's achievement trajectory on 
an upward course.  A survey is sent home each year so that all parents can provide us with feedback regarding various 
initiatives that are offered at our school. Andrews is very fortunate to have parent
s who take an active role in our decision 
making and school community.  It is their support of school initiatives and their partnership that contributes greatly to our
 
continuous improvement.
 
 
We are fortunate to have strong community support 
through the PTA and active parent involvement in the classroom. 
Throughout the year Andrews School regularly invites parent participation.  At the beginning of the school year, every 
teacher is assigned a room parent who coordinates the involvement of othe
r parents in support of school programs. All 
of our parent volunteers enhance student success by working with small groups and individuals in the classroom, 
participating in fundraising activities, donating materials for classroom use, and sharing their ex
pertise with the entire 
school community. Along with other community members, they provide positive role models and support for children.  
PTA extends the partnership to parents by sponsoring many family
-

F
ather events, and after school sports. These events encourage parent participation in our academic programs.

School Safety Plan 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Andrews School is committed to the safety and security of each student. To maintain these conditions which contribute 
to the best possible learning environment, the School Safety Plan includes the following elements.
 
 
1. Child Abuse
 
Reporting: Teachers and other school employees are required by law to report any cases of suspected child 
abuse or child neglect. Reports are investigated by the Department of Social Services to determine if any follow
-
up on the 
report is necessary.  Trai
ning on Child Abuse Reporting and the resources available are given to staff each year.
 
 
2. Disaster Procedures: In order to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, the school safety committee has 
created a comprehensive Disaster Preparedness P
lan. Emergency drills are held once a month and evaluated for 
effectiveness.
 
 
3. School Discipline: The staff at Andrews School has created a school
-
wide discipline referral system to teach and maintain 
high standards for student behavior.  In addition, th
e Andrews staff implements a Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS) system, to maintain consistent behavior expectations throughout the school.
 
 
4. Sexual Harassment Policy: The staff at Andrews School strictly adheres to district policies which prohibit sexual 
harassment or discrimination of any kind. The sexual harassment policy is distributed to each student at the beginning of 
the school year, 
and employees are advised of their duty to take prompt action if they become aware of any incidents of 
sexual harassment.
 
 
5. Safe and Orderly Environment: The staff at Andrews School believes a safe and orderly environment is necessary to 
ensure a positiv
e learning experience for all students. Regular supervision of students is the core of creating and 
maintaining a safe and orderly environment. Teachers, administrators, campus supervisors, and parent volunteers 
consistently supervise and interact with stu
dents to reinforce behavioral expectations and safety standards.
 
 
6.  The safety plan was reviewed, updated and discussed with the faculty at the Opening Staff Meeting, as well as shared 
with stakeholder groups SSC and ELAC.  We continuously revisit and up
date our school plan as we practice our drills 
throughout the year.
 
 
Lastly, a strong partnership exists between our local law enforcement.  Local law enforcement agencies provide ongoing 
support to the school, and work with school site and district person
nel in cases of campus or neighborhood threats.
