School Description
 
Thomas A. Edison Elementary School (Edison) is located on Orange Avenue, east of South Main 
Street and north of East Warner Avenue. 
 
 
Edison is a completely renovated and modernized facility. All portable classrooms have been 
replaced by two, two
-
story bui
ldings containing 24 classrooms. The original buildings built in 1937 
and 1951 have also been modernized. A staff parking lot has been added as well as new landscaping 
throughout the entire campus. All classrooms have a complete technology package that inc
lude 
Smart Boards/Clevertouch Interactive Boards, LCD projectors, Avermedia projectors, computers, 
and ipads for students and teachers. The school also has three computer labs and one
-
to
-
one 
chrome books in grade 2
-
5. Edison is well equipped to prepare our
 
students for college and career 
in the 21st Century. 
 
 
Edison incorporates 8 Keys of Excellence to increase student motivation by creating a positive 
school climate. By applying the 8 keys of success daily, students develop the skills needed for 
success i
n their academic and personal lives along with the development of leadership 
characteristics. Our goal is to help all students find their own leadership abilities that they can apply 
throughout their lives. These leadership skills will prepare our students
 
to communicate with 
others, work collaboratively, and to be proactive and always have a plan. Students are given many 
opportunities in and out of the classroom to apply and practice their leadership skills throughout 
the day. Along with the 8 Keys of Exce
llence, we incorporate Positive Behavioral Interventions and 
Supports (PBIS). This is a decision making framework that guides selection, integration, and 
implementation of the best evidence
-
based academic and behavioral practices for improving 
important ac
ademic and behavior outcomes for all students. Edison received Platinum status in the 
implementation of the program goals. Edison embeds the AVID framework and strategies to 
accelerate learning growth and ensure all students are college ready. A SAUSD Dist
rict Run after
-
school program (Engaged 360) is available for Edison's students in grades K
-
5 between 2:05 p.m. 
and 6:00 p.m. A portion of this time is devoted to homework completion and tutoring. The 
remaining time is spent engaging students in fun, organi
zed activities and structured enrichment 
programs (music, dance, art, physical activity, etc.). Edison also offers a Head Start preschool 
program on campus. Preschool students are prepared with early literacy skills so they will enter 
kindergarten ready to
 
learn. 
 
 
School Motto: Working collaboratively to ensure every student achieves academically, socially, and 
emotionally.
 
 
Edison Elementary School Mission Statement:
 
 
To develop students ready for the 21st century who knows how to:

Show ini
tiative and creativity
 

 
Set goals and meet them

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, 
every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) al
l local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to me
et annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities.
 
Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.

maintained and kept 
safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. Maintenan
ce and Operations (M&O) employs an electronic work order system enabling school staff 
to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. Most of the school's repairs and maintenan
ce projects are 

ighly qualified, professional trade specialists. Emergency situations are immediately resolved either by the school custodian
 
or district maintenance staff, based upon the nature of the situation. Day and evening custodians work closely as a team and 
with 
the principal for routine 
maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events preparations. The principal and day custodian communicate daily to di
scuss campus cleaning 
needs and safety concerns. Every morning before school begins, the custodian and pr
incipal inspect facilities for safety hazards, graffiti, and other 
conditions that require removal prior to students and staff entering school grounds. School safety and cleanliness are the cu

strongly emphasized as a componen

chemicals, and use of equipment. The day custodians are responsible for following an established set of cleaning standards an
d prioritization pr
ocedures 
for general campus maintenance. The day custodian checks restrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities w
ell stocked, safe, and 
sanitary. The evening custodians are responsible for thorough cleaning of classrooms, office areas,
 
and restrooms. Groundskeepers are dispatched by 
the district office to perform general maintenance of landscaping, gardening, sports fields, and irrigation systems.

education population and the Californi
a Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parents are encouraged to get involved in Edison Elementary School's learning community by volunteering their time, attending
 
school events, and 
sharing in the decision
-
making process. Edison welcomes assistance in the classro
om, library, and all school activities and programs. A vibrant 
school/parent partnership is emphasized and this relationship is what makes Edison School a special place to ensure the succe
ss of each student. 
Parents are encouraged to participate in many pa
rent activities on the campus through Edison's Wellness Center which include: Zumba and Exercise 
class, crochet class, ESL, nutrition class, art therapy, etc. These ongoing programs support health and wellness for Edison f
amilies and community.

Edison provides Parent Education Opportunities that consist of weekly classes focused on Early Literacy and nutrition classes
. ESL classes for parents 
are on campus four days a week for interested families and commun
ity. Monthly parent workshops are provided throughout the school year focused 
on literacy and academic engagement of students. All parents are welcome to volunteer at school to support their children and
 
teachers throughout

The 
Edison staff and parents work together with the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the Santa Ana Police Department and
 
the SAUSD School 
Police Department to bring our 5th grade students a Gang Reduction Intervention Program (GRIP). Volunteers from t
hese departments meet regularly 
with staff, parents and 5th grade students to educate all on how to stay safe in their community. Parents are taught how to i
dentify if their child is 
getting involved in the wrong groups and how to monitor students for safe
 
use of the internet. Students are taught how to deal with bullying and gang 
recruitment. Students are motivated by the team to stay in school and focus on their goals. Our GRIP team also created a grou
p of parents called 
Greeters. These parents station th
emselves on the streets approaching the school to welcome students and wish them a great day. Greeters provide 
additional supports around our school neighborhood for our students' safety.
 
 
The following campus organizations provide opportunities for parent
