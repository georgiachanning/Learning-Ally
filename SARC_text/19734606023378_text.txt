About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information 
about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they inte
nd to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirement
s, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
All textbooks used in the core curriculum at Evergreen Elementary School are aligned to the Californ
ia Content Standards and Frameworks. Instructional 
materials are selected from the state's most recent list of standards
-
based materials and adopted by the State Board of Education. The district follows 
the State Board of Education's six
-
year adoption cycl
e for core content materials (English/language arts, math, science, and social science).
 
 
On Wednesday, September 18, 2019, the Walnut Valley Unified School District's Board of Trustees held a public hearing to cert
ify the extent to which 
textbooks and ins
tructional materials have been provided to students. The Board of Trustees adopted Resolution #20
-
01 which certifies as required by 
Education Code ยง60119 (1) that textbooks and instructional materials were provided to all students, including English learne
rs, in the district to the extent 
that each pupil in grades six through twelve has a textbook or instructional materials, or both, to use in class and to take 
home, and (2) sufficient textbooks 
and instructional materials were provided to each student, inc
luding English learners, that are aligned to the academic content standards and consistent 
with the cycles and content of the curriculum frameworks in math, science, history
-
social science, and English/language arts.  In grades TK through five, 
this is lim
ited to one textbook for each student.
 
 
In addition to core subject areas, districts are required to disclose in their SARCs the sufficiency of instructional materia
ls used for their visual/performing 
arts curricula. Evergreen, as a California Exemplary Ar
ts Award school, uses a variety of instructional materials in our award winning visual/performing 
arts program.

general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the 
CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
