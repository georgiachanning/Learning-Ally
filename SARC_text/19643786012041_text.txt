By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

BADILLO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MISSION
 
Badillo is a neighborhood school committed to the academic, emotional and intellectual well
-
being of each student.
 
 
BADILLO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PROFILE
 
Badillo Elementary School is a small, 
neighborhood school with an enrollment of 445 students. Our student population 
represents the diversity found throughout Southern California, and we celebrate that diversity by honoring and respecting 
one another. Our dedicated and caring staff is committe
d to the educational achievement of all our students, and to their 
intellectual and emotional well
-

to providing an education that makes college an option for our students

using State adopted textbooks that are aligned with the state framework and state standards. Classroom instruction is 
provided by appropriately credentialed teachers  (twenty
-
one full
-
time positions) an
d supported by four special education 
instructional assistants, six special education health/instructional assistants, three instructional assistants and two 
Language Development Assistants. Teachers meet regularly to refine instruction, maintain unity of 
curriculum and rigor, 
and share materials and ideas.
 
 
All students are assessed in a variety of ways through formative and summative assessments. All students take the i
-
Ready 
math and reading diagnostic test at the beginning of each trimester.  The CAASPP
 
Assessment tests are administered to 
all third through sixth grade students. Textbook assessments, teacher
-
created tests, and informal observations are all 
methods by which student strengths and needs are identified. Additionally, the ELPAC test is given 
to all second language 
students identified as such on the Home Language Survey. Testing for the Gifted And Talented Education (GATE) program 
is based on teacher and/or District recommendation, parent request, and/or CAASPP results.
 
 
Interventions to suppor
t student needs take many forms. In class, teachers provide small group and individualized 
instruction for targeted students. Second language learners receive extra aide support, enriched vocabulary activities, 
access to Spanish language library books, and
 
teacher led, specific English Language Development (ELD) instruction, on a 
daily basis. The Student Success Team (SST) meets bi
-
monthly to provide instructional suggestions for teachers, Multi
-
tier 
systems of support (MTSS) strategies, and/or to offer beh
avior modification plans for students. Intervention Teachers 
work with our most at
-
risk students to provide small group instruction for 50 minutes, two, three or four days a week 
before, during and after school, on targeted needs.
 
 
Staff 
development occurs during identified minimum days and at staff meetings. In
-
service topics have included: 
Benchmark ELD; SDAIE strategies; effective instructional practices; technology, assessment; curriculum development 
strategies; Positive Behavior Strat
egies; AVID best practices; i
-
Ready reading and math; Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC); and Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Topic selections are based on staff  needs, student 
performance and changes in state and district expectations. Additiona
l training for staff is available through various 
workshops and conferences offered in the area. This year is Badillo's sixth year implementing Advancement Via Individual 
Determination (AVID) Elementary. All TK
-
6th grade general education teachers received
 
extensive training and are 
implementing AVID strategies in their classrooms. The instructional program is supported in a variety of ways.

Technology supports instruction through a computer lab, chromebooks are utilized  in all Kindergarten
-
6th grade 
class
rooms, two laptop carts, desktop computers, iPads, and SMART Boards in all of the classrooms. Software and Internet 
programs provide enrichment, remediation, and guided practice for all students. i
-
Ready Reading and Math, Accelerated 
Reader (AR), Reading E
ggs, Mindplay and Rosetta Stone (for our non
-
Englishspeakers) are programs students use on a 
regular basis to improve achievement and to provide ongoing feedback to staff and parents. All students, regardless of 
gender, ethnicity, language, or special need
s are provided the opportunity to participate in such activities as Red Ribbon 
Week, Talent Show, Young Rembrandts and Student Council. All students in fourth through sixth grade participate in a 
weekly elementary choir program.
 
 
Badillo has Specialized Ac
ademic Instruction (SAI) classes provided for kindergarten through sixth grade students who 
require additional assistance to access the curriculum. An instructional aide assists the SAI teacher, allowing for the 
development of individualized programs tailo
red to the needs of each student in the class. When appropriate, students 
are mainstreamed into the general education classrooms. In addition, Badillo has two Autistic Spectrum Disorder 
Intermediate (ASDI) classes provided for kindergarten through sixth gr
ade students. Health/Instructional Assistants work 
with the teachers in the classrooms. Both ASDI and SAI students have the same access as their general education peers to 
all assemblies and other site activities, including physical education, fine arts, c
omputer lab, and library. Other services 
provided on
-
site include Adaptive Physical Education, Speech and Language Services, Deaf and Hard of Hearing services, 
Visual Impairment services, and Occupational Therapy.
 
 
Badillo has a Transitional Kindergarten (
TK) class for those students who will not turn five years old until after September 
1st. This exciting opportunity provides a developmentally appropriate educational experience to students who are not 
ready for the rigors of kindergarten, but are too advan
ced for a traditional preschool.
 
 
To educate the whole child takes a team and we depend on our parents and community members to team with us. Parent 
and community participation to support instruction, provide additional materials, and enrich the educationa
l experiences 
of all students includes volunteering in classrooms, office, workroom and in the library, serving on the Parent, Teacher 
Association (PTA), English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC), 
and 
School Site Council (SSC).
 
 
Our PTA is integral to the successes and educational adventure of our students. The hardworking PTA members provide 
exciting educational and enrichment events for our students, as well as the buses for field trips. This year our
 
students will 
participate in the Harvest Festival, Jog
-
A
-
Thon, Parent/Son Night, Parent/Daughter Night, Book Fairs, Winter Wonderland, 
Family Reading Night, Family Math Night, Family Science Night, Reflections, and various assemblies. Annually, our studen
ts 
participate in a Variety Show which highlights their creativity.
 
 
Procedures and policies related to complaint procedures, safe and drug free schools, and gender equity are outlined in 

icy manual, and the school website. Informational 
programs related to the above topics and other parent education issues are offered throughout the district, including at 
this school. These programs may be offered during the morning hours, after school, an
d in the evenings. These meetings 
are advertised through parent newsletters, District and school websites, the school marquee, announcements at various 
parent organization meetings, through District mailed brochures, and the District message system.

Badill
o Elementary School is committed to providing a safe school environment where student achievement is celebrated. 
The school discipline plan provides expectations in which students are held accountable to behave in an appropriate 
manner. Students are taught
 
to ROAR: be Respectful, Organized, Always safe, Responsible. Utilizing Office Discipline 
Referral forms (ODR), minor and major infraction data is entered in AERIES and reviewed by our leadership team and staff 
to learn when and where negative behaviors ar
e occurring so that they can be addressed and, hopefully, eliminated or at 

rewarded for good behavior with ROAR tickets. Each week stu
dents are recognized for ROARing. Students have the option 
of saving their ROAR coupons to use at our ROAR store to purchase various items from school supplies to toys or they may 
turn their tickets into the ROAR bucket in the office. The Principal draws f
our names each week. These students come to 
the office and get to select a prize, get their picture taken and have their names displayed on our marquee. Each month 
students are recognized at our Spirit Assembly for ROARing in their classroom. These student
s are invited to a pizza and 
game lunch with the Principal. We also recognize perfect attendance and being on track to meet their individual reading 
goals monthly.  Each trimester academics and behavior/study habits are celebrated at our honor roll assembl
ies.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Badillo Elementary School is named after two brothers, Julian and Antonio Badillo, coffee bean farmers from Costa Rica 
who came to Covina, in 1857 to establish a coffee plantation. Badillo was built in 1957 and ope
ned in 1958. In 2007, Badillo 
was modernized and brought up to code for ADA Compliance. We also added safety doors, new windows, upgraded tile 
floors, new carpet and paint, and technology upgrades. Last year, Badillo got a new paint job and a shade structu
re with 
picnic tables on our playground.
 
 
Badillo has 19 classrooms, a speech room, a music room, a STEAM room, an ELD room, a staff room, a work room, a 
textbook storage room, a counseling room, a library, a computer lab, and a daycare room. Our school fa
cilities are in good 
repair. The staff and district maintenance department work together to provide ongoing repair and improvement of the 

spr
inkler system, and new HVAC system in the school cafeteria, an electronic message board, and new outdoor lights.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and

Parents and community volunteers are an integral part of Badillo. Each day, we have at least twenty
-
five parent and 
community volunteers who help in our classrooms. We have an active Parent, Teacher Association (PTA) that includes 
parents, staff members an
d the principal. The PTA provides numerous services for our students including: Red Ribbon 
Week activities; Parent/Child Nights, such as Parent/Daughter Tea and Parent/Son Game Night; Harvest Festival; Jog

Thon; Family Reading and Family Math Nights;; Bo
ok Fairs; Reflections; Founders Night; and field trip buses. The PTA also 
hosts events for the staff such as the Welcome Back Breakfast and Staff Appreciation Week recognition. Recognizing that 
reading is key to success, the PTA helps to sponsor our Accele
rated Reader (AR) Incentive Program. All students who meet 
their AR goals for the year are awarded an AR t

The English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) is a well
-
represented group of parents who meet monthly to talk about 
and plan upcoming events
. ELAC assists our PTA with many of their services. The School Site Council (SSC) is comprised of 
parents, certificated and classified staff, and the principal. The SSC meets monthly  to draft, review, and approve our 
programs and our budget in our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement  (SPSA).

support the school with donations and opportunities to raise money for special events. Local churches provide supplies 
and backpacks for many of our students. The Masonic Home, which is located across the street from Badillo, has prov
ided 
meals for some of our families at holiday times, personnel to help us organize the textbook bin and  paint murals in the 
Friendship Room. Communication between the school and home helps us to build teams with our families. A weekly 
parent bulletin and
 
a Badillo calendar are sent home  informing the parents of current happenings and upcoming events. 
Blackboard (an automatic calling, texting, email system) and CLass Dojo are used regularly to provide families with 
information. Badillo has a marquee which
 
is updated weekly with information. Teachers send home weekly newsletters 
and communicate with parents through email, Class Dojo, notes, school agendas, telephone, and in person. Our Badillo 
website can be accessed through www.cousd.net then select the sc
hool tab. Parents are invited, by phone, to monthly 
Spirit Assemblies when students are recognized for ROARing and meeting reading goals, as well as honor roll assemblies. 
They are also invited to classroom and grade level performances.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The staff at Badillo believes that teaching and promoting safety is the number one priority. Students and staff must feel 
safe or learning will not occur. Badillo has a safety committee which meets four times during the academic year. A school 
disaster pre
paredness plan is in place and the committee reviews, updates and modifies the plan each year. In August, 
each teacher receives an up
-
to
-
date Emergency Handbook which is reviewed at the first staff meeting. Each month the 
entire school participates in a fi
re, earthquake, lockdown or intruder drill. During these drills the safety committee takes 
notes and makes adjustments as necessary. In October, Badillo participates in the Great California Shake
-
Out drill along 
with the rest of the school district. We use
 
this opportunity to conduct a simulated earthquake drill with the staff, students 
and parents.
 
 

alcohol. We have adult supervision dur
ing each recess and before and after school. Families review our school safety 
procedures in the school handbook which they can receive as a hard copy or access on our webpage. Parents are also 
encouraged to develop their own plans for safety and communica
tion in the event an emergency occurs. The school safety 
committee also conducts safety walks to look for potential hazards on the school grounds. All safety issues at Badillo are 
addressed immediately. Signs are posted at key places around campus to remin
d visitors that they are required to sign in
