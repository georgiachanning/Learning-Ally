School Description
 
Vision Statement:  "High 
expectations, Optimal Learning Environments."
 
 
Mission Statement:  Sierra Elementary is a school committed to educational excellence, 
empowering all young people to reach their full potential. Our school, in partnership with the 
community, will prepare stu
dents for the future as responsible citizens and lifelong learners.
 
 
The following are the focus behavioral skills outlined in the school's Positive Behavioral 
Interventions & Supports (PBIS) plan:  Responsible, Respectful and Safe.
 
 
Students meet school w
ide each morning and recite the Pledge of Allegiance along with the Roody 
Roadrunner Pledge. A PBIS plan is in place where students can earn Blue Roodies for exhibiting 
these character traits throughout campus. There is weekly recognition at Friday morning
 
assemblies and monthly recognition for model students in each grade level at the Student of the 
Month assemblies. Attendance incentives are also given at regular intervals.
 
 
Our Sierra Elementary staff further supports the development of socio
-
emotional s
afety conducive 
to learning with its delivery or Second Step curriculum instruction and implementation of Capturing 
Kids' Hearts processes.  Our CKH implementation is focused on maintaining an environment in 
which positive relationships are developed, wher
e relational connectedness between staff, 
students and families is nurtured, and students are eager to learn.
 
 
Schoolwide Focus/Broad Course of Study:  We at Sierra Elementary are committed to offering 
students an enriched curriculum with a variety of educ
ational avenues. In every grade level, we are 
committed to making sure our students learn and appreciate different elements of the Visual and 
Performing Arts.
 
 
School Profile: Sierra School offers a K
-
5 educational program in a modified traditional year. T
he 
school consists of the principal, an assistant principals, a school counselor, a school psychologist, 
29 certificated teachers, and 35 classified staff members. Sierra serves a student population of 
approximately 630 students. In our general education c
lasses 
-
 
Transitional 
Kindergarten/Kindergarten through 2nd grade 

 
each class has a maximum of 30 students per class. 
Third through fifth grade classes have a maximum of 35 students per class.  Additionally, we have 
three special day classrooms.
 
 
Sierra S
chool has adopted rigorous curriculum goals that include an emphasis on all students 
receiving standards
-
based curriculum. The Sierra teachers and support staff provide instruction 
based on the California Common Core State Standards. Grade level formative 
assessments (at least 
every 8
-
week period) and summative assessments are administered and analyzed to inform 
instruction and monitor student progress. The results of these assessments provide a strong 
emphasis on assessment
-
based instruction and standardiz
ing instructional practices.  Sierra staff 
believe that our instructional focus on grade level standards, our alignment of curriculum to the 
state standards, our attention to time
-
on
-
task, our implementation of effective instructional 
strategies (good firs
t instruction) and ongoing assessments will contribute to student achievement 
gains at Sierra.

English Learners (EL) are provided a regular classroom education program designed for English Language Development. Certifica
ted 
personnel prov
ide instruction using academic vocabulary, SDAIE and GLAD strategies. Teachers with EL students work in conjunction with 
the site instructional coach to address the students' needs. There is one bilingual para
-
educator who supports students and administers
 
mandatory state testing for second language learners. We have a bilingual office assistant in the front office to help parent
s communicate 
effectively with the school, and most of our memos and parent communication is disseminated in English and Spanish.
 
 
Students with identified learning disabilities have a current Individual Education Program (IEP) which addresses their unique
 
educational 
needs. Sierra's special education students have complete access to the core curriculum through the coordinated delive
ry of instruction in 
the regular classroom. Classroom program modifications/accommodations are coordinated between the classroom teacher and the 
resource teacher. GATE students are afforded ample opportunities for creative thinking. GATE students receive e
nrichment and 
differentiated curriculum within the general education classrooms.
 
 
Sierra School has a Visual & Performing Arts (VAPA) focus.  Teachers have participated in TEAL/Technology Enhanced Arts Learn
ing 
professional development and integrate art th
roughout curriculum to increase students access to content. Select teachers throughout 
campus work with Annenberg Grant artist to further integrate art into core curriculum. Grade levels 2 through 5 participate i
n a weekly 
music program with a credentialed
 
music teacher.   Sierra students also have access to VAPA enrichment programs including: Sierra Soul 
Steppers, Ukulele Strummers, and Good Vibrations choir.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each y
ear, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCF
F) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priori
ties. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical
