School Description
 
Robert Sanders Elementary School is situated in a residential community near the east foothills of 
San Jose. There are 18 classes for students from TK/Kindergarten through sixth grade consisting of 
both general education and special education classes (Spec
ial Day Classes: one K
-
2, 3
-
4, 5
-
6 and a 
SH
-
SDC 3rd
-
6th and a County Office of Education Severely Emotionally Disabled class). In addition, 
we have a district
-
wide preschool (Headstart) located on our campus. We have an ethnically diverse 
student body with
 
an approximate school population of 425 students.
 
 
Our mission is to create an atmosphere of continuous social and academic growth, where personal 
responsibility, respect, and effort are valued in a safe, supportive, and motivating community.  Our 
Vision 
is "All students will grow..."
 
 
Curriculum and Instruction:  We are in our third year of becoming an Elementary AVID school, 
where our AVID  (Advancement Via Individual Determination) mission is to close the achievement 
gap by preparing all students for co
llege readiness and success in a global society.  We are 
implementing strategies and skills beginning in TK/ Kindergarten that will prepare our students for 
academic success, through college and career readiness skills.  Our students get to experience 
tech
nology through our mobile labs. We provide additional academic support to our students 
through an Intervention teacher after differentiated instruction.   We have counselors and a part 
time family case manager to support our students and families. Robert S
anders teachers offer 
comprehensive and thematic lessons in language arts, math, science, and social studies through 
the use of Project Based Learning.  All students participate in art and music provided throughout 
the year by credentialed teachers, and st
udents in the upper grades are offered music lessons once 
a week with a credentialed music teacher. Through project
-
based learning and our EL Curriculum, 
students tackle a challenging academic curriculum in ways that are engaging, meaningful, and 
adaptable
 
to a variety of learning styles. Our curriculum is tied to the Common Core State 
Standards. Kindergarten
-
2nd grade are participating in our reading curriculum of Fountas and 
Pinnell, which is a guided reading program where students work at their individua
l levels through 
small group reading instruction.  Report Cards are provided to parents three times a year. 
Standardized test results are provided to parents as soon as the State sends them to the district 
(CAASPP).  Student assessment data is gathered eve
ry year using standardized test results and 
benchmark assessments.  We also offer Science Camp for our 5th grade students where they can 
experience science first
-
hand by living in the environment, and are able to apply learning from their 
classroom instruc
tion.
 
 
Response to Intervention (RtI):  We identify students at risk through our RtI process and hold 
Student Success Team (SST) meetings with their parents, classroom teacher, our intervention 
teacher, counselors, principal and psychologist. We determine 
what the student needs with input 
from all stake
-
holders and create a plan to help the student succeed. All decisions and plans are 
based on data.  Our intervention teacher works with our academic highest at
-
risk students in need 
of extra support, and afte
r a given time of support, we meet again to see the outcome of our plan.  
Some teachers offer after school interventions in both Math and ELA.  We are also offering Elevate 
math support to selected 3rd grade students, and Math and Reading after school inte
rventions to 
all students who participate in our after school program (MPAS).

After School Program:  We have the Mount Pleasant After School (MPAS) program that serves approximately one hundred twenty 
students from dismis
sal to 6 p.m. in grades Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade. This program provides a homework club, physical 
activities, enrichment and a sports program. We are also offering a free based admission to MPAS for families who only want t
heir children 
on 
campus for a shorter amount of time each day.
 
 
School Discipline:  We are proud of our school and its commitment to quality education. We have high expectations and believe
 
that all 
children can and will learn. Our discipline is fair, consistent and 
research based. Our school adopted the BEST Behavior framework to 
model positive behavior for our students, and base everything on three principles:  Be Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be Saf
e.  We 
promote a sense of school pride in all students by recogni
zing student achievement and progress.  We focus on making our school a 
positive learning environment in order to set the foundation for student achievement.
 
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each 
year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local prior
ities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/g
uardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunit
ies for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Robert Sanders Elementary School is a community school. Throughout the year our doors are open for parent involvement.  Paren
ts are visible on campus, 
and you will see parents and community members suppo
rting our students and staff daily.
 
 
Our PTA is active and meets several times a year for a formal meeting, and collaborate regularly to discuss upcoming events a
nd our academic program. 
They have schoolwide events such as the Pumpkin Patch,  End of the Ye
ar Carnival, Family Movie and Craft Nights, Science Nights. We strive to offer 
activities that allow for families to be involved in our school and their child's education. Parents volunteer during the day
 
in the classrooms, library, on 
the playground, in t
he office and on field trips.
 
 
We also have an active School Site Council that monitors the Single School Plan and school budgets. We have an active distric
t
-
wide English Language 
Advisory Committee, and we meet 4 times a year. At the end of the school yea
r we have a Parent Volunteer Tea to recognize all our volunteers.
 
 
The Proud Parenting Program (Triple P) has been available to our families which offers families two opportunities for support
 

 
Case Management and a 
Parenting Workshop Series. Parents can 
participate in a ten
-
session standard model or in an eight
-
session group format.

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Robert Sanders Elementary School believes in the philosophies behind the Peacebuilder program.  We have also incorporated BES
T practices (PBIS
-
Positive Behavior Intervention and 
Supports), and focus on three overall expectations (Be Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be Safe). Our School provides 
a safe and engaging learning environment. We have various preventive efforts such as activities that focus on improving our s
chool climate.
 
Students are 
recognized for good attendance, demonstrating PeaceBuilder/BEST principles, and academic success through out the year.
 
 
In order to enhance and compliment our PeaceBuilder program, we also implement the BEST (PBIS) behavior program. A team of
 
administrators, classified 
and teachers continue to attend the BEST trainings.   The BEST team continues to present key ideas to the Leadership Team and
 
the staff. Our district 
continues to receive ongoing trainings in the Best Behavior Program, a positiv
e behavior program that provides intervention techniques based on 
research in school discipline. The program addresses schoolwide, common areas, classroom, and individual student intervention
. Our staff has worked 
together to define schoolwide expectations
-
 
be respectful, be responsible and be safe. Together we have agreed upon common language to use and 
have directly taught our students what these expectations are and what they look like for all areas of the school. On going t
raining and implementation 
wil
l occur through out the next school year.
 
 
We have after school programs to provide additional supervision and support for our students. The Mt. Pleasant Afterschool Pr
ogram (MPAS) enrolls 
approximately 130 students. This program provides a homework center
, enrichment activities, and sports programs.
 
 
Robert Sanders provides a safe and engaging learning environment for all of our students. The district installed a 180 degree
 
camera to monitor our 
campus. Cameras were installed in the front office for added 
security.The facility is surveyed daily for any safety concerns including graffiti and issues are 
promptly resolved. Emergency drills are held monthly to ensure students know and can use safety procedures in case of a fire 
or earthquake. School 
safety dril
ls, where students practice what to do in case of an intruder on campus, are held two times per year.
 
 
Comprehensive Safe School Plan was last reviewed with committee on  3/25/19.

The Mt. Pleasant School District has consistently focused its staff development efforts to address the needs of the students 
and teachers to increase 
student achievement. In the past three years, the professional developm
ent for teachers has been to support teachers with the implementation of the 
newly adopted English Language Arts and Mathematics curriculum. Below are examples of the professional development that the d

*Our AVID teachers provide ongoing professional development on AVID strategies throughout the year.
 
 
All Grades reviewed essential components
 
of Project Based Learning (PBL). Teachers received guided support to work collaboratively with grade level 
peers and departments to develop a PBL unit that is culturally relevant to the students/communities that we serve. The PBL in

C
itizenship standards to help students understand their role as global citizens who respect and value diversity, understanding
 
social justice, work with 
others to make the world around them more equitable, and help students take responsibility for their act
ions.
