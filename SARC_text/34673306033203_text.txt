By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subje
cts for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for
 
use by the State are reviewed by all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to
 
adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Mather Heights Elementary was originally constructed in 1959, and was modernized in 2000.  It is comprised of 18 
classrooms, one multipurpose room, 
library, staff lounge, computer lab, stage area, and three playgrounds. Remodeling 
in 2000 included new A/C system, new ceilings, wall coverings, carpet, built in cabinets and work stations, new office 
configuration, grounds, a computer lab, and a refinish
ed wooden gym floor. Our playgrounds were resurfaced and a new 
drainage system was installed during the summer of 2011. We were modernized again in the summer of 2014. New 
landscaping, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, and a new parking lot
 
and back parking lot are on the 
agenda.
 
 
Cleaning Process: Two full
-
time custodians, and one part
-
time custodian, ensure that the school is maintained to provide 
a clean and safe environment for students. The district governing board has adopted cleaning 
standards for all schools in 
the district. A summary of these standards are available at the district office for review.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair: District maintenance staff ensures that the work orders and repairs necessary to keep the school 
in good repai
r are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest 
priority is given to emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported 
in the inspection process. 
The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remediation.  The 
district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with 
expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 

verning board did approve deferred maintenance projects for 
the school, which included working on windows, fields, playground structures, and the blacktop areas around campus.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Mather Heights Elementary participates in the district wide "Hour
-
Zero" school safety program. There were three (3) 
student accidents reported at our school in 
the 2018
-
19 school year. Our staff and students actively participate in drills 
and safety instruction. The district provides child safety monitors for our campus. All of our doors are locked at all times,
 
and visitors must report to the main office before 
coming on campus. All parent volunteers who work with students are 
Category 2 cleared. This includes fingerprinting and a clear Tuberculosis (TB) test. Visitors and staff members are required 
to wear identification badges.
 
 
We work with our Safe School Off
icers on ideas to make our campus a safer place for students and for staff. Campus drills 
and practice scenarios with our staff and students help us to prepare for real life events. Our site safety team helps us 
plan drills and they go over our Safe School
 
Plan. This plan is reviewed each fall and spring. Emergency plans have been 
developed in case a threatening situation should arise and emergency drills are practiced every two months. Fire drills are 
conducted monthly. The Emergency Plan is designed to gi
ve staff members and students guidance during emergency 
situations.

service and training are provided through our Professional Development  (PD), a model of lead teachers. In 
addition, our district staff has worked collaboratively to implement our Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program, whic

works in unison with BTSA (Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment) to provide an induction program for qualified 
new teachers.
 
 
Teachers regularly participate in professional development on implementation of our current math and English 
Language 
Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) curriculum, Professional Learning Communities (PLC), Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Supports, Every Child By Name (ECBN), and character education. When Professional Development is 
conducted during t
he school day, teachers are provided release time. It is also delivered on non
-
student days, and in after 
school workshops and during staff meetings. Teachers receive an average of six days of professional development per 
school year.  Additional professio
nal development needs arise from teachers working in Professional Learning 
Communities (PLC) to identify student needs and supports needed. The Principal supports teachers in their professional 
development and PLC work by providing time and resources neede

Additionally, teachers participate in trainings on mental health/suicide prevention and safety practices each year.
