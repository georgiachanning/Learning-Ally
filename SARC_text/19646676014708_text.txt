School Description
 
Linda Verde Elementary will provide options and excellence in education, empowering all students 
to reach their full potential. We will successfully implement and integrate the Common Core State 

 

 
Collaboration, Creativity, Critical 
Thinking, and Communication.  This implementation will be in all classrooms, in all grade levels, for 
all students and will result in increased student achievement and create 21st Century students who 
will successfull
y compete in our global society. In addition, Linda Verde currently offers a Dual 
Language Immersion program in Kindergarten through Fifth Grade.  Each year, an additional grade 
level will be added.  The Dual Language Immersion classes are a component of a
 
school wide 
Cultural Academy, which focuses on Multi
-
Culturalism and global awareness.
 
 
Linda Verde Elementary has a collaborative staff that effectively teaches state standards with best 
practices and techniques. We work to provide a supportive and succe

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law
 
to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to
 
prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
co
nsistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more inform
ation about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
General
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict uses a facility survey instrument 
developed by the Los Angeles County Office o
f Education. The results of this survey are available at the school office or at the district office.
 
 
School Buildings
 

s, staff lo
unge, cafeteria and 
library. There are 38 classrooms, 18 permanent and 20 re
-
locatable.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in a timely mann
er. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The district governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of
 
these standards is available at the district office. 
The Supervisor of Operations works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe sc
hool.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
Although the State no longer requires a Deferred Maintenance contribution, Lancaster School District is still dedicated to ma
intaining the facilities for 
our students.  These expenditures would include but not be limited to roofing, plumbing, heating, air 
conditioning, electrical, painting, and flooring.  For 
the 2019
-
20 school year, the district has budgeted $940,000 for deferred maintenance projects.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

statistical accuracy or to protect student 
privacy.
 
 
Note: ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative 

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number 
of students who participated in both assessments.
