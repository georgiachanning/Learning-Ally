Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Principal's message
 
 
At North Shore we strive for all students to
 
excel socially, emotionally, and academically. We work hard each day to 
provide students with the tools necessary to be successful in all aspects of life. This annual report card to the community 
provides valuable information regarding our instructional p
rograms, highly qualified staff, school facilities, and finances 
compared with other schools and districts within California.
 
 
 
 
At North Shore Elementary School, we have many knowledgeable and caring teachers and staff who are dedicated to 
making a differ
ence in the lives of every student. Through the implementation of a rigorous curriculum aligned with the 
California Content Standards, paired with the use of technology and the 21st Century fluencies of collaboration, 
communication, critical thinking and c
reativity, we provide our learners with a balanced, engaging environment in which 
to learn.
 
 
 
In addition to our academic focus, the use of Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) has provided our students 
with proactive strategies that have hel
ped develop confidence and self
-
discipline in each of our learners. The intentional 
focus on our school
-
wide goals of being responsible, being respectful, and being safe have helped foster a positive learning 


gifts of students through our intervention and enrichment program. We believe that helping students discover their 
passions supports their overall academic and personal success.
 
 
 
 
We value the work of collaboration of all stakeholders within our educational community. The work of our Professional 
Learning Communities, Eagle Boosters, School Site Council and English Language Advisory Council are all integral 
components of our student

provide a rich and meaningful educational experience that students will attain their dreams and become valuable, 
contributing members of society.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
