About the SARC
 
By February 1
 
of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Fo
rmula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and lo
cal priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, 
parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Teachers have been provided opportunities for professional development throughout the year.  The 
focus has been on preparing teachers for 
implementation of California  Standards in Math, English Language Arts, Science and English Language Development.  We have al
so focused on integration 
of technology as a resource in the classroom to teachers and stu
dents.  Teachers were also given release time throughout the school year to align 
curriculum and instruction to the state standards, prepare lessons and to collaborate with peers on best instructional practi
ces.  The District has a 
technology coach availab
le to support both student and teachers with technology.  In addition,  instructional coaches are available to support teache
rs 
in ELA , English Language Development, and Math.  Professional developments on a myriad of topics have supported teachers in 
cre
ating a learning 
experience which is both relevant and rigorous for students. Throughout the year, there are Effective Teacher workshop classe
s available which offer a 
new theme each month.  Themes vary from classroom management to reading instruction and 
using student data to drive instruction.   We will continue 
to provide professional development in coming years as we continue to implement the new science standards.
