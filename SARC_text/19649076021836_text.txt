By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Message from the Principal
 
The School Accountability Report Card (SARC) is one way to measure how a school stacks up in regard to the academic 
and other 
educational programs that it has in place. It was originally established in November 1988 by Proposition 98, an 
initiative passed by California voters. School boards for each public school in the state issue the SARC annually. It provide
s 
parents and other
 
interested people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and identifies 
areas where improvement is needed.
 
 
The theme this year at Golden Springs continues to be "Celebrate Learning". We are committed and united as school staff, 
parents and the community to raise the bar, prepare our students for higher learning, and to prepare our children for 
college. We are v
ery proud of our past, the present and look forward to the future. We attribute our success to the support 

dedicated instructional staff, PTO a
s well as community groups and individuals that volunteer their time and provide their 
financial support are major factor in our success. Our parents are awesome. The parents are involved with their students, 
attend Family PTO events and active partners in
 
Going Above and Beyond!

At Golden Springs, high priority is placed on improving student academic performance. We continually reevaluate our 

ng

values collaboration, planning and pacing the curriculum together at each grade level. The staff comes together regularly 
to brainsto
rm and evaluate its programs. In addition, technology has been integrated into the curriculum at all grade 
levels. Each classroom has a pod of four computers and the school has two computer labs.
 
 
Our curriculum focuses on the teaching of the Common Core S
tandards which expose each student to a wealth of 
information, which provides them with the opportunity to absorb a diverse range of knowledge, enabling them not only 
to master grade
-
level proficiency, but to also excel at a level appropriate to their indi
vidual ability. The philosophy at 
Golden Springs is to provide a balance curriculum which emphasizes core academic areas, art, music, physical education, 
and the teaching of values. Our talented, dedicated and creative instructional staff forms a strong co
llaborative team that 
brings out the best in each child. They consistently volunteer for professional development to enhance their teaching 
skills.
 
 
The overriding belief of our educators and support staff is to provide sound early education for our childr
en. At no other 
time in their development are they more receptive to our influence, guidance and care. We strive to provide our children 
with the gift of a solid foundation 
-
 
academically, socially and emotionally 
-
 
to not only realize their potential but 
also 
equip them to shape and attain their personal life desires and future goals.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

District and site professional development also includes trainings around 21st Century Teaching and Learning which 
include the California State S

teacher leaders to lead the transition and implementation of the California State Standards. Sessions include themes such 
as the need for a paradigm shift in teaching a
nd learning, the essential components of the P21 Framework, California State 
Standards, English Learner standards and framework, equity and culturally responsive instruction, social and emotional 
learning, and integrating the use of technology to enhance/s
