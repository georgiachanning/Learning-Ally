About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of
 
Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-

We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials.  We use a district
-
wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrat
ors.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004.  We report to the board in Septembe
r and four times a year 
about the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether w
e had a textbook for each student in each core 
course during the 2017
-
18 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify our facilities needs over the next deca
de. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
the Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bo
nd Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assist
 
with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program cal
led "Akita Box" is 
used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs th
e maintenance department 

 
 
Cy
press Elementary was built in the early 1940s. The school has 20 classrooms, a computer lab, library and main office. The off
ice was remodeled in 
order to create a friendly environment for our students, parents, and staff. We keep our central hallways and 
classrooms clean. Our playground is spacious 
and clean and provides a variety of recreational activities. Our Parent Club has upgraded our playground equipment. We have s
ix portable buildings that 
are on permanent foundations. We have a park
-
like quadrangl
e that is centrally located and provides a venue for performances. During 2010
-
2011 the 
school kitchen underwent a $270,000 re
-
modernization.  In 2014 perimeter security fencing was installed and the HVAC systems in all buildings except 
portables were retr
ofit with more
-
efficient gas fired units.  Lighting systems were also upgraded as part of Prop 39 work in 2014. In 2017 the site 
modernized a classroom for STEAM adding in a 3D printer and a collaborative workspace ideal for robotics and group activities
.
 
 
The school is staffed with one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and safe schools. The custo

which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a monthly basis the lead custodian uses a facility survey instrum
ent developed by the Northern 
California Schools Insurance to evaluate the co
nditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the District Facilities Department who then does 
an annual evaluation for the site.

School Safety Plan
 
District maintenance and our custodial staff inspect our playground equipment regularly. Staff members supervise the playgrou
nds at all four recesses, 
and students follow our 
playground safety guidelines, Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) that are discussed with each student the first w
eek 
of school, the first week of January and the week after spring break. Cypress has developed and implemented a Comprehensive S
ch
ool Safety Plan and 
a Crisis Management Plan covering all possible disaster scenarios. The safety plan is updated annually at the beginning of th
e school year. Staff and 
students practice regular emergency drills on a monthly basis. Visitors to our school 
are required to check in at the office and wear visitor identification 
badges while on campus.
 
 
Discipline
 
Our faculty is committed to maintaining a safe and orderly climate for learning. Our discipline plan is based on the BEST (Bu
ilding Effective Schools
 
Together) program. Students who are safe, respectful, and responsible receive a Cougar Coupon. Cypress school gives rewards e
ach week to students 
whose names are randomly drawn. Student achievement  is recognized at our three awards assemblies held at the
 
end of each trimester.

Types of Services Funded
 
We have received donations through Driscolls Foods, Winco Foods, the Scripps Howard, Rotary, and the City of Redding. Our Aft
er School Education and 
Safety grant allows us to provide a quality educational program until 6:00 p.m. daily. Additional state and
 
federal funding pays for a project technician 
whose responsibility is to assist in the school
-
wide intervention and enrichment program and to help teachers enter and retrieve all local and state 
assessment data. We also have a Instructional Coach/Title I 
teacher and two instructional assistants who help with student achievement in smaller 
intervention groups and closing of the achievement gap. The Instructional Coach develops afternoon math tutoring for second t
hrough fifth grades with 
the support of three
 
additional instructional aides. A Family Advocate is on site part time to assist with families in need of assistance to get s
tudents 
prepared for school.

this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that pr
ovides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enro
