By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement 
(School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The South County Consortium (SoCC) consists of the nine school districts in Petaluma (Petaluma Elementary and 
Secondary, Old Adobe, Waugh, Cinnabar, Two Rock, Wilmar, Dunham, and Two Rock). There are two programs: non
-
intensive pres
chool program and the preschool
-
high school program. The non
-
intensive preschool program includes 
services for students aged 3
-
5 whose primary disability is speech and language impairment. The array of services includes 
speech and language therapy only, sp
eech and language and occupational therapy, STRETCH program (4 days a week, for 
either 1.25 or 2 hours, and includes speech therapy, occupational therapy, and pre
-
academics). The SoCC preschool to 
high school program is for students with moderate to severe
 
disabilities. They receive the majority of their instruction in 
special day classes on various campuses in Petaluma. All additional services are provided within the class. The Lifeskills 
classes are heterogeneous and include students with autism, intellec
tual disabilities, and speech and language 
impairment. The therapeutic support program (TSP) is for students with emotional disabilities.
 
 
The mission of the South County Consortium is to support school districts and families in Petaluma and surrounding ar
eas 
by providing highly specialized programs for students in preschool through high school in their own communities. We 
support our students by providing integrative, individualized and strength based programs that foster communication, 
critical thinking, 
and technology skills. In collaboration with school teams, families, and community we assist students in 
gaining independence, achievement, and skills for becoming positive members of the community.
 
 
The 2018/2019 goals of the SoCC are to increase integrat
ion opportunities, continue to strengthen early integration, and 
increase technology opportunities to increase learning and engagement.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Career Technical Education Programs (School Year 2018

The students in the TSP program at the high school participate in the workability program and are able to take classes that 
support careers including Hatchery and other classes that are part of th
e career technical education (CTE) program (e.g. 
Digital Design, Culinary). Additionally, all students over the age of 16 have an individual transition plan. Goals are 
developed as part of this plan. The goals are tied to supporting career development. It 
can include resume writing and 
academics that are prep for college. Additionally, students are provided with information about the Department of 
Rehabilitation and disabilities resources at the Santa Rosa Junior College. In the Lifeskills program, students
 
participate in 
workability. They have a variety of jobs on campus and have a gardening project.
 
 
Students participate in pedestrian safety activities that support their transition to the county programs for 18
-
22 year 
olds. Additionally, parents and 
students are invited to the annual transition fair. The school team also works with the 
Department of Rehabilitation and North Bay Regional Center to prepare students for independent living and the 
workforce. Students over 16 have individual transition pla
ns. Goals are developed to prepare them for careers.

The South County Consortium (SoCC) teachers participate in staff development in a variety of ways. They are all under 
contract with Petaluma City Schools and they receive the same number of PD days. They participate in district offerings 
and in separate tr
ainings with the SoCC. Trainings are based on a needs assessment with our population. Some focus areas 
have been: best practices for students with autism, technology in the classroom to support instruction, mindfulness, 
reading instruction for students wit
h Downs Syndrome, transition planning social stories, behavioral support, legal 
updates, curriculum for students with moderate/severe disabilities, and IEP goal writing. The PD is done through 
workshops. In addition, teachers are supported and encouraged t
o attend conferences and trainings at the county office. 
We have established mentoring relationships among our staff which include face to face meetings, observations, and 
phone/text conversations. Teachers are supported through mentoring, coaching in clas
s, and teacher
-
director meetings.
