School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
McDowell Elementary School is a TK
-
6 school located in Petaluma, 40 miles north of San Francisco. Our school is one of 
seven elementary schools in the Petaluma City Elementary School District. We ar
e served by a board of education that 
also governs the Petaluma Joint High School District. McDowell serves approximately 260 students.
 
 

Peo
ple Services to a full time guidance specialist, from a free and confidential Family Resource Center to adult classes 
offered through Petaluma Adult School, McDowell is a place of care, community, and learning for all!  We also partner 
with organizations s
uch as Mentor Me and welcome volunteers to our campus.
 
 
Our school is dedicated to equipping students with 21st century skills of communication and critical thinking. Every student 
has access to an iPad for learning, where they are supported to learn vario
us apps and programs that support the 
development of these skills. Experienced teachers integrate problem
-
solving into their daily instruction, and promote 
student engagement through Academic Conversations (Zwiers and Crawford 2011).
 
 
McDowell students exp
erience a rich curriculum aligned with the Common Core State Standards. With over a century of 
experience between them, our wonderful classroom teachers differentiate and scaffold learning for their learners, 
realizing that all students have different stre
ngths and needs. Our English Learners benefit from integrated and designated 
language instruction, multiple bilingual staff, and social studies content embedded into weekly Spanish language classes. 
Our students with special needs and challenges are suppor
ted through intervention programs that provide push
-
in and 
small group support. All students at McDowell are supported to achieve!
 
 

prog
ram through principal newsletters, report cards, parent
-
teacher conferences, Parent Teacher Association (PTA) 
meetings, ELAC (English Learner Advisory Committee) meetings, and classroom newsletters. Some teachers communicate 
with parents via apps like Clas
s Dojo and Remind. Our fully bilingual front office staff helps our families stay connected to 
all the wonderful things happening on campus.
 
 
We are very united by our vision statement: All McDowell students are actively engaged learners and 
communicators. Our 
school community supports bi
-
literacy, compassion, critical thinking, academic achievement, and contribution to our 
global society.
 
 
Our school community is dedicated to our four core values: respect, responsibility, 
compassion, and perseverance.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students
 
who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety plan: The safety plan was last reviewed by School Site Council in 2019, and is on the agenda for review again in 
February 2020. It was updated to reflect more detailed protocols and RESIG recommended naming conventions, as well 
as procedures for Spe
cial Day Class students in the event of an evacuation. We identified areas of pride and strength, 

containment during school hours to ensure studen
t safety. Areas of improvement included updating emergency rosters, 
replenishing red emergency provisions bags for each classroom, and practicing drills at less common times and during less 
common activities.
 
 
Emergency Procedures: The McDowell School Safe
ty Plan, which includes an emergency procedures and operations plan, 
is reviewed by staff and parents at School Site Council meetings, and by staff at staff meetings. It incorporates all of the 
recommended procedures of the State and District. Monthly fire
 
and evacuation drills are held, with the other 4 other 
emergency protocols including shelter in place, drop cover hold on, and lockdown, practiced multiple times per year.
 
 
Student Uniform Policy: In Fall 2012 McDowell School adopted a school uniform poli
cy. The purpose of this policy is to 
ensure that clothing and footwear support student safety and success, and to encourage pride in our respectful and 
responsible community. The uniform policy is updated annually by School Site Council, and has included e
xemption 
options and a Friday free dress day since 2017.
 
 
Procedures for Safety of Students on Campus: Supervision of students begins at 7:55am in the Multi
-
purpose room for 
breakfast service. Supervision on the yard begins at 8:10 A.M. Students are superv
ised before, during (recess), and after 
school by teachers and classified staff on a rotating schedule. School employees supervise the playground and eating 
areas. Students are not permitted to leave school grounds during the school day, unless permission 
has been granted for 
field trips. Students arriving after the start of school must check in at the office. The campus is completely fenced and 

s must 
sign out students in the school office if leaving prior to the end of the normal school day. Parents are required to follow 
specific procedures for vehicular traffic when dropping off and picking up students. All of these procedures are included 
in 
the McDowell family guide and handbook.
 
 
Safe and Orderly Environment: Our belief is that the safest and most orderly environment results from students actively 
participating in their learning. To that end, teachers develop curriculum that meets 
instructional objectives, engages 
students, and includes processes for assessment and evaluation. Our teachers ensure that each student is part of our 
school community. We believe that students connected to the school are better citizens.
 
 
School Disciplin
e, Rules and Procedures: Students at McDowell exhibit behavior that is consistent with our four McDowell 

s 

wide behavioral expectations are established for students, and individual classroom rules are also 
established with the participation of the students. Strategies for promoting positive behavior include restorative problem
-
solving models utilized by princip
al and full
-
time guidance specialist, active communication among staff and families, and 
monthly recognition assemblies for our four McDowell values: respect, responsibility, compassion, and perseverance.
