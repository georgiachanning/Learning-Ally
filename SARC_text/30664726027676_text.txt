By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

In 2011, the Governor and State Legislature extended the suspension of State Board of Educa
tion (SBE) adoptions of 
instructional materials until the 2015

16 school year (Education Code Section 60200.7).  At this time the State has adopted 
frameworks for English Language Arts/ English Language Development, and math which will assist in our implem
entation 
of  California's Common Core State Standards. We are currently piloting  State Board of Education adopted (January, 2014) 
instructional materials for math to reflect the rigor of the California's Common Core State Standards, teachers are 
developin
g curricula units, and various resources are provided as additional instructional materials. The State Board of 
Education adopted ELA/ ELD instructional materials in November 2015  which directed our pilot and adoption of new 
instructional materials.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil 
Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California 
Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achi
evement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entranc
e to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Centralia School District welcomes and values 
parental involvement in District and school programs. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, CESD continued the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) process. This funding process requires 
school districts to engage parents, teacher, employee groups, and the
 
wider community to be a part of the development 
of the LCAP. Informational meetings were held with various stakeholders including Board members, parents, PTAs, and 
advisory groups (DELAC, GATE). The zenith of LCAP Committee meetings was the adoption of th
e 2019
-
2020 LCAP by the 
Board of Trustees. The LCAP represents an opportunity to further strengthen the commitments between our District and 
our community on behalf all of students. 
 
 
Centralia Elementary School is proud of its active and involved parent c
ommunity. Parents/guardians are invited to take 
an active role at Centralia School. There are four different groups with regularly scheduled opportunities for parents to 
provide leadership in our school.. The School Site Council (SSC) focuses on the annual
 
school goals and is responsible for 
the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA), as well as the final approval of the Safe School Action Plan. The English 
Language Advisory Council (ELAC) voted to combine with SSC, and offers input for parents/guardian
s of students who are 
learning English. The Safety team provides parents the opportunity to help design and implement our Safe School Action 
Plan. Lastly, our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) coordinates activities which support the school's programs and p
rovides 
support for all students. Centralia Elementary School parents are an integral part of our students' education and success. 
 
 
The school website provides information regarding all aspects of parental involvement. School Messenger messages are 
regula
rly sent and updates are posted on the school's Twitter page frequently to keep parents and families abreast of all 
school activities. Additionally, parents are encouraged to become classroom or office volunteers and greeters Our school

Programs and Services Available at Centralia to Support and Assist Students:
 
 
At Centralia School, the principal works with the school's leadership team and the School Site Council to develop the 
comprehensive School Plan for Student Achievement.  Through the LCAP, general funding, and Title I, the school has 
invested in a "within
-
d
ay" learning center model that supports students at the various RtI phases.  The Intervention 
Specialist teachers were hired to teach in the Learning Center with eligible at
-
risk students and they receive support in 
either English Language Arts and/or ELD 
support.  Three bilingual instructional assistants further support the language 
needs of English Learners.  One bilingual clerical specialist is available to provide primary language support and assistance
 
to parents of English Learners.  Many of our stude
nts are working towards grade level proficiency with our dedicated 
educators after school in an endeavor to close their achievement gap. The curriculum is directly aligned with state 
standards and the lessons reiterate and reteach our students the standard
s they must have to be successful.  The school 
has also invested in technology, hardware and software, to provide more individualized instruction for the student through 
the use of technology assisted instruction.  Hardware includes a second computer lab f
or the school, eleven mobile 
technology labs (either netbooks or Chromebooks), and Software which includes ST MIND math, Ticket to Read, and 
Renaissance Learning.  The classrooms are equipped with smart board technology and all grades have access to 
Chrome
books in carts to facilitate the use of technology in the classroom.  The school's GATE program is site based with 
differentiated instruction during the school day. The funds for GATE are used to provide GATE students with an enrichment 
after school progra
m.  The English Learner program is focused on improving students' acquisition of English language skills 
through a strong ELD program.
