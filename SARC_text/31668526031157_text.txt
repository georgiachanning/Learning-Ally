By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Newcastle Elementary School and District, located at the gateway to the foothills, first opened to 44 first through eighth
-
grade students in 1865. Although the building location has moved thr
ee times and enrollment for the elementary school 
has grown to over 400 students, it is still a small and close
-
knit community school.  The school serves transitional 
kindergarten through eighth
-
grade district and charter students.
 
 
Motto:
 
"Newcastle Knights 

 
Gems of the Foothills, Shining Above the Rest"
 
 
Vision:
 
Newcastle School is the cornerstone of a lifelong community of learners where students, staff, families, and community 
work together to ensure that students are successfully prepa
red for rigorous higher education coursework, career 
challenges, and a globally competitive workforce. Students are prepared to the highest level of social, moral, and academic 
development.
 
 
Mission:
 
The Newcastle Elementary School District is committed to
 
work in partnership with the home and community. Our 
students will be provided with an academic program designed to develop the 21st Century skills necessary to become 
active and effective global citizens. Our students will be supported in a safe, positiv
e learning environment that meets all 

 
 
Newcastle Elementary/Charter School enjoys the reputation of having a very strong academic and social program with 
capable, caring staff and administration. The school provides for academic achievement through a rigorous curricular 
program focused on the state standards enhanced with language study, the arts, and technology.  In the Newcastle school 
community, we belie
ve that every child can be successful, but not necessarily in the same way or on the same day.  We 
work together to create opportunities for success for all students.
 
 
Students receive differentiated instruction daily through flex time in core subjects. Ea
ch class has the benefit of an 
instructional assistant to support instruction and small groups during this time. All students in K
-
8 receive weekly 
instruction in Spanish, music, and physical education.  Students who qualify may participate in additional a
ctivities such 
as after
-
school sports, STEM classes, leadership, yearbook, history club, science/adventure club, and among others, 
Odyssey of the Mind. Newcastle Elementary/Charter School recognizes the social and academic value of a positive 
environment. 
A school
-
wide student recognition program honors exemplary student behavior and citizenship through the 
Stellar Knight program, Student of the Month, monthly character traits, and academic excellence.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Newcastle School works closely with Placer County Office of Education to maintain safe, clean and state
-
conforming 
facilities. The 
current school buildings were constructed in 1963 or more recently.  The school has recently undergone a 
three phase modernization project.  Property improvements in 2019 include remodeling the following:  building exteriors, 
new overhangs, new cement work
 
for walkways and planters, and the addition of an ADA ramp and new stairs.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Classrooms, restrooms, and the cafeteria are cleaned on a daily basis using the guidelines developed by the Placer County 
Office of Education and adopted by the 
governing board. A more thorough cleaning along with routine maintenance and 
repairs to buildings and grounds takes place during scheduled vacations and school breaks.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary t
o keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner.  A work order process is used to ensure that efficient service and highest priority are given 
to emergency repairs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Newcastle Elementary/Charter School is a focal point for students, their parents and community. Parents play important 
roles in the education of their children through active and ongoing involvement. Parent volunt
eers are welcomed on 
campus daily in roles such as reading group leaders, classroom helpers, safety supervisors, project coordinators, field trip 
supervisors, career presenters, athletic coaches, library volunteers, and Art, Music, and Garden Docents. Oppo
rtunities

safety inspections annually. Safety drills are held monthly and evacuation procedures are communicated to parents, The 
school staff explains policies about safety, behavio
r expectations, bullying and harassment annually to students and 
parents. Along with the annual February review and refinement of the Comprehensive Safety Plan, the Safe Schools Plan 
was also reviewed, refined and Board approved in Spring of 2018 by the Sc
hool Site Council and the Newcastle School
