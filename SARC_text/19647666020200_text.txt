responsibility of students, staff, parents, and community. Staff stresses personal integrity, social 
responsibility, and our national heritage.
 
 
Char

character education program that starts in Kindergarten and follows through to sixth grade. 
Monthly qualities are taught, rewarded, communicated to parents, and di
splayed on our marquee 
and monthly office bulletin board.

MISSION STATEMENT
 
Our mission is to encourage each child to develop individual excellence and a desire for lifelong learning so that they can
 
be contributing 
members of society. To accomplish this, we provide a positive, engaging, and challenging learning environment where all stude
nts are 
given equal access to the core curriculum.
 
 
We believe that each child is a unique learner and that childr
en thrive with personal recognition for academic progress and effort. With 
parents as partners, we have established a nurturing and supportive learning community, where staff work collaboratively and 
cohesively 
and share in the responsibility of assisting 
Olita students in demonstrating positive character traits, tolerance, social skills, effective 
communication, critical and creative thinking, problem solving, and decision making.
 
 

esponsible and productive citizen.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
co
ntains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which desc
ribes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information abo
ut SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF
 
web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Each year, the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) fills a 10
-
seat executive board with an accompanying support group that runs the committees. Parents 
work closely with the school to promote school spirit. The PTA condu
cts fundraisers, plans social events and assemblies, runs the Reflections Program, 
puts together a yearbook, organizes reading incentives, supports Red Ribbon Day, and conducts outreach programs. PTA has over
whelmingly supported 
the reading and math progra
m at Olita. Accelerated Reading was also purchased by the PTA to support the reading achievement of all students.
 
 
Parents attend Bingo Night, the Fall Fun Fair, various family nights, skate nights, picnics, and field trips. They are kept a
pprised of schoo
l events through 
the monthly voice mail, weekly mailings, School Messenger and a monthly newsletter posted on our school web site. Parents als

School Safety Pla
n
 
The learning environment reflects an academic focus and Olita
 
maintains high expectations and standards for student achievement and behavior. Pride 
in the physical environment is stressed, and a safe and orderly campus is maintained. Olita's school programs help to provide
 
a safe and appropriate 
learning environment
 
for all students.
 
 
There are multiple and diverse opportunities for students to be recognized for their achievements, good behavior, and citizen
ship. Monthly awards 
assemblies provide a time for the entire school to celebrate the accomplishments of the Ol
ita children. Student of the Month, Citizen of the Month, 
Reading and Math Clubs are just a few of the awards presented at the assembly.
 
 
A school
-
wide discipline program is in place.   Behavioral expectations are communicated to students, parents, and sup
port staff.  Guidelines for behavior 
are reviewed with all students, posted in each classroom, as well as sent home to parents. A student referral system is in pl
ace to ensure student behavior 
is monitored and is fair and consistent.  Students follow the d
istrict adopted dress code.
 
 
A comprehensive School Safety Plan has been developed where in case of disaster, all stakeholders know procedures and safety 
protocol expectations 
as explained in our National Incident Management System protocols   Drills for f
ire and earthquake evacuation procedures are practiced regularly.  Each 
classroom has a backpack filled with essential items needed in an emergency, such as attendance forms, accountability sheets,
 
band
-
aids, and basic first 
aid items.  A supply of water i
s on campus, and each student brings a bag of nonperishable food items to have in case of emergency.  These are stored in 
each classroom.  Staff has been assigned to teams of search and rescue, student release, first aid, and student supervision. 
 
We pract
ice a full walk
-
through drill each year where the school simulates disaster procedures.
 
 
Visitors on campus are expected to check in at the office with their ID ran through the Raptor system. All visitors and staff
 
wear an identification badge 
at all times
 
while on campus. Our campus is secured throughout the school day. The staff helps to make the procedure for dismissal and pic
k
-
up of 
students safe.

Professional Development 
provided for Teachers
 
 
Our teaching staff is continually seeking ways to improve their skills and the instructional program. Teacher training priori
ties are identified each year, 
and teachers and administrators participate in District and school
-
level inse
rvice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per 
week for site
-
based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after
-
school inservices, and various 
conferences throughout the 
year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout 
the year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted J
ourney
s from Houghton 
Mifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big 
Ideas for 6th grade. 
Textbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publish
er and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and 
Instruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct
 
Instruction (EDI) through 
DataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).
 
 
Olita is 
implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web
-
based reading program called 
Lexia.  Along with Lexia, we are using their Reading Plus program in grades three through six.
