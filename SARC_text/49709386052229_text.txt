Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
1. Classroom ceilings continue to be monitored for evidence of leaking. Tiles were replaced, and painted.
 
2. The raised beds in the school garden were inspected for damage and rot. Th
ey were reinforced and replaced as needed.
 
3. Ceiling leaks in one classroom in the main building continue to be problematic, although concerted efforts to find and 
repair the source of the leaks has greatly improved the problem and reduced the frequency o
f occurrence from "regular" 
to "intermittent."
 
 
The facility grounds needed general cleanup, mowing and maintenance after a warm summer season. General facility 
grounds maintenance was completed prior to the beginning of school.

Restructuring of the distri
ct's maintenance department has allowed for a facilities maintenance and repair plan to be 
developed and implemented. Several facilities walk
-
throughs by the maintenance team, and district and site 
administration provided the information needed to prioriti
ze the maintenance and repair projects, placing issues that 
impact health and safety at the top of the list. Close examination was given to the doors, walls, floors, ceilings, carpets, 
windows and working hardware. All areas of each classroom were inspecte
d, including the closets and storage areas, 
ceilings, vents and water fountains. We looked for evidence of leaks, discolored walls or ceiling tiles. Ventilation and 
heating filters were replaced. All the school bathrooms were inspected, examining the pipes
 
and hardware, walls, windows 
and floors. The tiled walls were sound, as were the partitions and plumbing. The school inspections included the Library, 
Multi
-
Purpose Room/cafeteria, and the storage sheds used to house playground equipment. All of the outsi
de facilities 
were inspected, including thee perimeter fences, gates and locks. In addition, each roof was inspected, swept clean of 
debris and accumulated branches and leaves, then checked closely for cracks and wear.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general ed
ucation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs
 
items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses tha
t satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

network of parent volunteers who assist teachers and staff both in and out of the classroom. Park Side holds many family 
events throughout th
e year, which encourage involvement including MakerSpace afternoon, Craft and Cocoa Book 


volunteers work tirelessly, raising funds to sponsor many activities and 
programs for Park Side School. The School Site Council provides ongoing support to Park Side by organizing family activities 
and fundraisers. Park Side always welcomes and appreciates
 
our community of parent volunteers. The ELAC (English 
Language Advisory Council), comprised of parents of students who are learning English as a second language, meet on a 
regular basis to discuss the needs and programs that serve English learners. Additi
onally, the council provides insight into 
the impact that linguistic and cultural differences may have on learning and creates opportunities for the entire school 
population to benefit from the riches that we may enjoy because we are fortunate enough to li
ve in a culturally diverse 
community.

Park Side offers student counseling and intervention services through its counseling staff, school psychologist, and 
Rainbow House. Academic intervention in reading for at
-
risk students is provided by a 
Reading Specialist. Through a 
generous donation from the Sebastopol Rotary Club, Learn with Me provides 1:1 support to students in need via trained 
volunteers.  The library at Park Side is an excellent resource for students to obtain reference materials fo
r class 
assignments as well as books for their reading enjoyment. Our school librarian ensures that the most current materials 
are available to our students. The Park Side School Garden provides opportunities for environmental education and to 
study the re
lationship between agriculture and community that distinguishes this area. The Garden Project was recently 
enhanced. Park Side School is also equipped with a regulation baseball field, which is also used after
-
 
school throughout 
the year by community sport
s organizations. A partnership between the Sonoma County Bicycle Coalition, the City of 
Sebastopol and the Sebastopol Union School District teaches students about bicycle and pedestrian safety, as well as the 
health benefits to individuals and to the envir
onment of walking or bicycling to school. Park Side Elementary School is very 
fortunate to be the recipient of additional educational funding through grants provided by SEF, (Sebastopol Education 
Foundation), Parcel Tax dollars, and Sebastopol Education Fo
undation (SEF) fundraising as well as ongoing donations from 
our community in support of our enrichment programs.

The primary focus for Professional Development over the past several years has been to hone our instructional practices 
by linking them to Common Core Standards
-
based on data results and the integration of instructional technology in the 
classroom.  Teache
rs continue to receive training in the development of our Response to Intervention Program, in the 
implementation of instructional strategies that effectively support English Learners, in analyzing student achievement 
data as a means of determining how bes
t to differentiate instruction and implementing common assessments for 
monitoring academic progress in English Language Arts and Math as well as the Common Core.
