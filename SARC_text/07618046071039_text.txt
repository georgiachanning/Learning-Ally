Principal's Message
 
Welcome to Walt Disney Elementary School! We are a Preschool through 5th Grade public 
elementary school in the San Ramon Valley Unified School District. We enjoy a 
true sense of a close 
knit community with our Disney families. On any given day you will find numerous parents on 
campus assisting teachers in classrooms, working with students, driving on field trips and 
facilitating various activities. The Disney staff a
ppreciates the close bonds we have with our diverse 
school community. Our high academic expectations have enabled us to consistently perform at high 
levels. At the same time, we recognize our students as individuals with a wide
-
range of talents, 
interests 
and skills. Creating a school climate which supports every child in reaching his or her 
potential is a top priority in making Walt Disney Elementary School a great place to learn and grow. 
Our school is excited to announce the launch of our Magnet program,
 
Walt Disney School of the 
Arts. Students participate in vocal music, instrumental music and performance arts classes as a way 
of learning through creativity.
 
 
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our principal, Kelly Walton, at 
kwa
lton2@srvusd.net.

include single family homes, apartments and condominiums. Stud

middle school at either Pine Valley or Iron Horse Middle School. We are part of the California High

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LC
FF) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data re
ported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF 
or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he dist
rict office.

education popula
tion and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
ali
gned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Staff and students 
take pride in keeping our campus safe, clean, and well
-
maintained. Visitors are required to check in at the office and wear identifying 
badges. Fire, safety, and earthquake drills take place on a monthly basis. Adults supervise the playground at all recess
es and at lunch time. In 2001, we 
established a Student Safety Patrol to assist with the safe loading and unloading of students from vehicles before and after 
school. Walt Disney has joined 
with our school district and community to participate in the Stree
t Smarts Safety Program. Our staff also provides yard supervision for fifteen minutes 
before and after school. We communicate regularly with our closest middle schools to address common student safety concerns.
 
 
Our safety plan was reviewed by both our Sch
ool Site Council and our staff in January of the 2019
-
20 school year.  We utilize the four District wide 
protocols for emergency communication.  Each staff member has a specific role in the case of an emergency as designated in ou
r site emergency plan.  
We
 
also use the data from the California Healthy Kids Survey (5th graders) and our District Climate Survey (4th/5th graders) to 
establish goals to increase 
connectedness and improve attendance.

The San Ramon 
Valley Unified School District (SRVUSD) practices a comprehensive, inclusive model of professional development for all staff.
 
Our high 
quality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy an
d instructional strategies. 
In 2012
-
13, we established district
-
wide K
-
12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional 
development offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University
 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math 
Initiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS an
d professional learning 
offerings.
 
 
These learning experie
nces are supported with on
-
site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches 
received certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one
-
to
-
one coaching, team 
and grade level 
coaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross
-
grade level, cross
-
discipline professional development sessions. These 
trainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, in
tentional instructional practices, formative assessment for 
learning, and lesson design.
 
 
In addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach
-
led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting. 
These co
horts are both semester
-
long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for 
Innovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.
 
 
We ensure that new teache
rs are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive 
trainings along with on
-
going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our
 
Framework 
for Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.

Under the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to d
eepen their content 
knowledge, 
strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. 
As a result, every 
staff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the di
strict as a whole is enhanced.
