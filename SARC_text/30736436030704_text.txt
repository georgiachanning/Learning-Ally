By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great effo
rts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are availa
ble at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet at 
https://tinyurl.com/TUSD

Facility
-
Inspection
-
Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a
 
timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Nelson School was built in 1965 with additional improvements made in subsequent years. District maintenance and 
grounds per
sonnel provide for the repair of the facilities and care of the school grounds. Recent projects include office 
bathroom remodel and addition of 14 dry
-
erase boards in our STEAM lab. The school has a state
-
approved asbestos 
abatement plan available for revi
ew in the school office. Nelson students, staff and parents are proud of their school and 
campus beautification efforts. A new rock and succulent garden is currently underway.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of 
Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathem
atics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] 
for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career
 
technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides inte
nsive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year. 
 
Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effect
ive instruction.
 
 
The SBAC targets for reading, writing, and math and current Running Record and ELPAC data are used to guide ongoing 
teachers professional development for Balanced Literacy to provide Common Core Standards implementation with 
technology.  
Both primary and upper
-
grade teachers receive 1:1 coaching led by master teachers from Momentum in 
Teaching.  Lab Days are provided three times during the school year. Nelson is a banking minutes school, so most 
professional development occurs on early rel
ease Wednesdays. Our MTSS teacher and paraprofessionals attend 
professional development led by a District TOSA which includes training in administering reading records and the 
implementation of Leveled Literacy Intervention kits. We have two new teachers r
eceiving support through a District 
induction process that includes guidance from a grade
-
level colleague. The school leadership team meets monthly to 
discuss school
-
wide timelines, data, and systems to support student learning. Teachers are supported duri
ng the 
implementation of instructional technology and Common Core Standards with ongoing collaboration, administrative 
guidance and resources. The primary focus areas include Mathematical Practices, Analyzing Data, Reading and Writing 
Workshop and Designat
ed ELD as determined by ELPAC data, running records and  SBAC performance indicators.
