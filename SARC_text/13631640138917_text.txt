About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a Scho
ol Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local C
ontrol 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data
 
reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LC
FF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
d
istrict office.

Imperial Unified School District held a public hearing  and determined that each school within the district had
 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the se
ttlement of Williams vs. The
 
State of California. Core subject textbooks and instructional materials are provided for each student, including English Lear
ners.
 
Standards
-
aligned texts and materials are reserved both for use in the classroom and to take hom
e. All textbooks and instructional
 
materials used within the school are aligned with California State Frameworks, State Board of Education, and District Standar
ds.
 
 
Imperial Unified School District is actively involved in the selection process of 
materials and textbooks. The selection process involves
 

option Cycle,
 
which requires every school site to review textbooks in each 
curriculum area within a seven
-
year cycle; textbooks are replaced at the
 
rate of one subject area per year. The table contains a list of the most recent textbook adoptions in core curriculum areas f
or the
 
school as of August 2019.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and
 
conduct 
inspections at school sites on a continual basis. Repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest prio
rity.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

 
The district 
governing board has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at 
the 
school office or at the district office. The site administration team works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleanin
g 
schedules to 
ensure a clean and safe school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 

 
The district does not participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program designed to assist school districts with 
expenditures for 
major repair or replacement of 
existing school building components. The program was eliminated in 2010
-
2011. The district does allocate 
funds to a Routine Restricted Maintenance account which is designed to fund district expenditures for major repair or replace
ment of exiting 
school bui
lding components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and 
floor 
systems.

Ben Hulse Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The majority of 
school facilities were built in 1954; 
the Roosevelt wing (the northern
-
most wing) was built in 1949. The school facilities are situated on 16 acres. The school buildings span 86,667 square 
feet consisting of 30 permanent classrooms and 25 portable classroo
ms which includes 1 intervention classroom, 7 Science Discovery rooms, and a 
meeting room for our parent/teacher organization. A library, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, an administrative office with a c
onference room and nurse's 
office, two staff work room
s and a Speech room are also part of the large school. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample
 
classroom and recreation space. The table shows the results of the most recent school facilities inspection.

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

We are excited to pr
omote our productive relationship with our dynamic and involved parental community. So many great aspects of our school rely 
on 
the continued support of our parents. There is no doubt Cross Elementary will thrive because of parental commitment and invol
vem
ent. A school is as 
strong as the partnerships between its community of parents, staff and students.  Cross will be a living proof of this!  Plea
se pursue whatever level of 
involvement you can; opportunities include, but are not limited to:
 
 
School Site Co
uncil (SSC)

-
wide volunteer
 
Parent/Teacher Association (PTO)
 
Parent Engagement Group (PEG)
 
English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 
District English Language Advisory Committee (DELAC)
 
School Safety Committee
 
 
Our school looks forward to 
working with staff and parents/guardians to develop meaningful opportunities for parents/guardians to be involved in district
 
and school activities; advisory, decision
-
making, and advocacy roles; and activities to support learning at home.
 
 
Cross PTO
-
 
Is c
urrently being established for 2020

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School 
Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Plan Revised September 06, 2019. Members of the school community met to develop the first School Safety Plan for
 
Cross Elementary. Input was received 
and documented on the plan.  The plan was approved by Imperial Unified School District for review on
 
September 12, 2019. A meeting for public input will be held on January 19, 2020. This document is available for publi
c inspection during regular business 
hours at Cross front office.
 
 
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the district to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and 
orderly learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their safe school plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine and emergency; policies relate
d to suspen
sion and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a school
-
wide dress code; safe ingress and egress of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
Emergenc
y Actions are a set of simple directives and alert level procedures that may be implemented across a number of emergency situ
ations.  When 
an emergency occurs, it is critical that staff members take immediate steps to protect themselves and others.  With E
mergency Actions in place, staff can 
follow specific directions without having to learn extensive protocols for each of several dozen different emergency situatio
ns.  The Incident Commander 
will decide which Emergency Actions to implement, based on the sit
uation.
 
 
The most common immediate emergency actions (Fire, Earthquake, Intruder/Lock Down) are reviewed and practice drills are imple
mented on a regular 
basis.  In addition, evacuation routes are practiced as well. Staff members must become familiar with 
each emergency action and be prepared to perform 
assigned responsibilities.  All students must be taught what to do when any of the common emergency actions are implemented.
 
 
Cross Elementary seeks the input of law enforcement, fire department, and our 
SRO to ensure efficient and effective safety measures are taken by staff.
