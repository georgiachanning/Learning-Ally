Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned
 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Alum Rock Union Elementary School District makes every effort to ensure all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To 
assist in this effort, the district uses the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) developed by the State of
 
California Office of Public 
School Construction. The results of this survey are available at the district office.
 
 
Cassell School was built in 1963. School facilities are renovated according to the Field Act requirements of the State 
Building Code with a 
focus on earthquake safety. In the event that asbestos and lead containing building materials are 
found, they are removed according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), State, and Local requirements. Deferred 
maintenance funds have been used to proper
ly maintain and renovate district buildings. Needed repairs and maintenance 
projects are completed in a timely manner.  Whenever possible, school facilities are upgraded to support and maintain a 
safe, clean and secure campus. Sufficient space for classroo
m, office, library, playground, staff room, and restroom 

School District maintenance staff, in conjunction with day and night custodians, 
ensure the school buildings and grounds 
are safe, clean, and in good repair. Rigorous daily custodial schedules ensure that classrooms, lavatories, serving kitchens,
 
eating areas, offices, and playgrounds are clean for both student and staff use.  Regular 
oversight by the district 

and play areas are safe for use.
 
 
All visitors are required to check
-
in at the school office. Fire drills and 
disaster procedures are specifically outlined and 
regularly updated and practiced. Safety programs include drug awareness, personal safety, and personal growth. To 
ensure a safe environment, the district provides extra yard duty supervisors, and all yard d
uty supervisors and school staff 
maintain a welcoming but controlled campus environment. The school grounds and playground are safe because they are 
well
-
supervised by staff before, during, and after school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Calif
ornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternat
e achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for e
ntrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cassell actively promotes
 
a strong, comprehensive parent involvement policy. Not only does Cassell promote two
-
way 

roles at the school. In addition to preparing pa
rents to actively participate in school decision making and developing their 
leadership skills in governance and advocacy, Cassell also provides parents with strategies and techniques to assist their 
children with learning activities at home. Our school ha
s a functioning School Site Council. Parents volunteer in a variety 
of ways from donating supplies, to tutoring and working with the teacher in the classrooms, and covering the playgrounds. 
Finally, to ensure that parents receive health, social, and other 
support services that are necessary to live healthy lives 
and promote student achievement, Cassell provides parents with the skills and resources to access community and 
support services. School Site Council /English Language Advisory Committee help make m
ajor decisions about the progress 
and focus of our school.
 
 

concerning the school. Parent training is provided by Cassell administration on topi
cs that address academic achievement 
and accountability. We schedule 'Family Nights' with Language Arts activities for families to engage in together. Parent 
workshops are provided for targeted students to help parents support learning in the home. Communi
ty agencies such as 
Alum Rock Counseling Center and Foothill Counseling Services provide counseling support to students and parents.  San 
Jose Police Department volunteer officers work with parents to resolve issues regarding attendance and proper 
supervis
ion, as well as provide special programs to support students.  Parenting classes are offered to parents along with 
comprehensive Resource Fairs both in the Fall and Spring.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Cassell Elementary School has in place a few precautions that we use to
 
help ensure the safety of our students. One of 
them is the prevention of strangers from infiltrating our campus. All visitors must sign in at the front desk; they are given
 
a badge to wear while on campus. Any one on campus without a badge is reported by 
staff and students. Gates on the 
side of the campus and on the front of the campus are locked 15 minutes after the start of school and before the end of 
school to make sure that strangers are not allowed to freely be on campus. Cassell has a very detailed,
 
comprehensive 
safety plan that outlines protocols, systems, and procedures in the event of any/all emergencies. The plan also contains 
the yearly safety goals as determined by the students, staff, and parents. The Safety Plan is developed by the Cassell S
afety 
Committee before it is presented to the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District Board of Trustees for approval. The 
Safety Plan and drill procedures are reviewed during the school year with all staff. Safety alerts are shared with all staff 
as 
nee
ded throughout the school year. In addition, all required drills are calendared and completed, and the results are 
shared with the staff. In October, the school participated in a district wide earthquake and evacuation drill. Both the staff
 
and students we
re fully prepared for a drill such as this. The Cassell Safety Plan has the following policies which are 
comprehensive, enforceable, and continuous:
 

 
Behavior Policy addressing Bullying Rules and Regulations
 

 
Dress Code Policy
 

 
Protocols for Safety/Emergency 
Drills Tardy Policy
