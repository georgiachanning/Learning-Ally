Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a d
ynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public 
libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hour
s of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Mark West Union School District (District) takes great efforts and care to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and 
functional. To 
assist in this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California OPSC. 
The results of this survey are available at the District Office.
 
 
 
The District uses a Maintenance work order tracking system 

items that require attention. The maintenance staff uses this system to ensure that the repairs necessary to keep the 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. Emerg
ency repairs and items that could have 
a negative effect on learning are given the highest priority.
 
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The District has established cleaning standards and cleaning rotation/Schedules for all schools in the District. A summary
 

ongoing with the custodial staff to ensure a clean and safe school.

through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to

The school's comprehensive safety plan is on file at the district office, the school site, and online at 
markwestcharter.org. 
It outlines procedures, following SEMS, for emergencies or natural disasters. The plan is reviewed and updated each year 
by staff and the SSC. Fire, earthquake, or lock
-
down drills are conducted monthly. Safety inspections are done rou
tinely 
by the maintenance department, especially prior to school opening.
 
 
The staff roles in case of an emergency are outlined in the comprehensive plan. A "flip
-
book" of emergency responses for 
various situations and drill procedures are kept in an obvio
us location in each classroom. Classrooms and all common 
areas (library, computer lab, for example) are equipped with a red emergency bag containing first aid supplies and a red 
bucket with emergency supplies.
 
 
To further ensure students' physical and psyc
hological safety, we implement structured peer conflict resolution to 
maintain a positive, safe environment and empower students to avoid and/or resolve conflicts successfully. Well trained 
adults supervise our teens at all times. Each student has an onlin
e document for MWCS Code of Conduct. This document 
includes expectations and consequences which are consistently and fairly employed by staff. Violations of expectations 
will be addressed in a positive, respectful, reasonable, and related manner. Keeping i
n mind that mistakes are 
opportunities to learn and grow , consequences will be issued on a severity continuum that can include conference with 
the teacher, phone call to parent, conflict mediation, behavior plan,  detention, loss of privileges, suspension
, or expulsion.

personnel throughout the district to plan together and attend workshops on best practices for 
standards based 
instruction. With the state adoption of the Common Core State Standards and a shift in assessment to a computer based 
assessment, the primary focus for staff development has been implementation of the Common Core State Standards. In 
support
 
of our English Language Learners, staff has received additional training in assisting EL's in meeting the CCSS. In 
alignment with our Strategic Plan, the district has provided support in the form of a Project Based Learning support teacher 
who goes into e
ach classroom coaching and supporting teachers in planning and implementing project based learning in 
the classroom. All staff are receiving training and support in the area of Social Emotional Well
-
being through our Director 
of Student Services and Counse
lor. The district relies heavily on the support of the County Office of Education, which 
provides a wide range of professional development opportunities in implementation of CCSS and Next Generation Science 
Standards (NGSS). We utilize early release days, 
known as "site days" and "district days" as well as faculty meetings to 
provide training for staff. All new teachers participate in the North Coast Teacher Induction Program through Sonoma 
County Office of Education during their first two years of teaching
. These classes are held after school hours and each new 
teacher is assigned an experienced mentor for the entire process. More experienced teachers participate in training 
according to their needs and interests.
