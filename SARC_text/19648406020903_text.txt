School Description
 
California Distinguished Elementary School and Three Time Winner of California Business for 
Education Excellence Award. The California School Recognition Program identifies and honors the 

nia Distinguished School Award.  
The award is highly sought after by schools in all areas of the State.  We are very proud of this 
award, which recognizes our efforts to close the academic achievement gap and our strong 
commitment to two complementary sign
ature practices: balanced approach to reading instruction 
and systematic English Language Development program.  These two practices are designed to 
increase listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills through high level questioning and active 
student 
engagement.  Standard based instruction is organized to include whole group modeling, 
small group guided practice, individualized conferring, and academic discourse.  All students have 
daily access to technology and other high interest instructional level 
materials and resources and 
are given several project
-
based experiences throughout the instructional year.
 
 
With the support of our PTA, Eastwood students have many opportunities to express themselves 
creatively as they are exposed to the visual and perfor
ming arts standards. All students participate 
in the Meet the Masters visual arts program, and they take field trips to the Cerritos Performing 
Arts Center and the La Mirada Civic Theater. In addition to our visual arts programs, we have added 
instrumental
 
music instruction to our K
-
5 visual and performing arts curriculum, which includes a 
drum room filled with a variety of drums and percussion instruments. Our fifth grade students 
experience our long tradition of African drums and dance unit of study along
 
with four days of 
science camp. We have a well
-
organized, hands
-
on science curriculum that is enriched by 
assemblies, field trips, in
-
school gardening, and family STEAM nights. All parents are highly 
encouraged to attend all of our Common Core Math Parent
 
Education Nights. We are proud of our 
"We Care Wednesday" program. Each month students, staff, and families support a local, national, 
or global charity through donations of change or items.  Donations include can goods, toys, and 
friendly notes for Meals
 
on Wheels.
 
 
We are fully Implementing Common Core State Standards in math, reading, and writing. You will 
see technology, math walls, classroom libraries, whole group, small group, academic discourse and 
differentiation in every classroom. You will notice
 

will hear students in deep conversations as they make meaning of stories and text of varying genres. 
We are strengthening our writing program for all grades by increasing daily writing opportunities, 
and teac
hing to a school wide curriculum. Students are routinely engaged in problem solving 
activities and are encouraged to explain their thinking using pictures, diagrams, number sentences, 
and in writing.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page 
at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information 
about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the 
county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides r
eports 
for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English 
learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are 
publ
icly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet 
at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first

come, first
-
served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, 
the length of time that a w
orkstation may be used (depending on 
availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, 
and the ability to print documents.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents are an integral part of the school decision making process and student support system. Elected parents sever on the  
School Site Council  and 
English Language Advisory Committee. Both have the responsibility o
f identifying and prioritizing school needs and insuring that the school plan reflects 
the identified needs the school.
 
 
Volunteers working in the classrooms, the computer lab and library, as well as coordinating PTA and classroom events log coun
tless numb
er of hours. 
Our wonderful PTA plays a vital part in organizing parent volunteers to help with special classroom projects, field trips, an
d school wide events. The PTA 
supports the instructional program by sponsoring field trips, assemblies, art programs, 
after school classes, Family STEAM Nights, Red Ribbon Week, 
annual spring luau, and our Read Across America celebration.  Our PTA plans a very successful College Week. The goals of this
 
weeklong event are for 
students to understand how significant learning
 
is beyond high school provide parents with information on college planning, and most importantly, for 
each Eastwood student to feel that they are college bound.

State Priority: School Climate
 
T
he SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The school has a Positive Supp
ort Intervention Plan (PBIS) that clearly articulates student behavior expectations, character traits development, and school
 
wide recognition program.  Teachers teach to the behavior expectations of Be Safe, Be Responsible, and Be Respectful. A chara
cter 
trait is highlighted 
each month. Students are recognized for behavior, school and community spirit, and academic accomplishments in a variety of w
ays. Students have 
many opportunities to earn Golden Eagle Tickets for demonstrating positive character traits
 
and for following the school rules. Monthly Student of the 
Month awards and trimester awards are given in recognition of positive behavior and meeting attendance and academic expectati
ons.
 
 
We revise our School Safety Plan annually during the month of Jan
uary.  The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit routes, and inventories of 
emergency supplies. We make the plan available on our school Web site and keep copies in the office for parents. We share the
 
plan with all staff during 
a school wide staf
f meeting. We practice monthly fire drills and earthquake drills monthly and lockdown drills three times a year.
