Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Our School is named for Leo B. Hart, a pioneer in the field of education in Kern County and a former Shafter resident. Mr. 
Hart was the founder of Arvin Federal Emergenc
y School and is considered one of the greatest  humanitarians of his time.  
He is best known for the emergency schoolrooms he built for immigrants during the 1930s.  Leo B. Hart Elementary School 
is located at 9501 Ridge Oak Drive in southwest Bakersfield.
  
Since its opening in 1988, Hart School has enjoyed strong 
parent and  community support.
 
 
At Leo B. Hart Elementary School, "We will engage and support all students in the journey of becoming lifelong learners."  
Furthermore, this year's vision is that "
Each student will progress emotionally, socially, and/or academically this year."

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Hart provides a safe and clean environment for 
learning. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the District 
to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy that provides for good learning. 
Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed Ca

Coordinator of Safety and Risk Management verifies quarterly that OSHA requirements are met. The exterior grounds are 
well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for student protection and 
safety. A team of custodians ensures 
classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and secured at the end of 
each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. As outlined in our Safe Schools Plan
, the safety committee 
has addressed concerns for the safe coming and going of our students. The committee feels that security of all students is 
of the highest priority.  Staff receives in
-
service in emergency protocol and CPR. All district employees, inc
luding 
substitutes, must wear identification badges while on our site or any district site.  Visitor stickers via Raptor are issued 
to 
parents entering our campus, volunteers, and other visitors as they register in our office. The gates on the perimeter of
 
the school playground are locked during school hours and staff members are trained to activate lock down procedures in 
the event of an emergency. Our positive partnership with local law enforcement is evident in their quick response time 
when concerns ari
se. Designated staff members carefully supervise students on the playground and in the cafeteria. 
Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly for potential hazards. The District provides on
-
going training 
in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff 
development program. Fire, Lockout, Lockdown, and/or disaster drills occur regularly 
and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and available for public review. Scheduled 
certificated supervision of students begins officiall

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.
