WHF Vision Statement: William H. Frazier students will 
be actively engaged, challenged, and 
motivated to take ownership of their own learning that will prepare them for college and career 
readiness.
 
 
Our schoolwide goals are:
 
1. All students will meet their individual ELA goal by May 2020.
 
2. All 
students will meet their individual Math goal by May 2020.
 
 
These goals are evident around our campus, in our classrooms, and in each student's Leadership 
Notebook where students (along with their teachers) track their academic and personal goals.
 
 
At Will
iam H. Frazier...  We work hard.  We do our best.  We are leaders!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which in
cludes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven
. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilit
ies); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the 
standard (i.e., achieved Level 3

Opportunities for Parental
 
Involvement (School Year 2019
-

William H. Frazier School is committed to working with our parents to extend and enrich the school experience for all student
s. We believe in providing 
parents and families with regular communication through our school we
bsite, Peachjar flyers, "all calls," social media feeds, and our weekly 
communication folders. Opportunities for parents to engage in the school are outlined annually in our Parent and Family Engag
ement Plan. We welcome 
parents on our campus and annually o
ffer a "Meet and Greet" before school begins, a Fall "Back To School Night," student
-
led parent conferences, Coffee 
and Conversation with the Principal, a "Leadership Day," Family STEM events, and a Spring "Open House." We offer a variety of
 
parent volunte
er, 
education, and engagement opportunities at our site. We encourage parents and community members to join the Parent Teacher As
sociation (PTA), and 
to participate by attending various school committee meetings such as School Site Council (SSC), English L
earner Advisory Committee (ELAC) and 
Lighthouse Leadership Meetings. For more information regarding parent involvement opportunities please see the school site Pa
rent and Family 
Engagement Plan, contact the site administration or your child's teacher.

State Priority: School Clim
ate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Each Fallbrook Union Elem
entary School District site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness plan 
annually. School administrators work closely with local law enforcement, fire department and/or the Provost Marshall's Office
 
on Camp Pe
ndleton who 
review the plans and also participate in emergency drills, provide feedback, attend site and district safety meetings and col
laboratively help to improve 
overall campus safety, climate, and security.  Copies of the Comprehensive School Safety P
lans are available for review at each school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for school safety, natural disasters, and campus intruders. It also contains appropriate strate
gies and programs that will 
provide or maintain a high level of schoo

teachers, and staff are trained to prepare for a wide range of emergency situations, and frequent drills help to refine emerg
ency skills, poli
cies, and 
procedures at all school sites. Following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to co
ntinually improve emergency 
procedures, and improve campus safety.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediate
ly investigate threats of harm. Teachers and administrators seek to foster lines of open 
communication so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity including bullying, harassment, or th
reats. All FUESD staff take 
a strong stand
 
against threatening behavior or bullying and investigate complaint matters fully. Many positive programs exist districtwide t
o enhance 
and continually improve school culture and climate, including Positive Behavior Intervention and Support, Restorative Pr
actices, Suicide Prevention, Anti
-
Vaping Education and Trauma
-
Informed Practices.
