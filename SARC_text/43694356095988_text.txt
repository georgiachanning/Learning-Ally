About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
information about 
the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educ
ational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Evergreen School District held a Public Hearing on October 10, 2010, and determined that each school
 
within the district has sufficient and good quality 
textbooks and instructional materials pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California.
 
 
All students, including English Learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textb
ooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects 
for use in the classroom and to take home. All textbooks and instructional materials used within the district must be aligned
 
with the California State 
Content Standards, with final approval by the
 
Board of Trustees. Textbooks and supplementary materials are typically adopted according to a cycle 
developed by the California Department of Education. The table displays information collected in September 2018 about the qua
lity, currency, and 
availabili
ty of the standards
-
aligned textbooks and other instructional materials used at the school. The district does not have a formal textbook adoption
 
for Health or for Visual and Performing Arts.
 
 
The California State Board of Education adopted science 
programs at its November 2018 public meeting.  Evergreen will review materials in 2019
-
20 to 
determine next steps.  The California State Board of Education adopted Social Science materials at its November 2017 public m
eeting aligned to the new 
California F
ramework.  The California Social Science standards remain unchanged.
 
 
Pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 60210, a school district may utilize instructional materials not adopted b
y the SBE, so long as the 
materials are aligned to state stan
dards and a majority of the participants of any review process conducted by the district are classroom teachers who 
are assigned to the subject area or grade level of the materials being reviewed.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Montgomery Elementary School, originally constructed in 1975, is currently comprised of 29 permanent classrooms, a Special Da
y Class pre
-
school 
portable, an adult English Language Development (ELD) por
table, a computer lab, a library, a cafeteria/multipurpose room, a staff lounge, and two 
playgrounds. Over the past few years, a new two
-
story classroom building has been constructed, the front office was thoroughly renovated, and teaching 
walls were added
 
to the primary building. Additionally, the district passed a facilities bond measure in 2006 that will allow for future moder
nization. The 
chart displays the results of the most recent facilities inspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process:
 
Montgomery Elementary School
 
provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The district has adopted cleaning standards 
for all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emp
hasis on cl
assrooms and 
restrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter
-

staff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning en
vironment.
 
 
Maintenance & Repair:
 

avy maintenance 
functions occurring during vacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenanc
e program is administered by Evergreen School District to ensure that 
school grounds and facilities remain in excellent repair. A work order process is used when issues arise that require immedia
te attention. Emergency 
repairs are given the highest priorit
y; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which they are received.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The State School Deferred Maintenance Program provides state matching funds on a dollar
-
for
-
dollar basis, to assist school districts wit
h expenditures 
for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, 
air conditioning, electrical 
systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. In the Budget Act of July 20
09, the State Legislature provided school districts with flexibility in 
using these funds to meet general fund needs. In an effort to mitigate the effects of declining state revenues, the Evergreen
 
School District has taken 
advantage of this flexibility. T
he district will utilize bond funds and other appropriate sources to ensure its facilities are clean, safe and in good repair
.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
S
marter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligi
ble students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Level 3

Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both as
sessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (

accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The number of students t

the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calc
ulated using only students who received scores.

Staff members build teaching skills and concepts through participation in conferences, workshops, faculty meetings, professio
nal development 
opportunities and teacher collaboration throughout the year. Targeted Professional Development and Grade level coll
aboration are strategies that most 
impact instruction and supports the training that teachers receive. Data is analyzed to help determine "next steps." Evergree
n School District provides 
many professional development opportunities for Montgomery staff such
 
as training in Professional Learning Communities, Equity PLC Forum, Tech 
Tuesdays, The Learning Cafe, annual 21st Century Conference and a variety of trainings throughout the summer. Our district of
fice in conjunction with 
school principals and instructio
nal coaches are currently in the third phase of implementation of our Profile of a Learner to ensure teaching and student 
learning reflects the skills of a 21st Century learner. SEAL (Sobrato Early Academic Language) is a strong focus in the prima
ry grades
. Teachers receive 
intense professional development in teams throughout the early and can also participate in the Summer Bridge training. 
 
 
Staff development at John J. Montgomery is directly aligned to the skills and concepts in the district's Profile of 
Learner. To ensure rigor is present in 
teaching and learning, and to better prepare students from grade to grade, we focus closely on Common Core State Standards. A
fter closely reviewing 
the needs or our community and students, the school leadership has ag
reed to the following professional development:
 

 
Opportunities to unpack the details of Profile of a Learner Outcomes and learn the teaching and learning shifts that are need
ed for 21st 
Century teaching and learning
 

 
Design lessons and activities for the gra
de level unit guides
 

 
Unpack standards to create Learning Targets and Success Criteria and scoring rubrics
