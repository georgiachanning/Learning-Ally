By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-

Welcome to Howard School! I am very proud to be the principal of
 
Howard Elementary School, which serves 582 preschool 
through sixth grade students. Howard is a special place where high expectations and an emphasis on effort and hard work 
pay off in high student achievement. Our staff is dedicated to the success of each
 
child and is relentless in doing whatever 
it takes to help our students to be successful in school and in life. We are the proud recipient of the Title One Academic 
Achievement Award, California Distriguished School, as well as earning the honor as a Gold
 
Ribbon School. Additionally, 
we have been awarded the California Business for Education Excellence Award for two consecutive years. During the 2019
-
2020 school year, Howard earned the Gold PBIS Implementation Award.  The fundamental purpose of PBIS is to 
establish 
clear school wide expectations with incentives and consequences, teach our students the Positive Behavior Expectations, 
and create a recognition system for students doing the right thing. At Howard, our Behavior Expectations are Respect, 
Responsi
bility, Kindness, and Integrity.
 
 
Howard is a safe and caring setting for student learning. We take time to get to know our kids well and offer a variety of 
extra
-
curricular activities to help children to engage in school. Some of these activities include 
noon
-
time soccer, 
volleyball, basketball, Reindeer Run Practice, choir, fitness club, instrumental music, spelling bee, Crazy Contraption, 
poetry day, Science Fair, and Math Pentathlon. Evening events, designed to bring our families to school for fun, are 
offered 
each trimester. These include: Movie Night, McTeacher Night and Sports Night.
 
 
We know that students achieve better when they are on time to school every day and our attendance rate is high.  We 
work as a community to stress the importance of atten
dance and provide assistance, when needed, to make sure families 
and students feel supported on attendance.
 
 
Working with families to support students is a major emphasis in our school and parents are asked to take an active role 

. We are proud of our 100% attendance at Parent
-
Teacher conferences and know that this home
-
school connection is critical to our success.
 
 
Howard School, located in the southern portion of the City of Montclair, is one of thirty
-

overall and in Math 9% overall, at or above mastery. In ELA, 54% of students are performing at or above mastery. In Math, 
46% of stu

quality educatio
n focusing on academics and preparing them for an ever

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
