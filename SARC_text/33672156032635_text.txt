Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Site Council or the Site Safety Committee is responsible for the development and updating of the school's 
Comprehensive Safety Plan. A Site Comprehensive Safety Plan Checklist is provided by the Pupil Services Department to 
give guidance on what
 
should be included in the School's Safety Plan. The Safety Plan is discussed with staff, evaluated, 
amended/reviewed/updated by January 31 of each year. The school's safety committee makes monthly safety inspections 
and holds monthly safety committee meet
ings. A school Disaster Preparedness Plan that deals with a wide variety of 
emergency situations is incorporated into the School Safety Plan.  Earthquakes, fire, lock down, and active 
shooter/intruder drills are conducted as required. The key elements of t
he Comprehensive School Safety Plan include an 
assessment of current status of school crime; provisions of any school
-
wide dress code including the definition of "gang 
related apparel"; safe movement of pupils, parents and school employees to and from scho
ol; strategies in maintaining a 
safe and orderly school environment; visitors on campus; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, routine 
and emergency; policies related to suspensions, expulsion or mandatory expulsion and other school design
ated serious 
acts which would lead to suspension or expulsion, notification to teachers, anti
-
bullying policy, discrimination/harassment, 
and school discipline rules and procedures pursuant to EC 35291 and EC 35291.5. The school also has an assigned School
 
Resource Officer (SRO).

At Highland, we understand that in order to adapt to the changing needs of 
21st century learning, we must always be 
learners.
 
Areas of focus for professional development are primarily selected based on student achievement data retrieved form a 
variety of sources  (SBAC, DIBELS, District Assessment, ELPAC).    District
-
wide adopti
on of new curriculum and/or new 
assessments have also resulted in the need for specific professional development to support implementation in the 
classroom. Additionally, Highland's staff and teachers request professional development that will help them im
prove their 
methodology in literacy, numeracy and/or language development.  Staff and teachers have also expressed the need for 
professional development to learn more about approaches to deal with socio
-
emotional issues in their classrooms. 
Depending on th
e grade level, subject or school focus, all teachers participated in 3 

 
10 days of professional development.
 
 
Professional development is delivered through various methods, such as full
-
day trainings, after
-
school workshops, and 
conference attendance. Dep
ending on the scope and topic of the professional development, teachers and staff are 
supported through the implementation in a variety of ways. For district offered professional development training, 
teachers often receive follow
-
up coaching and teacher
-
p
rincipal meeting support.  Other professional development is 
followed up in grade
-
level team and site leadership team meetings.
 
 
Highland teachers and staff participate in a variety of staff development opportunities during the school year including 
the fo
llowing:
