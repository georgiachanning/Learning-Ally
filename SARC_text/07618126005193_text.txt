By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 

 
 
Parkmead Elementary School, located in Walnut Cr
eek, first opened its doors in 1948 in an area where agriculture was 
moving out to make room for suburban development. It is now a quick 10
-
minute walk from a bustling downtown that 
has grown into a culturally rich hub of the San Francisco East Bay region.
 


g 
arts center, all of which the school extensively uses. In 1985, the governing boar
d chose to close the school due to low 
attendance. Parkmead was reopened in 1989 with 324 students. In the years since it reopened, Parkmead School has 
expanded to its current enrollment of 442 TK
-
5 students. The sprawling campus contains four wings of cla
ssrooms, an 
administrative wing, and an active child
-
care center. The campus also includes play structures and 4 acres of lawn and 
fields that are utilized, not only by the students during school hours, but also by organized youth sports teams and 
neighbor
hood families during non
-
school hours. This year our focus is on the workshop model of instruction in reading, 
writing, and mathematics. Walnut Creek School District adopted the reading workshop program in the spring of 2018. 

th these new tools and increase student engagement, inspiration, and empowerment. Our 
site focus is building a reading life thereby increasing the amount of reading students will accomplish as well as deepen 
students' understanding of the different genres 
of texts. We believe as students increase reading volume and develop an 
understanding of the complex text they will
 

 
Become critical thinkers
 

 
Build independence in all areas, and
 

 
Improve collaborative skills
 
The Parkmead staff believes that our work with st
udents will produce citizens who are able to work with others 
respectfully in order to solve real
-
world problems and make society better.
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
 
The mission of the Parkmead Elementary School and community is to equip our 
children to succeed in an ever
-
changing 
world, by fostering a learning environment that promotes discovery, innovation, creativity, leadership, and character. 

lowing three strategies 
that guide our school site plan:
 
 
Strategy 1: We will meet the needs of all students by implementing a differentiated and challenging academic program in 
which inquiry, discovery, creativity and collaboration are fundamental while d
eveloping enthusiastic, lifelong learners.
 
 
Strategy 2: The Parkmead School Community will understand Parkmead Strategic Plan and school guidelines through 
consistent, clear and streamlined communications. The Parkmead School community will be an active an
d passionate 
partner in the development of new and improved communications processes.
 
 
Strategy 3: We will provide a safe, non
-
threatening environment in which the Parkmead community respects diversity and 
demonstrates positive, intrinsic lifelong values.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Year and month in which data were collected:
 
September 23, 
2019
 
 
The state of California requires that each child have a current standards
-
based textbook in each of the four core areas of 
instruction. As a part of this requirement, Walnut Creek School District has purchased editions for teaching language arts 
(rea
ding, writing, speaking and listening), science, social science, mathematics and health. We are fortunate to have a 
music text (K
-
5) for our students and a music specialist who meets with all of the classes. Our foreign
-
language texts are 
also up
-
to
-
date. 
Thus, all textbooks in the Walnut Creek School District are current, standards
-
based, and consistent with 
the content and cycles of the Curriculum Frameworks and adopted and approved by the State Board of Education.
 
 
We have an abundance of supplementary r
eading materials at varying levels of difficulty in each of our elementary 
classrooms that are integrated across all core curricular areas. These leveled reading materials provide students with 
experiences in reading narrative as well as expository text.
 
 
The Walnut Creek School District governing board held a public hearing on September 23, 2019 and affirmed that each 
pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
School Facilities
 
The Parkmead school site is a source of pride in the community. Renovated in 2000, the facility is safe, structurally sound 
and well maintained. The buildings are designed to support student learning as w
ell as the many community events held 
on the campus. The Parkmead School facility supports many types of student learning in a variety of instructional spaces: 
21 classrooms; a library media center; art, music and science rooms; a resource room; and a larg
e multipurpose room. 
Outdoor learning areas and a school garden provide attractive places for students and staff to take educational 
opportunities outdoors or for parent and community groups to gather. Even in times of significant budget constraints, 
maint
enance and repair of facilities are a top priority in the district.
 
 
Students work and learn in well
-
lit, heated and cooled classrooms and specialty rooms (art, music, resource and science). 
Every classroom has a telephone with access to an outside line, i
nternet access, a computer, a document camera, and LCD 
projector or TV Monitor. Furnishings are in good repair and of appropriate size for the students who use them.
 
 
The classrooms, common areas, and grounds are kept clean and in excellent repair by site 
custodial and district 
maintenance staff. All toilets are in good repair and cleaned daily by two full
-
time equivalent (FTE) custodians. The 
custodial staff is on duty from early morning to night with a custodian cleaning classrooms every other day after s
tudents 
leave. At least one custodian is on campus for the many evening activities on
-
site.

events. Our library is large and adequate for our st
udent population. District funds, augmented with parent funds, provide 
enough time for our library media specialist to keep our spacious library

with its large and current collection of books

open during school and for 30 minutes after school hours.
 
 
Durin
g the summer of 2005, improvements were made to the entrance to the site used by kindergarten and our after
-
school day
-
care program. Traffic flows more safely and students move around that part of the facility on clearly defined 
pathways.
 
 
In terms of supe
rvision, staff is on duty before and after school to ensure student safety. During the school day, classified 
and certificated staff members supervise all common areas at recess and lunch. Because Parkmead is such a busy school 
with many parent and communi
ty members volunteering every day, we have a well
-
defined and carefully implemented 
sign
-
in and badge system, with all volunteers signing in and out and wearing nametags.
 
 
Parkmead renovated its fields and playgrounds during the summer of 2010 using Measur
e C bond funds passed by the 
voters in 2005. The funds upgraded our fields, enhanced all play areas and addressed drainage issues. In 2011, we totally 
renovated our kitchen.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics gi
ven in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
stud
ents with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technic
al education sequences or programs 
of study.

role focuses on the development, implementation, and evaluation of curricular progra
ms. The School Improvement 
Program provides Parkmead with $53,875 per year.  The SSC oversees these funds and allocates them to support the 
implementation of the site action plans for school improvement.
 
 
Parkmead has an active Parent Teacher Organization (
PTO), with membership including both parents and staff who play 
a major role in site
-
based decision
-
making. The parent groups and the Parkmead Education Resources Council work 
together to help support the school
-
wide character
-
education programs, technolog
y, enrichment, science lab supplies, 
and a STREAM Lab open during lunch recess to name a few. The parent groups also support Parkmead Enrichment Program 
(PEP). This unique school culture has led to a dynamic School Plan, guided by our active School Site Co
uncil. Our plan 
supports a curriculum that meets or exceeds state benchmarks with a commitment to high
-
quality, proven practices and 
systematically addresses areas of improvement. The collaborative, multistep planning process has added to the synergy 
that 
characterizes this school community.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our school safety plan is current and detailed. It was reviewed, updated and discussed with school faculty in August 2019.
 
We hold monthly drills and review safety procedures with students and staff on a regular b
asis. We update the plan 
annually with input from staff and parents. A school
-
wide Twitter account is in place to contact parents. A detailed 
earthquake
-
preparedness plan outlines the duties of all staff in the event of an earthquake and contains a complet
e list 
of the emergency supplies stored in two shipping containers. A local community group, a trained Community Emergency 
Response Team (CERT), collaborates with us on emergency preparedness. Parents receive regular information and 
reminders about our eme
rgency procedures in the weekly e
-
bulletin, district App, and Blackboard Communication HQ 
communiques.
 
The Parkmead Safety Committee monitors the school safety plan and maintains supplies and equipment on a regular basis.

All professional growth is determined by both school site and district strategic planning process, which is ongoing 
throughout the school year and culminates with an update in the spring of each year. Planning 
teams include all school 
and community stakeholders, and the work is based on site
-
needs assessments. Input from all school and community 
stakeholders is collected during the planning process and is used to develop the district Local Control and Accountabi
lity 
Plan (LCAP).
 
 
For 2019
-
2020, the district focus will be on the implementation of the recently adopted math programs at both the K
-
5 
and 6
-

i
dentifying the implementation of Common Core State Standards for professional growth in the district LCAP, other areas 
for professional development identified in the district LCAP are: Technology Integration, English Language Development 
(ELD) instructiona
l strategies and Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative (SVMI) training.
 
 

identifies goals for supporting the district focus, staff members m
eet by grade level or departments to study student 
assessment data or student behaviors and determine how to improve instruction through research and effective 
pedagogy. Weekly collaboration time is provided for all TK
-
8 teachers. Instructional coaches pro
vide individual student
-
centered coaching cycles and participate in grade
-
level and department meetings to support professional growth.
 
 
Individual teachers and administrators keep their skills current by researching about learning, attending workshops and
 
classes and reading on their own. Some examples are attendance at various conferences: Teachers College Reading and 
Writing Project, ISTE, PBL World, SVMI, Middle School Conference, Socratic Seminar, Reading Recovery, and technology. 
Teachers attend train
ing sessions in differentiated instruction, special education, Next Generation Science Standards 
(NGSS) and in all core curricular areas. Beginning teachers participate in a two
-
year induction program with a mentor who 
is trained through the Contra Costa C
ounty Office of Education Teacher Induction Program.
 
 
We continue to provide four days each school year that are dedicated to staff and professional development. The district 
ensures the agendas for these professional growth days are tied to areas defined 
by the strategic plan and LCAP.
