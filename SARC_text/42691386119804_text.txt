Description
 
We are proud of our CAASPP achievement, exceeding overall state averages in English Language 
Arts and Math. We are a school of continuous improvement in teaching and learning. You will find 
this information and more within this SARC (School Acc
ountability Report Card). The Oak Valley 
SARC is designed to provide annual information to the community, parents, and staff on topics 
specified by the California Department of Education. This document is one measure of school 
accountability. Along with th
e School Accountability Report Card (SARC), the district's Local Control 
Accountability Plan (LCAP) and the Oak Valley 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA) all 

ns for 
students and staff. These collective plans articulate the path forward to meeting those expectations 
at our school. These Accountability Plans and additional information can be found on our website 
(http://oakvalleyelem.org/) or in the front office 
of our school. 
 
 
At the beginning of each school year, administrators and staff within Buellton Union School District 
reflect on our body of work and student achievement. We establish goals and objectives to meet 
and exceed students' needs. Each year we 
review our programs and implementation to increase 
the academic and social
-
emotional success of our students and staff. This analysis is based on 
formative and summative assessment data and multiple measures. For this 2019
-
20 school year, 
we are building o
n our strengths and strategically addressing our identified needs. Our required 
educational plan goals are in concert: Local Control Accountability Plan, 
School Plan
 
for Student 
Achievement, and Buellton School District Common Core Implementation Plan.
 
 
Ou
r school goals are:
 
1.
 
Enhance the school wide use of effective research
-
based programs and materials so that 
100% of our students receive CCSS standards
-
based instruction in ELA and Math (LCAP #2)
 
2.
 
Refine our comprehensive Response to Intervention (
RTI) processes and programs so that 
all students show growth on site
-
based and CCSS interim assessments by trimester and 
our subgroups show significant growth in proficiency in ELA and Math from August to the 
end of the instructional year in May, as measur
ed by growth targets as established by 
CAASPP outcomes and State recommendations. 
 
3.
 
All EL students will receive the appropriate level of ELD instruction daily with research
-
based programs and strategies. EL students will demonstrate progress on ADEPT 
-
 
A 
Developmental English Proficiency Test and on the English Language Proficiency 
Assessment for California (ELPAC) with a minimum of one year's growth for one year's 
time. 
 
4.
 
All students will receive the appropriate level of technology instruction dail
y with 
research
-
based programs and strategies based on the district technology standards. All 
staff will receive appropriate professional development in order to utilize technology to 
support teaching and learning. (LCAP #3)
 
5.
 
The school will foster a sc
hool climate of safety, engagement and school connectedness 
for students staff, families and community.(LCAP #4)
 
6.
 
Provide staff with tools to provide social, emotional and behavioral support for students 
(MTSS). (LCAP #4)
 
7.
 
Create a school
-
wide STEAM 
lab in order to bring science, technology, engineering, arts 
and math alive outside of the classroom.

Our Mission ~ To e
nsure optimal conditions for students to become academically proficient, socially balanced, and responsible young 
citizens. These conditions are defined as follows:
 

 
A strong and appropriate learning environment reflecting high expectations within a 
standards
-
based curriculum.
 

 
A program by which instructional decisions are based on student performance.
 

 
A school atmosphere that reflects safety, responsibility, respect, kindness and recognition.
 

 
A commitment to expanding our resources and opportunities 
in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SA
RC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (L
CAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more
 
information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Oak Valley Elementary. The school complies with all laws, rules, and
 
regulations pertaining to 
hazardous materials and state earthquake s

a disaster. Fire, disaster, earthquake and lockdown drills are conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year. Our a
nnual district
-
wide d
isaster 
drill simulation helps our safety teams stay current with best practice. Additionally, lead teachers are CPI
-
trained in Crisis Prevention and Intervention. 
We also use Parent Square for school and district
-
wide emergency communications.
 
 
To ensure 
student safety, teachers and instructional aides supervise students at all times before, during, and after school. Our full
-
time district counselor 
provides social
-
emotional support for students as needed. All visitors are required to check in at the schoo
l office upon arrival, submit their drivers license 

he office upon leaving. 
Parents and community are updated every fall as to the 
secure campus procedures, including locked gates during school hours, and direct drop
-
off and 
pick
-
up with students K
-
3.  The separate Kindergarten entrance and play area provides greater security.
 
 
The Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the school
 
in consultation with local law enforcement in order to comply with Senate Bill 187 of 1997. 
The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning environment. Components of the Comprehensi
ve Safety Plan include 
the following: 
child abuse reporting procedures, teacher notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster response procedures, procedure
s for safe 
drop
-
off and pickup from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy. Oak Valley Elementary reviews the plan
 
annually in and updates it as 
needed.  A copy of the safety plan is available to the public at the school office.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was last reviewed and updated in February, 2019.
