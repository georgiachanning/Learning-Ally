as
 
from
 
looking
 
at
 
student
 
data,
 
it
 
was
 
decided
 
this

to
 
focus
 
on
 
conducting
 
Lesson

centered
 
on
 
integration
 
of
 
the
 
arts
 
and
 
technology
 
with
 
the

the

and
 
trauma

for

focused
 
on
 
integrating

with
 
the

and
 
will
 
later
 
this

focus
 
on
 
research-based
 
arts
 
strategies
 
used
 
for
 
managing
 
trauma
 
based
 
behavior
 
in
 
the
 
classroom.
 
Early
 
Wednesdays
 
are
 
used
 
to
 
support
 
teachers
 
in
 
our
 
school's
 
second
 
year
 
using
 
Visual
 
Thinking
 
Strategies
 
(VTS),
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
providing
 
exploration
 
time
 
of
 
the
 
NGSS
 
science
 
standards.
 
Additionally,
 
each
 
grade
 
level
 
will
 
have
 
met
 
three
 
times
 
during
 
the
 
year
 
to
 
collaborate,
 
unpack
 
standards,
 
and
 
plan
 
for
 
Lesson
 
Study.
 
Teachers
 
are
 
supported
 
in
 
implementing
 
what
 
they
 
have
 
learned
 
in
 
PD
 
by
 
on-site
 
coaches,
 
a
 
Lesson
 
Study
 
teacher
 
on
 
special
 
assignment,
 
and
 
through
 
demonstrations
 
and
 
feedback
 
from
 
consultants.
 
Teacher/administration
 
meetings
 
were
 
also
 
a
 
key
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
feedback
 
and
 
support.
 
 
In
 
the
 
prior
 
two
 
years,
 
MeadowHomes
 
had
 
a
 
School
 
Improvement
 
Grant
 
(SIG).
 
During
 
the
 
grant
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
Language
 
arts,
 
writing
 
and
 
mathematics.
 
Prior
 
to
 
the
 
submission
 
of
 
the
 
SIG
 
grant
 
application,
 
teachers
 
and
 
administration
 
came
 
to
 
consensus
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
have
 
professional
 
development
 
focused
 
on
 
balanced
 
literacy,
 
lesson
 
study
 
in
 
mathematics,
 
and
 
in
 
depth
 
data
 
analysis.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
both
 
students
 
who
 
were
 
non
 
decoders,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
those
 
requiring
 
reading
 
comprehension,
 
professional
 
development
 
focused
 
on
 
both
 
aspects
 
of
 
literacy.
 
For
 
reading
 
intervention
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
guided
 
reading.
 
The
 
SIG
 
allowed
 
for
 
creative
 
scheduling
 
at
 
MeadowHomes,
 
so
 
that
 
one
 
day
 
a
 
week
 
by
 
grade
 
level,
 
teachers
 
receive
 
two
 
hours
 
of
 
professional
 
development
 
followed
 
by
 
one
 
hour
 
of
 
collaboration
 
time
 
and
 
ninety
 
minutes
 
of
 
prep.
 
On
 
those
 
days
 
students
 
at
 
that
 
grade
 
level
 
received
 
instruction
 
in
 
the
 
different
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
"wheel".
 
These
 
included
 
computer
 
lab,
 
library,
 
music,
 
science
 
lab,
 
and
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
visual
 
and
 
performing
 
arts.
 
Teachers
 
were
 
supported
 
in
 
implementing
 
what
 
they
 
learned
 
in
 
PD
 
by
 
on
 
site
 
coaches,
 
the
 
Lesson
 
Study
 
teacher
 
on
 
special
 
assignment,
 
and
 
by
 
demonstrations
 
and
 
feedback
 
from
 
consultants.
 
Teacher/administration
 
meetings
 
were
 
also
 
a
 
key
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
feedback
 
and
 
support.
 
 
MeadowHomes
 
continues
 
to
 
provide
 
intervention
 
support
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
guided
 
reading
 
and
 
continues
 
to
 
plan
 
using
 
a
 
balanced
 
literacy
 
lens.
