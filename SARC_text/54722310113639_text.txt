School Description
 
Mission Valley Elementary School
---
"Where the Success of Our Students is Our Mission"
 
 
Dear Mission Valley 
Parents and Guardians,
 
 
One of my goals as principal of Mission Valley is to build a community atmosphere and in order for 
this to happen, it takes all staff, students, parents, guardians and other family members working 
together and communicating. So, ple
ase call if you ever have suggestions, comments, positives 
and/or concerns. We also have  two parent conferences, classroom newsletters and other 
communications that are sent home. Mission Valley is a Character Counts! school which means the 
six pillars of
 
character (Respect, Citizenship, Caring, Responsibility, Fairness and Trustworthiness) 
are modeled, integrated into lessons and are followed each and every day.
 
 
Thank you for your continued support. Go Wildcats!!!!
 
 
Gary Yentes,
 
 
Principal

About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Mission Valley Elementary School first opened during the 2007
-
2008 school year and is a beautiful facility for students to come 
to school to and for our 
staff to work at. We have thirty
-
eight classrooms that are clean, orderly and provide a safe learning environment reflective of student work and district 
approved curriculum. Mission Valley has a cafeteria that provides students wi
th a lunch program and is used as a multipurpose facility for large
-
scale 
programs, demonstrations and meetings. The school library provides students with supplemental reading materials and provides 
additional educational 
resources. Our library also houses
 
ipads which students use for a variety of educational activities. Mission Valley School's grounds and landscaping are 
beautiful with a wide variety of plants and trees planted throughout the campus. We take pride in our well
-
maintained buildings and lands
caping which 
are taken care of by Mission Valley's custodians and the school district's maintenance crew.
 
 
Mission Valley has a Safe School Plan that is in place and is updated yearly by the School Safety Committee, Mission Valley's
 
Leadership team and the
 
School Site Council and ELAC committees. Evacuation drills are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that staff and students
 
know what to do in case an 
emergency arises. A Cal
-
Osha representative attends monthly meetings and provides updates to staff on 
safety and health related issues. In addition to 
these programs, adequate supervision is provided before school, during morning and lunch recess and after school to ensure th
e safety of our students.
 
 
The Tulare City School District provides ongoing mainte
nance, and routine and major repairs for all permanent and portable buildings to guarantee all 
schools in the district are in good working order and condition. Additionally, school restroom facilities for students and st
aff are maintained so they are 
funct
ional and meet local hygiene standards generally applicable to public facilities, including operational toilets and sinks in 
all restrooms. The district 
has established a facilities inspection system to ensure that all school buildings meet the standards l
isted above.
 
 
Mission Valley has a morning custodian who works from 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. and an evening custodian from 12:30 P.M. to 9:00
 
P.M. Custodians are 
regularly monitored and evaluated by Mission Valley's principal and a director of custodians to 
make sure that the school is safely maintained and cleaned. 
In addition to the assigned school custodians, the district has a general maintenance crew that takes care of more technical 
repairs (plumbing, heating, 
cooling, gas, electrical, painting and majo
r repairs). At times, the district will hire independent contractors to work on other school and district 
maintenance needs.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study
