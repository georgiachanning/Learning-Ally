School Description
 
Principal's Message
 
McKinley Elementary School is a community of learners who share a committed focus on ensuring 
that every child who comes to our school receives an equitable education within a nurturing and 
safe environment. The strength of our school lies with the staff w
ho are knowledgeable, thoughtful, 
conscientious, and who share the belief that all students can learn and embrace the skills that will 
make them lifelong learners. Our teaching faculty of highly qualified, fully credentialed teachers is 
dedicated to teachi
ng rigorous core academic curriculum based on the Common Core State 
Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards that ensure access for all of our student 
subgroups. Educators at McKinley Elementary School collaborate and analyze data regularly to 
p
roduce deeper learning opportunities for our students that include an analysis of academic 
performance and language development to determine English Learner program needs as well as 
other student subgroups needs. Our goal is to make continuous year to year
 
growth for each 
individual student so that all are prepared for middle school, high school, college and career and 
beyond. Education requires collaboration. The McKinley staff, teachers, families, community 
members, and students will continue to communica
te clearly and work effectively to enable our 
students to succeed academically and to achieve our school
-
wide site plan goals and objectives.
 
 
McKinley Elementary School is made up of a diverse student body. The school serves students in 
grades TK
-
5. Addit
ional resources are allocated to serve students in need of math and reading 
intervention support services. Also support services are offered in Speech and Language, Special 
Education Resource Program, Adaptive Physical Education, Occupational Therapy, and 
Counseling. 
In addition, students receive instruction in Music, Art, and Physical Education.
 
 
The McKinley staff is committed to providing an educational program in which the school's 
resources and services are effectively coordinated to meet the needs of 
students. Our teachers 
strive to provide students with explicit direct instruction lessons and project
-
based learning (PBL) 
opportunities that are combined with blended learning opportunities in our 1:1 (1st
-
5th grades) 
and 2:1 (TK/Kindergarten) digital le
arning environments. It is always our goal to provide academic 
programs that are culturally responsive, rigorous, personalized and appropriately challenging for 
all students.
 
 
Instruction is focused on Common Core State Standards in English 
Language Arts and Mathematics, 
English Language Development Standards, and Next Generation Science Standards. Teachers at 
McKinley Elementary School differentiate their instruction by regularly assessing and grouping 
students within and/or outside of the c
lassroom for instruction in a variety of core academic 
content areas. Through this process, teachers are able to work together to meet the needs of all 
students by sharing resources and best instructional practices.
 
 
School Mission Statement
 
At McKinley El
ementary School, we have a unified focus: to nurture the unique strengths of each 
student so that she or he builds personal responsibility, reaches high levels of academic 
achievement and contributes positively to society. Supporting all students in meetin
g these 
aspirations takes all of us: students, parents, staff and community members. This requires our 
collective commitment to a common road
-
map, consistent follow
-
through, and a continuous 
improvement mindset.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Car
d (SARC). The SARC contains 
i
nformation about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCF
F) all local educational 
agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes ho
w they intend to meet annual school
-
specific 
goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP 
is to be consistent with data reported 
in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC 
requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or t
he district office.

hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The McKinley School Site Safety plan was last updated on December 13, 201

which time the 
Safety Plan was reviewed, updated and discussed with our School Site Council and faculty. The key element of the School Site 
Safety Plan entails 
emergency evacuation procedures. Fire, earthquake, shelter in place and lockdown drills are con
ducted on a regular basis throughout the school year.
 
 
To ensure student safety, staff members supervise students from 7:45 to 3:10 pm. All gates are locked at 8:30 each morning an

to sign in at the McKinley Office. All adults on
 
campus are required to wear ID while on campus. Volunteers are required to complete and have an

The McKinley staff love their school and continually work together to help our McKinley Eagles soar to success. This group of
 
dedicated professionals 
believes in working together to 
continuously improve our ability to meet the varied academic and social
-
emotional needs of our students. The McKinley 
teachers have had focused professional development in the areas of the Common Core Standards, Next Generation Science Standar
ds, Project B
ased 
Learning, Social Emotional Learning, Eureka Math, Social Justice Standards and Designated and Integrated ELD. This training h
as resulted in school
-
wide 
teaching and learning practices that have supported the transition to implementing the Common Core 
Standards that have allowed for deeper learning 
opportunities for students at each grade level. Grade level professional learning communities meet to plan instruction, analy
ze assessment results, and 
determine intervention and enrichment activities, and an
 
instructional leadership team meets monthly to guide the school in a process of continual 
growth.  There are weekly collaboration meetings where teachers meet in their collaborative groups and 13 after school staff 
meetings per year focused 
on school
-
wide
 
instructional initiatives. Furthermore, teachers are provided with opportunities to observe each other and get additional hou
rly pay for 
planning, and learning. Coaching and individualized support are provided for teachers through District Coaches, Site
-
B
ased interventionists, and the New 
Teacher Induction. The principal engages in regular classroom visits and learning conversations around instruction.
