School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 
2019
-
20)
 
 
North State Aspire Academy is an academic
-
alternative school for students having behavior and attendance difficulties in 
the regular education environment. The mission of North State Aspire Academy is to assist students in their progress

responsibility as it relates to academic achievement and personal development. We strive to see that each 
individual makes significant progress toward reaching their potential.
 
 
Students are encouraged to modify their behavior, improve their self

image, a
nd build goals for their future. The students 
are separated from their former peer group and placed in a smaller environment where it is safe to make self
-
adjustments 
without the pressures or influence of past associates. Upon returning to the regular scho
ol program, students report that 
North State Aspire Academy was an excellent experience. The staff find it very rewarding to see a students make the 
positive choices necessary for them to be successful.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Students cannot learn well when they are worried, anxious, or afraid, so all of our district schools provide a safe, clean 
learning environment. School 
buildings and grounds are well
-
supervised and each campus has a strict registration policy 
for all visitors. In addition, all sites have procedures in place to handle emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, or intrud
ers 
on campus. Procedures are practiced 
regularly so that students become comfortable with them and are prepared for 
emergencies.
 
 
Within the Cascade Union Elementary School District, we are committed to continually maintaining and improving our 
school facilities. All of our sites have undergone
 
modernization.
 
 
North State Aspire Academy is housed adjacent to the Anderson Heights Elementary School campus.

students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to

additional support to the student and family. Parents are invited to an orientation meeting with the Principal and teachers 
to discuss the school program, any 
special needs of the student, and parental responsibilities during the student's 
placement. The students are sent home with a report on their daily performance. Student Study Teams may be initiated 
at any time by the parents or staff.

and District administration, and is reviewed on an annual basis. The plan includes procedures for many 
potential hazards including disaster response, intruder or weapons on campus, accident response, general emergencies, 
and school evacuation procedures a
s well as reporting procedures when child abuse is suspected. Staff members meet 
regularly to discuss safety issues and take proactive steps to prevent school

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
The Cascade Union Elementary School District annually schedules time for professional development sessions for our 
teachers. Additional site
-
based staff development opportunities occur at school sites after school, during evenings, and 
over summer vacation
. Various training opportunities have included topics such as Common Core Standards
-
Based 
instruction; iReady for reading and math; reading and literacy instruction; math, science, and social studies curriculum 
support; assessment information; technology i
ntegration; student asset development; nutrition and physical education; 
brain
-
based learning; and a framework for understanding and working with at
-
risk students. Release days are also 
provided during the school year for teachers to collaborate on the wri
ting benchmarks. The central goal is to provide 
teachers with opportunities to collaborate with colleagues to focus on research
-
based techniques in order to improve 
their practice as educators. New district teachers have opportunities to take part in Allia
nce for Teacher Excellence (ATE), 
a program which pairs novice teachers with their veteran counterparts who come alongside them, working diligently to 
expand proficiency in lesson design, time management, curriculum best practices, common core standards, a
nd 
appropriate assessment procedures.
