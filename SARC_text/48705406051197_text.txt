(Most

The
 
District
 
takes
 
great
 
efforts
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
all
 
schools
 
are
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
and
 
functional
 
for
 
our
 
high
 
educational
 
standards.
  
This
 
is
 
achieved
 
by
 
custodial
 
staff
 
adhering
 
to
 
district-wide
 
cleaning
 
standards.
  
In
 
addition,
 
a
 
work
 
order
 
process
 
was
 
developed
 
to
 
make
 
certain
 
that
 
timely
 
and
 
effective
 
maintenance
 
service
 
is
 
provided
 
and
 
that
 
emergency
 
repairs
 
are
 
given
 
the
 
highest
 
priority.
 
 
The
 
voters
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
approved
 
a
 
$249
 
million
 
General
 
Obligation
 
Bond
 
to
 
provide
 
facility
 
upgrades
 
and
 
improvements.
 
Approximately
 
$19
 
million
 
was
 
allocated
 
to
 
modernize
 
the
 
campus,
 
provide
 
a
 
new
 
administration
 
and
 
kindergarten
 
classrooms
 
with
 
additional
 
safety
 
and
 
security
 
upgrades,
 
upgrade
 
the
 
technology
 
infrastructure,
 
modernize
 
and
 
expand
 
the
 
library
 
media
 
center,
 
install
 
new
 
play
 
equipment
 
and
 
shade
 
structure,
 
and
 
convert
 
the
 
existing
 
administration
 
to
 
classrooms.
 
Construction
 
started
 
in
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
2018
 
and
 
is
 
anticipated
 
to
 
be
 
completed
 
early
 
in
 
2020.
  
No
 
necessary
 
improvements
 
were
 
identified
 
on
 
the

Tool
 
(FIT).

Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
The
 
Fairfield-Suisun
 
Unified
 
School
 
District
 
requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each
 
school:
 
BP/AR
 
0450,
 
Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan;
 
BP3515,
 
Campus
 
Security;
 
BP/AR
 
3515.2,
 
Disruptions;
 
and
 
BP/AR
 
3516,
 
Disaster
 
Regulations.
 
The
 
Governing
 
Board
 
insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors
 
unique
 
to
 
each
 
site.
 
A
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
plan
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
The
 
plan
 
is
 
updated
 
and
 
reviewed
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
school
 
year
 
by
 
the
 
principal
 
with
 
the
 
complete
 
faculty.
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plans
 
include
 
the
 
following
 
elements:
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
climate
 
promoting
 
respect
 
for
 
diversity,
 
personal
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
effective
 
interpersonal
 
and
 
communication
 
skills,
 
anger
 
management
 
and
 
conflict
 
resolution;
 
disciplinary
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures;
 
prevention
 
of
 
and
 
alternatives
 
to
 
violence;
 
parent
 
involvement
 
strategies;
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
sale
 
or
 
use
 
of
 
alcohol
 
and
 
drugs;
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
physical
 
environment
 
and
 
development
 
of
 
ground
 
security;
 
school-site
 
crisis
 
intervention
 
strategies;
 
staff
 
training
 
in
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
techniques.
 
The
 
District
 
has
 
implemented
 
Positive
 
Behavior
 
Interventions
 
(PBIS)
 
The
 
primary
 
goal
 
of
 
PBIS
 
is
 
to
 
establish
 
and
 
maintain
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
climate
 
and
 
culture
 
thereby
 
increasing
 
positive
 
relationships
 
between
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
and
 
increased
 
academic
 
engagement.
 
The
 
practices
 
within
 
PBIS
 
place
 
particular
 
emphasis
 
on
 
teaching
 
and
 
recognizing
 
behavioral
 
expectations
 
specifically
 
and
 
consistently.
 
The
 
K.I.
 
Jones
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
is
 
reviewed
 
twice
 
each
 
year
 
with
 
staff
 
and
 
disaster
 
response
 
drills
 
are
 
held
 
each
 
month
 
of
 
the
 
school
 
year.
 
The
 
School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
is
 
being
 
discussed
 
and
 
reviewed
 
at
 
the
 
December
 
2019
 
and
 
January
 
2020
 
School
 
Site

and
 
is

to
 
be
 
approved
 
at
 
January

2020
 
School
 
Site

Meeting.
  
Key
 
elements
 
include
 
the
 
following:
 
Bullying
 
prevention,

response
 
procedures
 
and
