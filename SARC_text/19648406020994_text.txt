School 
Description
 
John Dolland Elementary School has three areas of focus.
 
 
We are working towards ensuring all 
students have a strong foundation in reading  to support their reading comprehension skills across 
all grade levels.   This is done by providing a con
sistent reading program that monitors and tracks 
student's development  in fluency and comprehension.
 
 
Timely and effective intervention is 
provided when needed.
 
 
In addition, classroom instruction in the area of math incorporates number 
talks and math tal
ks daily as strategies that support the development of a strong conceptual 
understanding of mathematical concepts. The final area of focus is in the area of academic 
discourse to help improve our student's English skills.
 
 
School wide goals have been devel
oped to 
monitor and track the effectiveness of identified strategies to support building these skills in our 
students.
 
 
We offer a variety of continuous programs. We provide medical services, including vision testing, 
hearing testing, and immunizations, as
 
well as dental assistance to families through a referral 
process to connect services with community resources. We also have a Bilingual Liaison of 
Community Affairs who helps develop parent workshops and trainings to help grow their support 
for student ac
ademic success.
 
 
A school Elementary Student Support Specialist helps connect 
students with individual and group counseling at the school site and family counseling and 
parenting classes (in English and Spanish). We have partnerships with affiliate agencie
s to provide 
more extended counseling and intervention support when needed.
 
 
At Dolland, we also offer a strand of Dual Immersion as an option for families to participate in 
developing and learning in more than one language. AVID (Advancement Via Individua
l 
Determination) is a school wide support that is provided for all our students TK
-
5 to support 
academic language and college and career readiness skills in all our students.
 
 
In addition to our programs, our staff and families are involved with various ac
tivities throughout 
the year. We take part in a Dr. Seuss Day celebration and Red Ribbon Week. Our students regularly 
do science experiments and participate in STEM lessons, resulting in still higher science scores on 
the state test for fifth grade. Dollan
d students also participated in weekly school wide Second Steps 
character building program. All of our students in grades 3rd through 5th participate in our school 
wide math fact contest and annual spelling bee!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional 
information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority:

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter 
Balanced Summ
ative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the

parents
 
 
These opportunities range from learning to meet the social emotional ne
eds of their children to how to partner and advocate for their child's 
academic progress.
 
 
Parents participate in Project Inspire, this is a program that is offered through CABE to help parents learn the value they b
ring by 
building a partnership with thei
r children's school. In addition, parents are invited to participate in the School Site Council, which works with 

pulations. They a
re also 
invited to participate in the Parent Teacher Association, the English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), Title I Parent Meet
ings, and to serve as 
classroom volunteers, field trip chaperones, and mentors. Dolland also offers parent classes in civic

School Safety Plan
 
Supervision aides monitor the school grounds for 30 minutes before and after school as well as at all recesses and lunchtimes
. Schoolwid
e rules are 
reviewed weekly.
 
 
Students are reminded in the Husky Weekly show to be safe, respectful and resposible across all areas of the school and on th

playground. At the beginning of the school year and again in January, assemblies were held for each
 
grade level to establish the school

wide rules and 
rewards system. We have a closed campus that is fully fenced. Visitors must enter the school through the main office entry do
or and sign in and out at 
the office, where they receive an apple sticker marke

We revise our School Safety Plan annually, and we are collaborating with the school district to align our safety plan and mak
e it uniform across the 
district. The plan includes procedures for emergencies, exit ro
utes, and inventories of emergency supplies. We make the plan available to all staff and 
keep copies in the office for parents. We share the plan with all staff during a school
-
wide staff meeting. We practice either a fire drill each month and 
participate 
in a district

In 2017
-
18, our major focus area for staff development was to continue to develop our practice with The California State Common Core 
Standards. 
Teachers received extensive training on recommended common core strategies such as close reading in ELA and laun
ch, explore, summarize in Math. 
This focus was selected based on the need to build clear understanding and build rationale for the statewide transition. This
 
focus was to ensure that all 
teachers were well prepared fort he coming year as they embarked into
 
full common core implementation. These training consisted of bi
-
monthly 
professional development sessions on minimum days in addition to full day grade level team planning days. Individual teachers
 
received mentoring and 
coaching by the Principal and dist
rict's common core coaches to support the implementation of new common core curriculum and strategies. These 
strategies were also modeled by the coaches and principal to support implementation. To support teacher practice and implemen
tation of these 
strate
gies, in class coaching and grade level team planning was utilized. In addition, during professional development days, studen
t data results from 
iReady and other common formative assessment results were analyzed to determine next steps in professional deve
lopment opportunities.
