Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-

Liberty exists to nurture and facilitate innovators' individual passion for learning. Through voice, choice, pace and path, 
learners will contribute to mankind's digitally connected world.
 
 
For the 2018
-
19 school year, Liberty had a total o
f 725 students enrolled in TK 
-
 
6th grade, not including 47 preschool 
students. The student population at Liberty is comprised of approximately Hispanic 86.07%, 7.72% White, 2.62% African 
American, .83% Asian, .41% Pacific Islander, and .14% American India
n.
 
 
The Liberty Elementary School community shares responsibility for the education of each and every student. Parents, 
teachers, and students work collaboratively to ensure that all students have the essential skills and knowledge needed to 
succeed and ac
hieve in public education. Students are expected to reach or exceed current State Standards established 
for their grade levels. Additional focus is given to developing 21st Century skills including: critical thinking, effective 
communication, problem solvi
ng, and the ability to access information. Success is measured with both formative and 
summative assessments.  Liberty is a Personalized Learning campus. We believe personalized learning can enable every 
Liberty Scholar to be a self directed individual whe
re the world is their classroom. The guiding belief for personalized 
learning builds on our school vision and mission. At Liberty, instructional practices begin and end with individualized goals
 
that are based on the standards. The intent behind our entire
 
focus is to have students own and lead their learning. We 
believe when students understand their learning styles,strengths,weaknesses, and feel a sense of urgency for 
achievement, success will follow. We hope to develop our students as a group of socially
 
engaged contributors who see 
themselves as pivotal members in their community.
