Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Donald Rheem Elementary School is currently comprised of seven buildings, including 30 classrooms, a gymnasium, library, 
one computer lab,  after school daycare 
facility, and five rented portables being utilized as classrooms. Through funding 
provided by Measure V, significant modernization efforts began in the Summer of 2019 and are nearing completion. The 
district
-
wide project intends to vastly improve the stude
nt experience through such initiatives as renovated classrooms, 
newly
-
designed bathrooms, and a rejuvenated basketball court.
 
 
Donald Rheem Elementary School provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and community members. 
Site 
custodians ensure a sanitary learning space through daily work that is supervised and inspected by site principals on 
a routine basis. All classrooms, restrooms, and athletic centers are prioritized on the regular cleaning schedule. Outside 
trash is collec
ted daily to reduce an unwanted animal presence on the school campus. The district recently added modern 
cleaning
-
chemical dispensers in the custodian closets to further guarantee the optimal cleaning agent is utilized for the 
right job. The site principal
 
and custodians work in conjunction with the district Director of Buildings and Grounds to seek 
ways to increase the cleanliness of the Donald Rheem campus regularly. The school is inspected annually by the Fire 
Marshal and periodically by school site admi
nistrators.
 
 
The repair and maintenance of Donald Rheem Elementary School are prioritized and implemented by the Director of 
Buildings and Grounds. Work is carried out by the members of the Maintenance Department to ensure that the facilities 
remain in exc
ellent repair. Generally, site custodians, secretaries, and principals submit tickets through the work order 
system for the Director of Buildings and Grounds to receive. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority, as is anything
 
that poses a threat t
o student safety. Recently, the roof for Wing 4 was replaced with a new foam structure to alleviate 
problematic leaks. Priorities for the Maintenance Department to address old roofs for Wing 1 and 3.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State p
riority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with
 
alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requireme
nts for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

in classrooms, schoo
l projects, the cafeteria, and also assist with field trips, class parties and activities, copying in the 
office, and helping at home with many projects and assignments. Our PTA offers many opportunities for parents to be 
involved in school and community r
elated events such as serving as committee chairs and members, fundraising activities, 
legislative action, communication to other parents, and school

Based Coordinated 
Program Council (SBCP), comprised of staff and parents, 
meets regularly to monitor curriculum and instruction, makes 
suggestions for improvement, and annually approves the Single Site Plan for Student Achievement. The Moraga Education 
Foundation (MEF) raises funds from the community in support of selected instr
uctional programs. Our parent community 
financially supports school personnel, activities, and events through many significant, generous donations.

16, 2016

-
18. These 
days were scheduled and held outside the 180
-
day student calendar.  The focus of these professional development days 
in 2018
-
19 was to 
educate teachers, administrators and staff about the new common core state standards, specifically in 
the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), mathematics, and English Language Arts (ELA).  The focus was selected in 
conjunction with the District's LCA
P goals.  In addition, teachers were provided opportunities to attend workshop events 
that focused on learning about common core standards and how their instructional strategies will improve student 
learning.  Release time is provided for teachers to visit
 
other schools, observe other classrooms and collaborate about 
instruction.  The Beginning Teacher Induction Program assigns new teachers with a mentor teacher.  This program is a 
two
-
year mandatory program for all new beginning teachers in the Moraga Scho
ol District. Teachers receive support from 
one another, site administrators, consultants and the MSD teacher on special assignment.
