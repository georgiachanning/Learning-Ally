History of Cold Spring School
 
T
he Cold Spring Elementary School District began legally on 
April 5, 1889, when a small plot of 
ground, a portion of Lot 162 of Old Pueblo Land of Santa Barbara was set aside for a school on the 
south side of Sycamore Canyon Road. Cold Spring School began legally in 1889, but five years 
passed before a building was
 
ready for use in 1894. The first school property was deeded to the 
School District Oct. 18, 1889, and the second section was deeded Dec. 4, 1889. This property was 
deeded to the Union Realty Company on Jan. 26, 1927, at the time of the building of the pre
sent 
school.
 
 
Cold Spring School is a TK
-
6 public elementary school District embarking on its 130th year of 
providing high quality education to children. We are a one
-
school District, and our enrollment this 
year is approximately 169 children. The school i
s proud of its comprehensive approach to 
elementary education that prepares children for success throughout their educational career, and 
helps them become active participants in our community. One fundamental key to this approach 
lies in our low student
-
t
o
-
teacher ratios (the K
-
6 class size average is 18), which gives personal 
attention to each student by a dedicated and talented faculty, coupled with strong support from 
parents and community members alike. The caliber of education provided by our staff of
 
highly 
skilled and enthusiastic teachers gives our students strength, understanding, and compassion 

 
values that will benefit our country and future generations.
 
 
Another key factor is our strong academic program that provides students with a strong base
 
in 
fundamental skills and concepts while promoting critical thinking skills, problem solving, and 
creativity. Cold Spring School students consistently demonstrate high levels of academic 
achievement on the California Standards Tests and as they move throu
gh the junior high and high 
school programs.
 
 

programs in physical education and STEAM whose aim is to create deeper connections to the core 
classroom t
hrough project based learning that completes its whole child approach to teaching and 
learning.  The Specialist programs are designed to be complementary with and integrated into 
other aspects of learning with the goal that each child gains a sense of conf
idence and enthusiasm 
that comes from being creative.
 
 
Parents play an integral role at Cold Spring School. Parents volunteer to assist in the classrooms, 
organize class activities, and support the teachers. At the school level, parents have 
numerous ways 
to be involved and support learning. The Parent Club actively supports the school community by 
sponsoring social events, welcoming new families, and raising funds to provide playground 
equipment and classroom learning materials. In addition, 
the Parent Club coordinates after
-
school 
enrichment programs, and many other programs that benefit our students. The School Site Council 
(SSC) 

 
comprised of parents and staff 

 
meets monthly to monitor and recommend improvement 

rogram. The SSC also serves as the District's Local Control and 
Accountability (LCAP) Advisory Board. The Safe Routes to School Committee promotes a safer 
neighborhood for the students and their families to walk and ride bikes to school, and schedules 
nume
rous safety programs (bike rodeo, assemblies) for the students. The Cold Spring School 
Foundation, a 501.c.3 nonprofit organization, donates approximately $150,000 per year in support 

 
technology.

There was extensive outreach in regards to the Local Control Accountability Plan via Parent Club, the Cold Spring School Foun
dation, 
monthly Principal Coffee's, the LCAP Advisory Board, ParentSquare posts, Board meetings, faculty forums, priv
ate input meetings with 
the superintendent and every teacher, and more. It is important to note that the Cold Spring School community suffered dual d
isasters 
of the Thomas Fire and the January 9, 2018, Debris Flow. The school community lost a grade six and
 
kindergarten student as well as dozens 
of our students lost their homes and possessions, and the school had to be evacuated on four separate occasions. Because of t
he disasters, 
much of our parent and faculty engagement continues to be spent on student sa
fety and trauma/recovery.   We are extremely proud of 
our parent and community collaboration as we strive to support and ensure every child is college and career ready!
 
 
THE MISSION OF COLD SPRING SCHOOL
 
is to provide a quality educational program in a sec
ure, family atmosphere, which fosters a 
balance of academic achievement, healthy personal development, social and environmental responsibility, and enthusiasm for li
felong 
learning.  Teachers, staff, parents, and the community will work together to create 
an environment in which cooperative problem solving, 
creativity, and innovative thinking are encouraged and the unique potential and of each individual student and employee is va
lued and 
nurtured.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is re
quired by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LE
As) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in 
an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members 
should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Ava
ilability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 

entary School District 
carefully selects the textbooks and
 
materials through a comprehensive process that includes staff training, extensive review by all classroom teachers, 
an opportunity for parent review through the LCAP Advisory, and adoption by the Governance Board. All textbooks and instructi
onal materials
 
used at 
the Cold Spring Elementary School District are aligned with the California Content Standards and Frameworks. The Cold Spring 
Elementary School District 
follows the State instructional materials adoption cycle, which reviews instructional materials
 
in each curricular area within a seven
-
year cycle. Each pupil 
has access to their own copy of the Standards aligned textbooks (approved by State Board of Education) and instructional mate
rials for use in the 
classroom and to take home. Some supplemental m
aterials used in language arts are not State adopted but still support the State Standards. These 
materials include a handwriting program (K
-
6) and Word Work program (K
-
6). Supplemental materials to address Common Core Standards are also being 
purchased as
 
needs are assessed (Bridges, CPM and Illuminate for math; Lucy Calkins Reading and Writing Units of Study for ELA and Amplify
 
Science).

School Facility Conditions and Pl
anned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Cold Spring School provides a safe, clean, and attractive environment for the students, staff, and visitors. The original bui
lding, which includes two 
classrooms and the auditorium, was completed in 1927. Five addition
al classrooms were built in the 1950s. A beautiful new library with an outdoor 
courtyard and fountain was completed in 1994. In 2000, six new classrooms were added, the auditorium received extensive remod
eling, and the grounds 
and parking lots were redone.
 
Three portable classrooms are used for the after
-
school day care, the art room, and an additional classroom. The Governing 
Board approved a revised campus Master Plan in Spring 2006 and is currently in the process of updating the Plan.
 
 

ntenance/Operations Supervisor and two part
-
time custodians provide custodial coverage from early in the morning until late at night 
on all weekdays. This unit ensures the classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are clean and safe. A routine maintenance 
program is administered 
to keep facilities maintained and kept in repair. Student safety and campus security is maintained by the school staff that m
onitors the playground before 
and after school, and at all recesses. All visitors must sign
-
in at the offic
e, and students check
-
in and check
-
out through the office.
 
 
In 2011, the District utilized remaining Measure C funds to replace the existing play structure, including a new soft surface
 
and replaced landscaping in 
the front of the school.  The asphalt was 
also slurried and re
-
striped.  In the winter of 2011
-
12, the administrative office and kitchen received new carpet, 
and the art room added a sink and new flooring.  In summer 2012, the remaining two portables were re
-
carpeted.  Over the Summer 2019, the ar
t 
classroom was moved to the permanent building and the art portable was removed.  The District also improved security by addin
g blinds and replacing 
all classroom door hardware and locks with new centrally controlled locking system.  Proposition 39 Clean 
Energy Grant Funds were used to replace all 
skylights, tinted the glass surfaces on the roof, replaced indoor lighting with energy efficient LED lighting, improved insul
ation and new HVAC heat pumps.
 
 
The District has also replaced all upper grade classroo
m furniture with modern flexible furniture, replaced the flooring in two classrooms, and replaced 
all classroom projectors with modern laser projectors.  The District is planning to replace all lower grade classroom furnitu
re by the end of the fiscal year.

Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school dist
rict and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The Cold Spring Elementary School District treats each school family member with the same level of priority and importance. U
nderrepresented families 
are treated like e
very other family in the District. This is one of Cold Spring School's strengths. Teachers and staff members all have strong 
ties to the 
families of the children in their classrooms. This is in part due to the fact that the class size ratio is kept below 1
8:1 and includes an instructional aide in 
each classroom. Teachers focus on individualizing the learning experience for each child using the Renaissance Learning Suite
 
of assessment instruments. 
At the beginning of each year, teachers request that parents 
complete a thorough profile of their child to help better understand the unique 
characteristics, strengths and stretches of each child.
 
 
Parents play an integral role in every aspect of the school. Parents volunteer to assist in the classrooms, organize cl
ass activities, and support the teachers. 
The Parent Club actively supports the school community by sponsoring social events, welcoming new families, and raising funds
 
to provide classroom 
learning materials. The Safe Routes to School Committee promotes a 
safer neighborhood for the students and their families to walk and ride bikes to 
school, and schedules numerous safety programs (bike rodeo, assemblies) for the students. The Green Committee support the sch
ool composting 
program and book exchange. The Well
ness Committee supports healthy food choices during school events, the 100
-

The Cold Spring Elementary School District continues to be one of the highest performing 
school districts in the State of California in both ELA and Math. 
The District has implemented Renaissance Learning Star Reading and Star Math. The high summative test results are attributed 
to the focused instruction 
provided by our teachers and the use o
f formative assessment data to monitor and adjust instruction on a daily basis. The formative assessment data is 
used to motivate student learning. The Superintendent/Principal regularly monitors student progress to ensure that all studen
ts achieve their q
uarterly 
benchmark goals. The school community is committed to a systematic approach to teaching and learning. The District developed 
and implemented a 
comprehensive Professional Learning Plan. The Plan was focused on supporting teachers with the academic 
standards adopted by the State Board of 
Education. The following highlights the progress in each subject matter:
 
 
Science: The District is in its third year implementing Amplify Science to support the NGSS. Research based instructional str
ategies have been
 
implemented for effective science instruction and student learning.
 
 
Mathematics: The District is focused on integrating mathematics into all core subject areas. All TK
-
6th grade classroom teachers work closely with the 
Music teacher, Visual Arts teacher 
and the STEAM teacher to create project
-
based learning experiences aligned to math skills taught in the regular 
classroom.
 
 
English Language Arts: The District remains committed to an effective reading and writing program. A partnership with Literac
y Partn
ers provides the 
support for training teachers in the Lucy Calkins Writing Workshop model, a Columbia University Project.
 
 
Social Studies: The District addresses the CA History
-
Social Science Content Standards through nonfiction text, literature, and commu
nity connections. 
These opportunities are provided through guest speakers and field trip excursions.
 
 
Physical Education and Health: A robust Physical Education and Health program prepares children to be physically and mentally
 
active. The sixth
-
grade 
teac

th disorders, reduce 
the associated stigma, and share wellness practices. A community partnership with the Fighting Back organizati
on provides student and parent awareness 
of the harmful effects of vaping.
