By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Washington Elementary School, home of the Explorers, is located in north Redondo Beach and is one of thirteen schools 
in the Redondo Beach Unified School District. We are proud of our richly diverse population of 800 + students who range
 
from grades kindergarten through fifth. Our staff includes a dedicated team of 50 individuals, who serve our students in 
the classrooms, the cafeteria, the office, and on the school grounds. Our instructional program includes services for gifted,
 
special 
education, limited English proficient students, and students meeting Title I criteria. Washington also houses the 
only Spanish Dual Immersion Language Program within the Redondo Beach Unified School District. Within this strand, we 
strive to promote pride 
and success through delivering a strong immersion standards
-
based program which supports our 
students in becoming bilingual, biliterate, and bi
-
cultural. We hold annual tours for this program which draws students 
from all over Redondo Beach.

emotional, physical, and academic life 
to prepare them for the challenges of this century. Both the Washington staff and 
the community strongly believe that every Washington student can achieve high academic standards, and we act upon 
that belief every day. Education at Washington School is a c
ollaborative effort between the students, teachers, 
administrators, parents, and the community at large, and all stakeholders shoulder some of this responsibility. Cooperative 

 
interventions using the Response to 
Intervention (RTI) model.
 
One of the many strengths of Washington School is the total community commitment to the education of all children. This 
is reflected in the collaboration of school staff in decision

making base
d on student needs and in the excellent support 
provided by parents through the PTA, the School Site Council, and the numerous parent volunteers who work in our 
classrooms and on our campus. The level of support we receive from the surrounding community is
 
no accident. 
Washington School uses highly effective strategies to build community partnerships and to expand and extend learning 
opportunities for the whole child in order to meet their needs. Examples of such opportunities include the Beach Cities 
Healt
h District (BCHD) providing Live Well Kids, Mind Up, campus gardens, and Walking School Bus. Washington School 
employs a part

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Washington School, we believe that successful children have involved families and successful schools encourage all 
families and community member to become involved. Parents are always welcome both in  classrooms and at whole 
school events. During the sc
hool day parents work in classrooms assisting with small groups of students or helping the 
teacher with classroom organization. It is impossible to walk through the hallways without seeing Washington families. 
We work to provide a variety of activities for
 
families to participate in school events and support their child by attending 
school functions. Opportunities include Back to School Night, Coffee with the Principal, Open House, Parent conferences, 
Family Nights, Watch DOGS, Safety Task Force, and Parent
 
Education Nights. Our PTA is active and involved in supporting 
all students at school. The School Site Council meets throughout the year to discuss our School Plan and how we spend 
money on programs at Washington School. We also have a site ELAC team that
 
means to discuss the needs and supports

The Redondo Beach Unified School District is focusing staff professional development (PD) in three main areas: effective 
instructional strategies aligned to California State Standards at schools sites; use of technology in instruction; and the 
supporting o
f the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of all students, particularly through the implementation of 
Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) in all schools. While the current PD does focus on instructional and 
curriculum in mathematics, E
nglish, and science, the RBUSD is also developing PD for History Social Science standards.
 
 
The RBUSD is engaged in a multi
-
layered approach to delivering PD. The District provides PD through: teacher release 
time; conference attendance; one
-
day workshops;
 
mentoring; book studies; and after
-

elementary schools utilize weekly collaborative planning time through the implementation of a School Instructional 
Leadership Team and grade level leads.
 
 
Targeted teacher 
development activities are essential for increasing the quality of education to students. The below topics 
are a few of the professional development areas for this school year:
 

 
Reading strategies and understanding text complexity
 

 
MTSS and Tier 2 Interventi
on Strategies
 

 
Supporting students with disabilities through inclusive practices and co
-
teaching
 

 
Grade level articulation
 

 
Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)
 

 
Student mental health
 

 
Suicide prevention
 

 
Mastery Learning
 

 
Examination of student 
assessment results
 
The use of student data is critical to better assess and support individual student development. The District provides 
training on our student data management, Performance Matters, to analyze individual and aggregate student progress. 
El
ementary teachers and secondary math teachers receive ongoing training and support on diagnosing students learning 
targets and adjusting instruction to increase number sense.
 
 
Internal PD offerings are supplemented by partnering with external professional 
development organizations, including 

teachers and administration on instructional programs for all students.
 
 
Our new teachers are supported at 
school sites and at the District level through the Beginning Teacher Support and 
Assessments (BTSA) Program where each new teacher is mentored by a BTSA support provider. By working with BTSA, a 
new teacher receives support and resources to improve their t
eaching pedagogy.
 
 
Through the collective bargaining process, additional paid professional development days are included in the teacher work 
calendar.
