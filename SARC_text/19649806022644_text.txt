District Mission
 
Extraordinary achievement for all students while simultaneously closing the achievement gap.
 
 
District Vision
 
As a community of learners, the Santa Monica
-
Malibu Unified School District 
works together in a 
nurturing environment to help students be visionary, versatile thinkers; resourceful, life
-
long 
learners; effective, multilingual communicators and global citizens. We are a rich, culturally diverse 
community that values the contributio
ns of all its members and strives to promote social justice. 
We exist to assist all students in their pursuit of academic achievement, strength of character, and 
personal growth, and to support them in their exploration of the intellectual, artistic, techn
ological, 
physical and social expression.
 
 
Will Rogers Learning Community Mission Statement
 
 
The WRLC vision is to o inspire, educate, and value all learners. As a STEM focus school, we provide 
an interdisciplinary approach to learning that fully engages s
tudents and develops literacy by 
integrating the arts, the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics across the curriculum. 
We engage in inquiry
-
based learning that spans disciplines and is culturally responsive. As a 
community, we:
 

 
know that all c
hildren can learn;
 

 
believe that social development is as important as academic development;
 

 
create a nurturing environment, in which students, parents, and staff members feel 
valued;
 

 
integrate technology to enhance learning;
 

 
design rigorous, standards
-
base
d learning experiences that meet students' diverse 
needs;
 

 
provide learning opportunities for students, parents, and teachers that encourage 
lifelong learning; and
 

 
collaborate with parents and the greater community to support student success.
 
 

essage
 
As an International Baccalaureate Candidate school, we execute our mission through an 
interdisciplinary approach to teaching/learning that engages students by integrating science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics across all content areas. Th
e overarching purpose of all 
of our work is to provide students opportunities to develop as thinkers, communicators, and 
problem solvers. To support our mission, teachers differentiate instruction and employ research
-
based strategies that enable all studen
ts to access rigorous curriculum. As a learning organization, 
we regularly engage in research
-
based professional development that bolsters our efforts to 

rich oppo
rtunities for applied learning; developing the social and emotional skills of all students; 
and partnering with parents and guardians and community members toward improved student 
learning outcomes.

To support our efforts in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
 
(STEM), we have a dedicated STEM coordinator who supports 
teachers in designing and delivering active, hands
-
on experiences across these four content areas. Teachers integrate technology into 
curriculum, instruction, and assessment using tools, such as wh
iteboards, digital document cameras, desktop and laptop computers, and 

anding that 
best occurs when they participate in activities 
that link new knowledge to existing knowledge. The greatest value in our STEM work comes 
through the exposure to real
-
world applications in STEM. More specifically, our engineering projects bridge content across the disciplines 
extending to writing and art
 
as well. As students work as engineers, they learn about the design cycle of define; develop; and optimize, a 
process to make something functional. The engineering cycle is based on the belief that we learn through failures and partial
 
successes. 
These le
arning opportunities are designed to help students develop the problem
-
solving skills, perseverance, and resilience that will 
prepare them for successful lives the future.
 
 
In addition to our STEM focus, we incorporate literacy across the 
curriculum. Teachers use research
-
based strategies to teach reading, 
writing, and vocabulary. Students read a variety of genres and express themselves in writing in every subject area. Teachers 
regularly 
examine student work to analyze and support learning
. Our literacy coach meets with the staff to provide high
-
level professional 
development, model lessons in classrooms, and work directly with students. As students read and write across disciplines, the
y develop 
content knowledge, thinking skills, and writ

instruction to meet student needs.
 
 
Our staff members focus their work on our TK/K
-

-
being, social development, and safety. We have 22 ge
neral 
education teachers, three special
-
education teachers, a literacy coach, a language and literacy intervention specialist, a school 
psychologist, a speech pathologist, and an occupational therapist. These educators collaborate to provide a rich, qualit
y education to 
children and within a warm, supportive environment. Our talented classified staff supports students and parents in in a numbe
r of settings 
and through systems that help them navigate the school environment. School visitors witness students w
ho are actively engaged in their 
learning and are accountable for their work. We have high expectations for every child at WRLC, and children work hard here, 
but they 
also have fun.
 
 
We are a Title I school and receive additional funding that enables us to
 
provide additional support services for children who need 
assistance in reaching grade
-
level standards. We have instructional assistants who support all grade levels in providing individualized and 
small group instruction in reading. Our teachers are high
ly qualified and committed to the collaboration they do with their colleagues at 
grade level and other schoolwide meetings. They participate in ongoing professional development tied to research
-
based instructional 
practices. During our professional
-
develop
ment meetings, teachers have a unique opportunity to collaborate and engage in learning 
activities that increase their understanding and ability to teach at the highest levels.
 
 
Will Rogers is highly committed to a balanced visual and performing arts progr
am for all students. All TK/ K
-
5 students participate in both 
music and visual arts programs throughout the year. Our third
-
 
through fifth
-
grade students also participate in poetry, drama, and dance. 
Come partner with our school, see our children in action
, and watch children learn and grow. This is a caring and special school. Will 
Rogers is a learning community proud of its children, its diversity, and its hopes for the future.
 
 
About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at

For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

State Prio
rity: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the
 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eli
gible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

We welcome and encourage parent involvement in many different ways. In the previous year, WRLC parents logged more than 10,00
0 volunteer hours. 
Parents are active members of our PTA, En
glish Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), and School Site Governance Council (SSGC). We offer various 
trainings and workshops on a regular basis. Parents are well informed as to how they can be involved in our school at a varie
ty of levels, especially worki
ng 
in SSGC and PTA to participate in decision making. The PTA continuously lends support and financial assistance to a variety o
f school programs such as 
music, art, classroom supplies, technology, and field trips. Parents are also encouraged to volunteer 
in the classroom or for our Jog

We col
laborate with the PTA conduct monthly parent education seminars on topics of interest to our community. At these events, we p
rovide child

care 
services, food, and translation services. Research shows that students with involved parents, no matter what the 

more likely to have better attendance records, earn higher grades and test scores, and have better social skills than those w
hose parents are not involved. 
Working together as a learning community, we can reach the hig
h expectations we have set for each and every child.

Professional Development is the centerpiece for our ongoing, continual growth as a 
teaching staff.  Each Friday morning, students start school at 9:45, 
rather than 8:25. This provides us with three 90
-
minute bank time sessions per month that are devoted to professional development. The fourth bank 
time is reserved for teacher preparation
 
and planning. At one of these meetings each month, we met as a whole staff. We refer to this meeting as School
-
as
-
a Whole (SAW). During SAW meetings, we participate in professional development on topics related to our school plan. Twice a 
month we partici
pate 
in professional learning communities (PLCs) in which teachers regularly analyze student work and assessment data and design a
nd adjust instruction, to 
address that data.
 
 
PLC work is one of the most powerful and effective forms of professional develop
ment.
 
 
We examined multiple forms of data to choose topics for PD. When we looked closely at our SBAC data from previous years, we n
oticed that students 
struggled on the writing claim in ELA and the communicating reasoning claim in math. To address this, o
ur main focus for the 17
-
18 & 18
-
19 school years 
was writing, specifically narrative, informative, and argumentative/opinion writing. In addition, we examine student data and
 
our needs as educators 
regularly and address topics including, but not limited to
: standards
-
based instruction; balanced literacy; mathematics; assessments; Response to 
Intervention (RTI); meeting needs of diverse learners; social curriculum; and STEM.
 
 
In addition to our Friday bank time professional development, we set aside funds fo
r teachers to attend trainings in the summer and during the school 
year. A significant part of our professional development is our work with the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project fr
om Columbia University, 
New York City. In addition, we are have 
achieved the status of International Baccalaureate Candidacy; this has resulted in significant professional 
development and collaboration.
 
 
Our Literacy Coach meets with grade
-
level teams, models lessons in classrooms, and collaborates with teachers to des
ign and deliver instruction.
 
 
Each August, all teachers new to Santa Monica
-
Malibu are invited to participate in Teacher Academy, a professional development and orientation to 
districtwide curriculum and instructional initiatives. All eligible new teachers
 
are encouraged to participate in BTSA. Teachers interested in applying for 
National Board Certification may participate in the process and can elect to be supported by teachers who have already achiev
ed National Board 
Certification.

https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that contains additional information about 
this school and comparisons of the school to the district
 
and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
g English learners).
