By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Tustin Unified School District takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist 
in 
this effort, the District uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of Californ
ia Office of Public School 
Construction (OPSC). The results of this survey are available at the school office, the District office, or on the Internet a

Tool. The District maintenance staff ensures that the rep
airs necessary to 
keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to 
ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority.
 
 
Beswick had extensive upgrading comple
ted in 2003
-
2004. Restroom facilities and all classrooms were made ADA 
compliant as were bus and car access areas. The administration building and multi
-
purpose room were both re
-
roofed 
and exterior lighting was enhanced. During the summer of 2013, the ent
ire school exterior was painted. Each classrooms' 
technology was upgraded throughout the campus to include a larger SMARTBoard, Apple TV, sound system and new 
teacher laptop or desktop. In the summer of 2016, Beswick's MPR was upgraded with new technology 
and sound 
equipment. A recent inspection of our facility found the school to be rated GOOD in every category of inspection.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Date Last Reviewed by School Site Council (SSC): 02/5/2019 (Pending 02/24/19)
 
Date Updated and Approved by SSC: 02/5/2019 (Pending  02/24/19)
 
Date Discussed by Staff: 8/08/2019
 
 
Our School Safety Plan includes the following elements: Child abuse reporting procedures, disaster procedures, routine 
and emergency (SEMS); suspension, expulsion, or mandatory expulsion recommendations; procedures to no
tify teachers 
of dangerous pupils; discrimination/harassment policy; provisions of any school
-
wide dress code; procedures for safe 
ingress and egress; safe and orderly environment; rules and procedures on school discipline and dress code; hate crime 
report
ing; school safety goals and objectives. We run monthly drills and work closely with our Student Services department 
to ensure that we have updated procedures and practices in place to ensure school
-
wide safety.
 
 
Student safety is of utmost importance at B
eswick Elementary School. A comprehensive safety plan is part of our overall 
School Improvement Plan and is revised and assessed annually. Students and staff participate in both emergency drills 
and fire drills. Prior to these drills, students are taught t
he appropriate safety practices and staff members are trained on 
their specific area of support. After each drill, the staff reviews the effectiveness of our procedures and makes any 
necessary revisions. Emergency preparedness supplies and equipment are in
ventoried on an annual basis to ensure that 
the needs of our students will be met in the event of a disaster. A Crisis Response Team has been initiated at our site as 
well as a redesigned communication corridor to improve the speed and accuracy of communic
ation in the event of a 
disaster.

Tustin Unified School District provides dedicated time for professional development for all staff.  Schools often provide 
additional professional development time based on specific school
-
site scheduling and budgetary decisions.  The District 
provides inte
nsive workshops in August during the week before school starts to provide teachers with new knowledge 
and enhanced skills for the upcoming year.  Staff development opportunities are also offered after school and by release 
time throughout the school year. 
 
Additionally, professional development is provided one non
-
student day in the fall and 
one afternoon per month after school.  New teachers are provided an extensive new teacher training program throughout 
the year to support their implementation of effect
ive instruction.
 
 
Beswick Elementary surveys its teachers as well as reviews the results of assessments to identify areas of need and 
schedules staff development to strengthen the educational program. We analyze data trends and teachers have PLC time 
avail
able every Monday and twice a month on Wednesdays. We also have monthly Banking Minutes Professional 
Development opportunities. During these times, teachers receive training in literacy, mathematics and English Language 
Development. The staff utilizes data
 
analysis protocols to systematically evaluate the results of assessment and evaluate 
instruction and drive decision making. In addition to site based activities, teachers participate in a variety of District in
-
services as well as professional development
 
workshops and conferences to enhance their knowledge and instructional 
skills, especially in the areas of Balanced Literacy and Conceptual Mathematics. Over the past three years, there have been 
summer institutes, summer training on campus around CGI and 
Balanced Literacy, and ongoing coaching from our Connect 
Coach and expert push
-
in coaching.  Beginning teacher Induction Programs, District workshops, and professional 
conferences are also opportunities for professional development. The District continues 
to train teachers in strategies to 
deliver a differentiated curriculum with depth and complexity. Teachers utilize student assessment results to target 
instruction to better meet the individual needs of students. Our school wide focus is CGI, STEAM, and Ba
lanced Literacy 
Practices.
