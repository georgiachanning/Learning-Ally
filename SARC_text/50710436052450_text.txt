By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

-

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
2019/10
 
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 12, 2019, and determined that
 
each school within the district had 
sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English Learners, are given their own 
individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home.
 
 
Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Educat
ion, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are reviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators.
 
All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.
 
 
The table displays information collected in August, 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

The school site had 10 collaboration/early release days and
 
5 professional development days during the 17/18 school year.  
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, the school site has planned 21 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional 
development days. For the 2019
-
2020 school we have increased the number of 
collaboration days to include 5 school
-
wide professional development days, 14 collaboration / early release days, 11 math professional development days, 10 
grade level meeting days and 10 instructional professional development days.
 
 
Staff development is a
 
critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a variety of professional development opportunities for staff.  Staff and grade level meetings are held on Monday's 
after school. The teachers collaborate
, learn strategies, examine data and develop action plans to meet identified student 
needs. Teachers are provided with additional collaboration time, once a month during early release days, during 
collaboration assemblies and during PLC rotations. After sc
hool workshops are held based upon teacher request or need.  
Conferences are attended by school leaders, both admin and teachers, to support current initiatives/goals.  Student 
achievement data is monitored continually throughout the year to inform instruc
tion and identify school wide areas of 
focus.  Walter White continues to focus on literacy, math and increasing our positive behavior support programs.  There 
is a laser focus on English Learners in relation to these goals.
 
 
Walter White has seven minimum 
days for conferences. The district participates in an Induction program and state 
approved formal training programs dedicated to improving teacher quality.  In addition, the district fully supports 
classroom teachers with full time staff developer/coaches 
who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and 
strategies. Teachers utilized their time with these staff coaches individually in the classroom and during grade level team 
release time.  Walter White is assigned two coaches who also assist with st
aff development during staff meetings and 
professional development days.  Site administration meets with teachers and teams on a continual basis to review needs.
 
 
School sites must include a professional development plan and budget in their school site pla
n. All professional 
development is aligned to the district strategic plan. The goal of all professional development is to increase student 
achievement.
