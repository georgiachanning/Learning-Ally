School Description
 
Our mission is to ensure that ALL Harborside students receive a rigorous, high quality instruction in 
a collaborative learning environment where there is an emphasis on academics as well as social/ 
emotional learning. We want to ensure that all students de
velop the confidence and necessary 
skills to be independent thinkers, effective communicators, and be socially conscious and 
contributing global citizens.
 
 
Our Vision
 
We believe that Harborside Elementary School provides a safe and rigorous 
learning environment 
where our children are encouraged to be critical thinkers, leaders, collaborators, culturally 
proficient, and biliterate.
 
 
We believe that every adult and every student will act with compassion, treat one another with 
respect, and mode
l positive behaviors on a daily basis.
 
 
We believe that every child is capable of learning and adults and children will actively support the 
learning efforts of others.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publi
sh a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare 
a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent 
with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information abo
ut the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school 
principal or the 
district office.

in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are

Parent Participation. Research shows a high correlation between parent involvement and effective school
s.  We encourage our parents to become 
actively involved in our school.  We have regularly scheduled community meetings and Coffee with the Principal meetings to ke
ep parents informed of 
the school events and to address any questions or concerns to help im
prove the school.  At Harborside, we consider our parents to be active participants 
in shaping the direction of the school along with the school staff.  Many of our parents volunteer in the classrooms, provide
 
morning supervision and our 
curriculum nights 
are designed keep parents informed about assessment, curriculum and instruction. We have an active Parent Room where parents 
can 
take classes, help teachers, volunteer, and have a welcoming environment when they are on campus. Parents are provided with e
du
cational resources 
and strategies to strengthen the home and school connection. Additionally, we work with and collaborate with the Promise Neig
hborhood partnership 
to work with a Parent Liaison (Promotora) who promotes parent involvement, volunteerism, an
d works to support all our parent connections and 
community structures.
 
 
Parent involvement is highly encouraged at Harborside and workshops are offered throughout the year to support parents with t
he necessary skills 
needed to help their child at home.

Social Emotional Learning and School Climate
 
Harborside is dedicated to create a positive environment for students to reach their maximum potential.  Harborside has creat
ed a Positive Behavior 
Interventions and Support committee(PBIS).  The committee is working on creating a consistent practice in de
aling with discipline in a positive and 
restorative manner.  The committee will be working on creating the supports and interventions for the three tier system..  Th
e committee has created 
four core values with the acronym of ROAR.  Students are expected t
o use respect, ownership, acceptance and responsibility when present in all the 
different settings in our school campus.  A behavior flowchart has been established to address the different stages of discip
line.  All staff members have 
received the Sanford 
Harmony team building kit to implement in the classroom.  Teachers will be instructing one Harmony lesson per week and 
conducting community circles daily.  As part of the ongoing professional development, quarterly training for PBIS have been c
alendared.  
The committee 
created ROAR tickets as part of the incentives to motivate them to follow core values.
 
 
Safety
 
Safety is a key value at Harborside Elementary. All potential district employees are screened and fingerprinted to help ensur
e a safe learning envi
ronment 
for all students. An emergency card is on file for each child in the health office, and teachers also have emergency informat
ion cards in the classroom. 
Parents are asked to notify the school and classroom teacher when their contact information cha
nges. The entry and exit of volunteers and visitors is 
closely monitored through registration and tracking by the Raptor Visitor Management System.There is adequate supervision dur
ing all recesses. Children 
and playground supervisors are instructed on the 
proper use of equipment at the start of each school year and as needed throughout the school year. 
The School Safety Plan was approved on October 16, 2019.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Staff development activities are planned, carried out, and evaluated for the purpose of improving the knowledge and skills of
 
all our staff members based 
upon a careful analysis of student data.  Examples of student data analyzed include: Language Arts and
 
Mathematics data, Benchmark Assessments, 
Writing Performance Tasks, Local Measures (Reading, Writing and Mathematics), and ELPAC data.  Activities take into considera
tion the effect of staff 
development on the instructional program for all students.  Base
d upon the analysis of student data, the following professional development activities 
were focused on:
 
 
The 3
