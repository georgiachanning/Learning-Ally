By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
J.H. McGaugh School's mission is to provide all students 
with a positive and challenging learning environment which 
empowers them to become responsible and productive citizens. At J.H. McGaugh School, we believe that students learn 
best when a supportive, rigorous, and enriched learning environment is provided. 
The teachers, staff, students and 
community are committed to the following school goals:
 
 
 
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES 

 
Working together in grade level teams, across grade levels, and as a school 
to provide the best possible academic, artistic, soci
al, and emotional experience for students.
 
 
Teachers regularly spend 
time together sharing exemplary lessons, looking at the results of common assessments to guide instruction, planning 
instruction for their students, doing research, and discussing best pr
actices.
 
 
McGaugh administration is committed to 
supporting and fostering this collaboration.
 
 
 
 
INTERVENTION 

 
Recognizing that if students are not learning in class, it is our responsibility to teach them using 
alternate methods and additional instruction
al time. This includes using regular assessments to identify students who 
are not meeting grade level standards and then providing intervention opportunities for these students 
during 
the 
instruction day via a Response
-
to
-
Instruction (RTI) model.
 
 
 
 
INCLUSI
ON 

 
Teaching, supporting, recognizing, and appreciating the large population of students with special needs 
that are part of our learning community.
 
 
McGaugh hosts exemplary special programs that meet the needs of students 
at 
every 
level including academi
c, social, emotional, and behavioral.
 
 
The McGaugh community seeks to integrate and 
naturally include students with special needs in the general school environment whenever possible.
 
 
LANGUAGE ARTS 

 
McGaugh provides a comprehensive and balanced literacy p
rogram which includes skill 
development, a love for reading and literature, and language
-
rich activities. The Writer's Workshop model and research 

rkshop 
model and comprehension strategies are used to create independent readers who use
 
meta
-
cognition
 
and expert level 
thinking to read and analyze texts. Thinking Maps and the Depth and Complexity Icons are used at all grade levels to 
support student wr
iting and comprehensions skills.
 
 
 
MATHEMATICS 

 
Providing a balanced program of skill acquisition through concrete experiences and problem solving 
strategies with an emphasis on real
-
life applications. Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) allows students 
to 
demonstrate and share their mathematical thinking, allowing the teacher to provide individualized and focused math 
instruction. 
 
The web
-
based MIND Spatial
-
Temporal (JiJi) curriculum uses adaptive and interactive mathematical 
modeling to increase studen

 
 
 
 
SCIENCE 

 
Ensuring that all students demonstrate mastery of the state science content standards by providing hands
-
on, 
inquiry
-
based learning experiences that incorporate science process skil
ls and the scientific method. 
 
Science journals 
are used by students to document and extend classroom learning.
 
 
Technology is used to give students access to 
scientific experiences, models, and current academic research pertinent to their learning. Additi
onally, all students in 
grades TK
-
5 have access to the innovation lab where hands
-
on next
-
generation science experiments are offered.

THE ARTS 

 
Continuing the school tradition of arts excellence including our exemplary school music program, our 
outstand
ing art studio and instruction, and our annual Pageant of the Arts which has been the gold standard for original, 
school
-
based artistic performances in Orange County for the past thirty
-
five years.
 
 
 
 
TECHNOLOGY 

 
Increasing access and use of technology to 
enhance literacy and content knowledge while preparing 
students for life and careers in the 21st century. 
 
McGaugh's infrastructure has been upgraded
 
to provide wireless 
access for students throughout the school. Each classroom is equipped with newly
-
insta
lled short
-
throw projectors and 
accompanying document cameras. 
 
Teachers have access to six Chromebook carts, two iPad carts, and we have a 1:1 
BYOD program in grade three through five. 
 
In addition, the campus has a 42
-
station desktop computer lab that is
 
accessed by students in grades K
-
5 on a regular basis depending on grade level. 
 
 
McGaugh is also using several 
researched based software programs such as Reading Plus Intervention,
 
 
MIND ST Math, and MIND Fluency to support 
and extend student learning.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
11/2019
 
 
Los Alamitos Unified School District sets a high priority upon ensuring that 
high quality, standards
-
based textbooks and 
materials are available for every student to support instructional programs in the schools. Prior to adoption, the Los 
Alamitos Unified School District conducts a thorough review of its curriculum to ensure that 
it is aligned with the California 
Standards for the Common Core. Under California law, the State Board of Education reviews K
-
8 textbooks and other 
instructional materials and then adopts those meeting specific quality standards. In the Los Alamitos Unifie
d School 
District, textbooks considered for adoption are carefully reviewed by a committee of teachers and administrators. The 
most promising programs are piloted using established criteria and guidelines. The recommended books are then 
approved by the Los
 
Alamitos Unified School District Board of Education. To receive State instructional funds, the Los 
Alamitos Unified School District ensures that it has fully complied with the requirements of Education Code Section 60119. 
The District has also conducted a
n annual public hearing ensuring the sufficiency of instructional materials. Each school 
maintains a library/media center which is supported by the District.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The Los Alamitos Unified School District has always emphasized the importance of a clean, safe environment for 
learning. The environment of each campus is a matter of pride for students, staff and parents. Several schools have 
planted individual gardens, o
rganized workrooms, and planned workdays for students and parents to enhance the 
facility. To insure that our facilities are in good repair condition, custodians at each site perform monthly inspections and
 
the District maintenance crew places safety as th
e number one priority. J.H. McGaugh was built in 1954. Overall the 
school is in good condition. It is clean and well maintained. Voters within the District boundaries approved a local bond 
in 2008. Due to the passage of the Measure K Bond in 2008, all scho
ol sites within the District were modernized. The 
modernization work included the installation of new roofs, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, fire alarm and data systems. The 
doors, windows and flooring were replaced along with all new restroom fixtures. The mo
dernization of J.H. McGaugh 
Elementary School was completed in MONTH & YEAR. Additional information about the condition of the school's 
facilities may be obtained by speaking with the school principal.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of stu
dents who met the standard (i.e., 
achieved Level 3
-
Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who partici
pated in both assessments.
 
 
Note: Double dashes (
--
) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is t
oo small for statistical 
accuracy or to protect student privacy.
 
 
Note: The 
number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, t
he number of students tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level 
percentages are calculated using only students who received 
scores.

Professional Development (Most Recent Three Years)
 
 
The primary areas of focus for staff development are the 

(CGI), Readers & Writers Workshop, Reading Foundations for the Common Core (RFCC), Thinking Maps and Depth and 
Complexity. Student data is collected via District benchmarks and various formal a
ssessments, such as CAASPP and 
Fountas & Pinnel Leveled Reading Assessments, to determine instructional needs for teachers. The District provides annual 
training to ensure accurate calibration in the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in
 
order to assess 
site vs. district
-
wide areas of concerns.
 
 
Professional development is delivered by way of release time for teachers in the all of the Signature Practices. Teachers 
new to the Los Alamitos Unified School District are placed on a five
-
year 
professional development plan. Teachers are 
placed into cohorts according to the number of years with the District and attend professional development sessions. 
Teachers are also released to attend pre
-
approved workshops and conferences with the expectatio
n of disseminating their 
findings by way of instructional networking. The District also provides content specific training when needed by 
departments or grade level teams.
 
 
Teachers are supported through on
-
going, in
-
class coaching by District TOSAs. Site 
administrators provide regular, ongoing 
feedback by conducting classroom observations, setting individual goals for teachers, and by providing time for teachers 
to collaborate and review data within grade level teams, subject teams and departments. Teacher
s are provided 
opportunities to participate in instructional networking where teachers observe other teachers and debrief on the 
instructional strategies employed within the lesson. The practice of instructional networking is cross
-
curricular and non
-
evalu
ative.
