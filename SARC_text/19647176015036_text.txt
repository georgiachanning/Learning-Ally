School Description
 
Jersey Avenue Elementary School, located in the beautiful city of Santa Fe Springs, California, is a 
California Distinguished School serving students TK 
-
 
5th grade. Jersey was most recently named a 
California Distinguished School in 2018 and had previousl
y earned this award in 2010. Jersey earned 
the Model Professional Learning Community at Work award in 2017 and has also been named a 
Title I Academic Achievement School four times since 2009. Additionally, the California Business for 
Education Excellence (
CBEE) Honor Roll has been awarded to Jersey Avenue eleven of the past 
twelve years (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018). Jersey was 
also named a California Gold Ribbon School in 2016. These recognitions are significant ind
icators 
of the hard work and dedication of the teachers, staff, parent volunteers, as well as all of our 
community partners.  While these state recognitions are outstanding, the most meaningful 
recognitions come from the parents and students that attend Je
rsey.  Last school year, when 
surveyed about their satisfaction with Jersey Avenue Elementary School, parents responded with a 
resounding 95% satisfaction rate.  These results are an outward expression of the inner drive and 
dedication of the teachers, sta
ff, and parent volunteers that serve the students at Jersey Avenue 
Elementary School.
 
 
With a primary focus on student achievement, Jersey Avenue Elementary School offers multiple 
programs to support student learning.  These programs include core instructi
on following the new 
California State Standards.  Jersey Avenue also offers the Arts for All music, art, and physical 
education program.  Further, Jersey Avenue Elementary School is home to the THINK Together and 
Stone Soup after
-
school programs.  These pr
ograms offer low and no
-
cost options for students to 
extend the educational program past the instructional school day.
 
 
In addition to all this, Jersey Avenue has made a concerted effort to increase student use of 
technology in every classroom.  To support the use of technology, Jersey offers every student, TK
-
5, with online access to outstanding adaptive learning programs 
such as Reading A
-
Z©, Raz
-
Kids©, 
and iReady©.  These resources are available to students while at school as well as through any 
Internet
-
connected phone, tablet, or computer to extend learning beyond the walls of the 
classroom. These highly engaging progra
ms are made available through the funds that Jersey 
receives through the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP).

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (S
ARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (
LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For mor
e information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web
 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Jersey School was built in 1957 and is in good condition. In the 1990s, Jersey added t
wo portable classrooms and a new library.
 
 
Campus cleanliness is of utmost importance here at Jersey. Our custodians ensure that all classrooms and restrooms are cleane
d on a frequent basis. 
They also keep our campus litter
-
free.
 
 
Exterior lighting was rep
laced throughout the campus in 2019. Wireless internet access was installed throughout the entire campus in the same year.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Willia
ms legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildings: their structural integrity, electrical sys
tems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine i
f our buildings and grounds are safe and in good repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assessment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to making those repairs. The guidelines f
or this assessment were 
written by the Office of Public 
School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the six

Inspection Tool used for the assessment on the Web site of the OPSC.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental 
Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
At Jersey, all parents are highly encouraged t
o get involved!  Our 3
-
tier approach to parent involvement ensures that parents are involved at all levels at 
our school.  Tier one includes all of our parent
-
teacher conferences, assemblies, meetings, events, and promotions.  The second tier consists of f
unctions 
that support student success such as our room parents, coffee club, and other volunteer opportunities.  The final tier includ
es parent leadership at Jersey.  
This includes our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), School Site Council (SSC), and our E
nglish Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC).  All parents are highly 

-
door policy ensures that all parents feel welcomed.
 
 
In addition to leadership and volunteer opportunities, t
he Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) funds opportunities for parents to attend conferences. 
Jersey sends a cadre of parents to a local PTO conference annually. LCAP 28 specifically funds a Family Math Night, STEM Nigh
t, in addition to any parent 
tra
ining. This allows parents to deepen involvement and leadership within the school. LCAP funds also support each parent event 
with providing food 
and childcare. This increases access to parent events and encourages all to attend.
 
 
Most importantly, parents 
know they are an integral part of student success at Jersey Avenue Elementary School.  94% of parents feel welcomed when 
they visit Jersey.  Furthermore, 93% of parents feel that school
-
parent communication, as well as information regarding student progres
s, is excellent.
 
 
 
State Prio
rity: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Every mo
rning, the principal, and/or a parent volunteer, and student valets are in front of the school in the drop off area ensuring 
students get into 
campus safely and that the traffic keeps flowing.  On campus, there are two teachers on morning duty in the lineu
p area ensuring students are safe. Two 
Student Supervision Assistants (SSA's) assist with morning supervision in the MPR. One additional SSA is assigned to supervis

Jersey teachers have multiple opportunities for professional development (PD) throughout the school year. Teachers participat
e in three district
-
wide 
professional development days on Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) through the UCLA Science Project
. During these days, teachers receive 
grade
-
specific training. At the school site, teachers will also participate in targeted, purposeful, and ongoing site
-
based professional development during 
the school year (including, but not limited to Math, ELA, NGSS
, PBIS, and Growth Mindset) and will include the district TOSA's as needed. Teachers, along 
with the administration, will participate in vertical articulation in math with all grades led by our district Math TOSA's. T
eachers in grades 3
-
5 will also 
partici
pate in ELA vertical articulation. The Student Achievement Leadership Team (SALT) will also meet several times throughout the
 
school year and 
continue on
-
going professional development in alignment with Innovate Ed. Jersey's focus is writing across all con
tent areas. As always, teachers will 
receive additional training and support with the use of technology, especially as it relates to Raz
-
Kids© and i
-
Ready©.
 
 
All PD days, materials, and release time are funded through Local Control Accountability Plan (LCA
P) funding 7. LCAP 7 provides release time to allow for 
grade
-
level collaboration and for teachers to do peer
-
observations. These funds also provide professional conference opportunities including CUE 
(technology
-
based) and CARS (for Special Education teac
hers).

Types of Services Funded
 
The Little Lake City School District provides additional services for students using federal funds (Title I, Title III, Title
 
IV) and LCAP funds.  Title I funds are 
primarily used to support all students using a Response to Intervention (RtI) model.  At th
e elementary sites, Interventionists are funded to provide 
differentiated instruction to meet the needs of all learners within the RtI model in ELA and mathematics during the school da
y.  At the middle schools, 
Interventionists monitor student academic pro
gress and determine placement for intervention based on student needs.  Title I funds are also used to 
support parent involvement at both the site and district level.  Title III is used to provide supplemental services to all En
glish Learners including add
itional 
tutoring beyond the school day, and professional development for EL Coordinators.  Title IV funds provide students with a wel
l
-
rounded education and 
supports using phenomena in NGSS
-
designed lessons through the creation of NGSS kits.  In addition, 
these funds support safe and healthy students 
through the implementation of a social emotional learning program, Second Step, which is a proactive approach to building ess
ential social and behavioral 
skills.  LCAP Funds are used to supplement services for 
English learners, low income students, and homeless/foster students.  Some actions and services 
include additional counselors, professional development for teachers, supplemental materials, parent engagement opportunities
, and student 
motivation activities
.
