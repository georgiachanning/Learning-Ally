Dual Language Spanish Immersion:  Meeting the criteria set forth by Proposition 227, we offer 
students the opportunit
y to participate in a research
-
driven program that teaches students to 
become bilingual/bi
-

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 

 
from its most recent facility 
inspection in June 2018.  The district govern
ing Board has adopted cleanliness standards for all district schools to ensure that all schools are clean, safe 
and functional.  The district Operations Department takes great pride following a work order process that provides efficient 
and timely services
 
to all the 
sites.  The principal works directly with the site custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure that the school is
 
clean and safe.

Quick Strike projects during the summer of 2014, which allowed schools to pick from one of the following improvements: 1) mar
quees, 2) closed
-
circuit 
television (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior painting,
 
or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district schools 
were upgraded.  Additional 10 million dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to beg
in in 2019.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes
 
the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

2017 school year.  The purpose of the P.T.O. at Kemble is to strengthen the 
relationship between the home and school, so that parents and teachers may cooperate 
for the success in the education of children at our school.
 
 
Parent Leadership Classes
 
A full time parent resource center is available for parents to engage in classroom volunteer support, attend parenting classe
s or seek additional ways to 
help their chil
d.  We also offer computers for parents who may need it to look for listings for job openings.
 
 
Parent Coffee Chat
 
Each month we meet with parents to discuss topics/ideas generated by parents based on needs and interests. Our Student Suppor
t Center 
helps facilitate

Professional 
Development provided for Teachers
 
 
To realize the vision of Sacramento City Unified School District, which is to fully prepare all students for college and care
er, it is imperative that the district 
provides numerous opportunities to expand the professiona
l repertoire of its administrators and teachers.
 
 
To that end, the district has crafted a high quality professional leaning program that is focused on Literacy (including ELA 
Common Core Standards), 
English Language Learners, Differentiation of Instruction
, Data Inquiry, Culturally and Linguistically Relevant Teaching and Learning, and Conceptual 
Understanding of Mathematics. The learning opportunities afforded through this program deeply align with the needs of our ind
ividual schools, as well 
as our Local 
Control Accountability Plan, and connect to every aspect of school practice: thinking curriculum, intentional instructional p
ractices, 
assessment for learning, and lesson design.
 
 
Professional learning opportunities are offered during school hours and outs
ide of contracted hours. In addition to on
-
site coaching and regular 
professional learning opportunities, a designated collaborative Thursday time provides the opportunity for teachers to engage
 
in collaborative 
professional learning at their respective sc
hools focusing on deepening their content knowledge, strengthening their instructional repertoire, improving 
their assessment strategies, and fostering a shared sense of responsibility.
