By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

aligned and are 
purchased for each student who is identified as an English learner.  An inventory is completed for each classroom at every 
school site and is reported to the District Office
 
to ensure that sufficient materials are available for the new school year.  
This inventory is completed in March/April of each year to prepare for the following school year.
 
 
The district is phasing in a new science adoption, the previously adopted, state
 
framework aligned, textbooks will remain 
in use until the new adopted books are implemented at district schools. The new Science adoption is beginning in 2019 
and will be in use August of 2020.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Every student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To help schools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has 
mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 

local public safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teach
ers, administrators, and other persons interested 

preparedness, mitigation and prevention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the 
California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 

sites and provides correction reports to site administ
rators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction of discrepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills for anticipated emergency situations (such as fires, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and
 
other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district follows 

System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Sa
fety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and recovery of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
The common goal of all categorically funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally 
disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
only, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process tha
t includes members of the school 
community such as the principal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises 
a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which al
l students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have difficulty mastering academic state and local content standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds a
re supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that augment the core instructional program and increase the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
suppl
emental student materials, and other specialized services, equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical 
programs have been established at the district level to provide important services and 
instructional support that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant A
ward (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
S
tudents
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At
 
the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest needs, based on a variety of data, including local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Prog
ress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is used to identify schools and student groups in need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).

The goal of all professional development is to increase student proficiency in core subject areas. Targeted support is 
provided in the areas of culturally relevant instruction, st
rategies to assist English Learners, essential components of an 
ELD lesson, implementation of the Common Core State Standards, creating rigorous standards
-
aligned units of study, 
building a solid foundation in Algebra, GATE strategies, implementing Positiv

collaboration/ coordination with local university 
programs, online delivery of professional development content and individual mentoring.  Opportunities are created for 
development in curriculum writing, assessment of standards and instructional best pract
ices, including teaching to the 
appropriate depth of knowledge and disciplinary literacy.
 
 
Additionally, Special Education offers a variety of PD opportunities to support the Individual Education Plans (IEPs) of 
identified students. Professional developmen
t is focused around current district, state, and national trends in the area of 
Special Education. At present, available topics include successful implementation of strategies for students with Autism, 
curriculum for different disability groups, behavior m
anagement, data analysis, social skills, English Language 
Development (ELD), Behavior Support Plans (BSPs), and legally defensible documents that best support students and meet 
state requirements.
