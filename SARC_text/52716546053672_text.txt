About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a
 
School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Lo
cal Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with
 
data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about t
he LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or 
the 
district office.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade elev
en. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabil
ities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

Richfield appreciates the involvement of parents in our school. Many parent volunteers help in the classroom, on field trips,
 
at K and 8th grade graduation, 
in the snack bar as well as nearly 
all school events.  Richfield has a dedicated and strong PTO that actively supports the students and staff. The P.T.O. 
raises money annually that goes directly to the benefit of all students.  Teachers meet with parents before and after school,
 
and at bi
-
a
nnual conferences.   
Teachers also communicate electronically regularly via online grade books, email and other electronic applications. Richfield
 
parents are encouraged to 
be an active force in our school.  Parents hold seats on School Site Council, which
 
also serves as the DSLT (District School Leadership Team) and the Safety 
Committee.  Our site council and DSLT group provide input and help guide the development of the LCAP.  Parent surveys have be
en posted on our website 
and sent home to gain feedback. 
 
We have an annual Grandparents Day Celebration, Ham Dinner, Back to School Night etc. All events are very well 
attended by parents and the community.  Richfield School also has a District English Learners Advisory Committee (DELAC) that
 
meets regularly, c
onsults 
and gives input on the overall ELD program, the LCAP and on the direction of the school.

monthly.  Safety training is provided for all staff each year and all staff are certified in ALICE safety protocols. Security
 
cameras and shatterpro
