The School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC) was established by Proposition 98, an initiative 
passed by California voters in November 1988. The SARC, to be issued annually by local school 
boards for each elementary and secondary school in the state, provides parents and other 
interested p
eople a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the 
areas in which improvements are needed.
 
 
Branch Elementary School serves students from the rural countryside near Arroyo Grande, located 
along the picturesque coastline 
of San Luis Obispo County. Originally founded in 1889 by F.Z. 
Branch, the school maintains a sense of its rich history and close
-
knit family feeling, while providing 
a rigorous academic program. The caring, dedicated, and experienced staff works in tandem 
with 
parents and community members to ensure all students at Branch Elementary School receive the 
highest quality education possible.
 
 
Branch is focused on the 21st
-
Century Skills of critical thinking, problem
-
solving, teamwork, and 
collaboration. These sk
ills are developed extensively through writing, interdisciplinary projects, and 
a "facilitative" and student
-
centered approach to teaching and learning. Branch has a lab dedicated 
to hands
-
on science. All grades participate in 3
-
4 major labs a year, facili
tated by our science 
advisory committee and focused on the five areas of STEAM. All labs are aligned to the NGSS 
standards. Branch is also proud to be the first elementary school in our district to provide 1:1 
technology for all our students in grades 2
-
6 
via Chromebook carts in the classroom. This year, 
professional development is centered on grade
-
level math collaboration (through the PLC process) 
and the "Daily 5" literacy framework.
 
 
School Mission and Vision Statements
 
The mission of Branch Elementary 
School is to inspire learners through inquiry, investigation, and 
imagination in student
-
centered classrooms where collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and 
communication are emphasized to promote student understanding and transfer of learning. 
 
 
O
ur Vision for Branch Elementary is to provide a safe, supportive, engaging environment where 
school, family, and community collaborate to:

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planne
d Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Branch Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for learning. Built in 1961, and modernized in the summer of 2002
, Branch Elementary 
School is situated on 7.09 acres. The school buildings span 25,158 square fee
t, consisting of 12 classrooms, a library, an office, a computer lab, a 
multipurpose room, and a science lab. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and pl
ayground space.
 
 
In 2018, the District recently completed a
 
power upgrade and a rip/replace of the parking lot asphalt.  In the planning stages are a classroom addition to 
allow for the replacement of the MPR, and a domestic water system upgrade.
 
 
Personnel from the facilities department meet with the principal on
 
a monthly basis to ensure the buildings and grounds are kept in proper condition. 
The School has one full
-
time janitor and one part
-
time janitor that works evening shifts three times a week. Students are supervised by school personnel 
before, during, and 
after school hours to ensure their safety.
 
 
Branch Elementary School is a closed campus. Many people visit the campus to volunteer in the classroom and participate in sc
hool events. Parents and 
visitors are welcomed and required to check
-
in at the school 

office upon departure. During lunch, recesses, and before and after school, adults supervise students and school grounds, suc
h as the cafeteria and 
recreation a
rea, to ensure a safe and orderly environment.
 
 
Safety concerns are the No. 1 priority of maintenance and operations. District maintenance supervisors are proactive and cond
uct inspections at school 
sites on a continual basis. Repairs necessary to keep the
 
school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work
-
order process 
is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The District maintenance staff
 
has indicated that 100 percent 
of 
all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
A team of custodians ensures classrooms, campus grounds, and restrooms are kept clean and safe. A scheduled maintenance progr
am is administered 
by Lucia Mar Unified School District to ensure that all cla
ssrooms and facilities are well maintained and provide a suitable learning environment. A 
summary of these standards is available at the school office or at the District office.

wide staff development in key initiative areas aligned to district goals to increase student 
achievement and support school improvement. Each school year our 
professional development focused on California Common Core State Standards, 
21st Century Skills, English Learners, and best practices in using technology for instruction/ assessment.  In the 14
-
15 school year LMUSD created a 
research
-
driven professional de
velopment model. Each school site has a Late Start Monday, an Instructional Leadership Team comprised of teachers and 
administrators, and Teacher Support TOSAs. The combination of these three has resulted in high quality, weekly professional d
evelopment.
 
 
Professional development opportunities are provided in a variety of ways 

 
one district
-
wide staff development day, weekly late
-
start Mondays, monthly 
staff meetings, release time, optional after
-
school professional development (Tuesday Tidbits, Google Cer
tification training) and summer institutes. Over 
the last three years, teachers have received at least 38 days of professional development in each school.
 
 
In 2019
-
20, Branch Elementary is focusing on grade
-
level math collaboration and the Daily 5 literacy
 
framework.  In August of 2019, all teachers reviewed 
CAASPP and NWEA MAP math data.  Teacher
-
teams identified target areas (grades 3
-
6 used CAASPP results) and math goals (K
-
2 used MAP results) to 
work on during Late Start Monday professional development.
  
Principal and TOSA meetings with each grade level have also helped identify areas of need 
to better plan for professional development.  Teacher teams identified goals, planned for materials and implementation, and r
eview student data on an 
ongoing basis.
  
2020 CAASPP data will be reviewed the following school year to review the impact of our efforts.  In 2018
-
19, everal teachers visited 
another school in our district to observe "The Daily 5" and "CAFE".  This year, through a book study and TOSA support, a
nd trial and error, teachers are 
learning about Daily 5/CAFE with school

State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The Comprehensive Safe School Plan was developed by the District to comply with Senate Bill 187 (SB 187) of 1997. The Plan pr
ovides students and staff 
a means of ensuring a safe and orderly 
learning environment. Each school includes the following requirements of SB 187 within their Safe School Plans: 
current status of school crime; child abuse reporting procedures; disaster procedures, both routine and emergency; policies r
elated to suspensio
n and 
expulsion; notification to teachers; sexual harassment policy; provision of a schoolwide dress code; safe ingress and egress 
of pupils, parents, and school 
employees; safe and orderly school environment; and school rules and procedures.
 
 
The school e
valuates the plan annually and updates it as needed. Safety procedures, including elements of the Safe School Plan, are revie
wed with school 
and District staff in the fall, at the start of each school year. The Injury, Illness & Prevention Plan was last up
dated and reviewed with school staff in 
August of 2019.  All school staff has recently completed ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) training and our 
site safety plan has been 
updated to reflect the change in practice.  The school safety pla
n was most recently adopted on December 4, 2019.  The most notable change to the 
school safety plan is the addition of two exit
-
gates along the perimeter of the school that will be used for any evacuation and/or reunification purposes.

Career Technical Education Progra
ms
 
The Board of Education realized that students have varying academic interests and aptitudes, and that they need to be better 
prepared for options other 
than a four
-
year university directly from high school, particularly in light of the rapidly changing 
workforce technology and employment environments in 
many industry sectors. Therefore, the Board of Education sought to support Programs of Study to ensure that all students grad
uating from the Lucia Mar 
Unified School District have the preparation necessar
y for success in any post
-
secondary pursuit, whether it is university studies, technical training, 
workforce placement, military enlistment, or service as a community volunteer. 
 
 
As vocational education evolved in the 21st century, it became known as Career Technical Education (CTE). Business owners, tr
ade union leaders and 
educators came together to change how occupational and technical subject matter were delivered in high school
, college and technical training 
environments. This resulted in the need to develop robust and rigorous curriculum provided in a cyclical continuum that engag
es participants in the most 
common tasks and skills required in a broad umbrella of employment opp
ortunities within a specific industry sector. High School Career Pathways provide 
the first two to three years of instruction and skill development in this scenario. 
 
 
Pathway programs in LMUSD are designed so that students are able to gain at least one in
dustry certification, or equivalent skill measurement, to provide 
a competitive advantage in the job market. Additionally, curriculum will coincide with community college career certificate a
nd associate degree 
programs in same/similar industry areas and i
n some cases allow students to earn college credit for their coursework while still in high school. This will 
shorten the time it takes students to earn post
-
secondary degrees/certificates and enter the skilled workforce. The California Department of Educa
tion 
gives guidance for the design of model CTE programs in their plan for Career Technical Education, which was adopted by the St
ate Board of Education in 
2008. 
 
 
The same quality program indicators were taken into consideration during the development of 
career pathway programs of study for LMUSD. Specifically, 
the focus of pathway preparation has been on assessing current programs and facilities, establishing relationships with indus
try members and assembling 
advisory committees for new programs, reviewin
g and developing curriculum, reviewing instructor training needs, determining outreach/communication 
needs, and researching funding options for new and existing pathway programs.

The Director of CTE provides direct support to instructors, pathway program
s, and site administration in the areas of curriculum, facility and equipment, 
postsecondary alignment, industry partnerships, and overall pathway focus. CTE teachers participate in professional developme
nt to stay up to date with 
changes in industry by at
tending workshops, conferences, and other training opportunities. Additionally, CTE instructors focus on pathway development 
and philosophy, which include California State CTE Frameworks and model standards, as well as funding legislation that affect
s the 
structural make up of 
CTE programs. This baseline of CTE supports has continued to improve annually in the support of current programs that are fun
ctioning well, retooling 
programs that have minor areas of weakness, building out viable pathways from progra
ms that currently function as a single course, and establish new 
programs where programs do not exist but there is a regional workforce need. 
 
 
Several CTE programs participate in Career Technical Student Organization (CTSO) activities and competitions thr
ough the Future Farmers of America 
(FFA), SkillsUSA, and HOSA. The Culinary Arts, Agriculture, Design, Visual, Media Arts, and Animation programs have all had r
egional contest student
