School Description
 
Warm Springs Elementary School is nestled at the foot of the San Francisco East Bay hills.  Its 
historical significance and beautiful architecture offer a sense of great pride to the community, who 
val
ues excellent schools and holds high educational expectations for their children.  In 2016, Warm 
Springs was proud to be recognized with the California Gold Ribbon Award and in 2018 Warm 
Springs was recognized and won the California Distinguished School aw
ard.
 
 
At the core of our mission is the student as an individual.  We are committed to the academic, 
physical, and emotional well
-
being of every young person in our care.  Our school operates within 
a cohesive and integrated network of academic 
programs, co
-
curricular activities, and support 
services.  These are supported by our character education program, which is integrated into our 
English/language arts curriculum and is designed to ensure, first, that no child at our school feels 
alienated o
r bullied and, second, that every child makes a meaningful connection with peers and 
adults on campus.  Teachers incorporate into their classes the Eight Great Traits concepts, and 
academic programs are rich, challenging, and aligned with Common Core Stand
ards.  We have seen 
a continuous and sometimes dramatic increase in our state standardized test results over the last 
few years.
 
 
The essence and strength of Warm Springs are in our diversity.  We have students of many ethnic 
backgrounds who speak over 20 
languages or dialects and bilingual teachers representing eight 
different languages.  Students come to us from the local homeless shelter as well as the expensive 
homes on the hill, with performance ranging from low communicative students in our moderate
-
t
o
-
severe Special Day Class (SDC) to the gifted mainstreamed child.  Together we strive for 
excellence as measured against standards and our own individual potential.  There is something at 
Warm Springs to inspire an interest or passion for learning in ever
y student.
 
 
The final component of our integrated network is support services.   Every student is given the 
support necessary to achieve excellence.   We are especially pleased with the during
-
school English 
Language Lab and intervention classes we offer f
or struggling students (federally
-
funded), the 
friendship groups, and the one
-
on
-
one interaction offered by our contracted counselor.
 
 
Regular, in
-
depth self
-
evaluation and revision of our programs and practices are essential to our 

elebrate our successes and focus on areas where we can improve learning 
for each student.  The success of Warm Springs can also be attributed to the sustained and 
invaluable partnership that exists between students, parents, faculty, and community.

About the SARC
 
By 
February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control 
Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
st
ate and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about th
e school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Warm Springs Elementary was opened in 1937 with one building, which housed a multipurpose room, administrative office, and cl
assrooms.  In 1960 a 
kitchen room was added.  Three buildings were added in 
1964, consisting of a library, five classrooms added to the main building, and an eight
-
classroom 
building wing.  We added a six
-
classroom building wing in 1965, one modular classroom in 1990, two in 1994, and another two in 1998.  In 2000 six 
modular clas
srooms and a restroom were added to the campus.  We have a multipurpose room and an outdoor eating area with a newly added co
ver 
and asphalt.
 
 
Warm Springs Elementary was modernized in 2001 and now has a newly remodeled library, computer lab, adult restroo
ms, and science lab. Air
-
conditioning or air
-
ventilation units were installed in all regular classrooms. Handicapped access and upgrades were also included. Three tempora
ry 
classrooms have been added since 2004.  During the summer of 2008,  Warm Springs ha
d two construction projects.  First the school underwent another 
modernization, which included new fire alarms, installation of a high
-
efficiency HVAC system in all classrooms, and complete renovations of all restrooms.  
The second project was the building
 
of a two
-
story portable with seven new classrooms, a restroom, and an elevator to meet Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) requirements.  In summer 2009, Warm Springs had the playgrounds and parking lots resurfaced. This project completed
 
the modernizat
ion of 
the school and made it as aesthetically appealing as it was when it originally opened.  In the spring and summer of 2011 over
hangs built in 1963 were 
removed. They were replaced with a more aesthetically pleasing overhang which ties in our hallways 
and walkways providing shelter to the students.  In 
the Fall of 2013, a new portable was added to accommodate continued growth.  In the Fall of 2016, we added a brand new, 12 cl
assroom, permanent 
building for our expanding student population as well as the
 
eventual conversion of third grade moving to 24:1.  The most recent construction project is 
an update of our internet infrastructure.  This will provide our students and staff a much larger bandwidth to use the intern
et.  Teachers and students 
continue to
 
use online learning more and more, each year and on a daily basis.  We currently have 12 mobile carts with 30 devices on each
 
cart.  Teachers 
check these out daily to use them in their classrooms.
 
 
Our custodial crew cleans the campus daily, and the distr
ict maintenance and operations departments make repairs and improvements as needed.  Due 
to our growing needs, we have added two more full time custodians to our night shift.  This will be needed to accommodate the
 
12 new classrooms.  
Fremont United School
 
District maintenance staff works very hard to ensure that repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working ord
er 
are completed in a timely manner.  District maintenance staff uses a work order priority process to ensure efficient service 
an
d to give emergency repairs 
the highest priority.
 
 
To determine the condition of our facilities, our district sent experts from our facilities team to perform an inspection usi
ng a survey called the Facilities 
Inspection Tool, which is issued by the Office
 

Please note that the information reflects the condition of our buildings as of the date of the report. Since that time, those
 
conditions may have c
hanged.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and

community.  We not only welcome parent involvement, we depend on it.  Our School Site Council (SSC), English Language Advisor
y Committee (ELAC) 
and Parent 
Teacher Association (PTA) have strong parent involvement and meet regularly to provide support, input, and direction on how t
o best serve 

pate and go on study trips, and 
support the classroom teacher.  The Principal and Assistant Principal have an open

This ensures that the parent/school partnership is effective in meeting 
all the student needs.

staff.  Our site Safety Committee and our 
School Site Council (SSC) review and update our Comprehensive School Safety Plan annually.  It was last revised in March of 2
019.  The committee guides 
us in reviewing drills and emergency plans and maintains a fol
der of emergency procedures and student behavior situations for each staff member.  We 
have a fire drill each month and four disaster drills each year.  Our staff has regular discussions on safety and the adminis
tration instructs staff on how 
to handle une
xpected safety issues and how to report potentially hazardous onsite situations.  We are guided by the district's Risk Manage
ment 
Department as well as the Fremont Police.  In many classrooms, firemen help teaching safety lessons, and PTA has created well
-
stocked emergency 
supply buckets for each classroom.  Students are also required to bring in an emergency food pack that is stored in the class
room in case of an emergency.  
There is a clipboard with emergency procedures hanging by the classroom door.

Professional Development provided for Teachers
 
 
Teachers take some time each year to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of the sub
jects they teach.  Below is the amount of 
time we set aside for the past three years for their continuing education and professional development:
 
 
2016
-
2017: 3 days
 
2017
-
2018: 3 days
 
2018
-
2019: 3 days
 
 
Three days are set aside each year, but due to 
budget cuts and related negotiations these days are sometimes reduced.
