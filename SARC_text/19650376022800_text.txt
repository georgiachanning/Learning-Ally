Description
 
Our mission is to ensure that all scholars have the academic skills and character traits that are 
necessary to be successful adults. We know that our scholars have several external factors (socio
-
economic status, English as a second language, f
oster youth, etc.) that make learning complex.  We 
are dedicated to unwrapping the complexities and providing scholars with the tools to cope with 
and overcome external factors.  We promise to value the diversity of our scholars' population and 
work dilige
ntly to provide the best instructional practices.   We will honor each scholar by providing 
a safe and positive environment where everyone can learn and develop intellectually, socially, and 
physically. We seek to instill an appreciation for cultural sensi
tivity, a positive attitude toward self 
and others, and the responsibility for lifelong learning skills. Together, the staff at Carmela, our 
parents, and our community stakeholders will empower students to prepare for an ever
-
changing, 
diverse, competitive
, and complex world.
 
 
In accordance with our mission, Carmela offers several programs to assist in the full development 
of a scholar. Academically, we provide whole group instruction with research
-
based student 
engagement strategies and GLAD strategies thr
oughout the curricular day. We also provide small 
group instruction and an RTI intervention model for striving scholars. During this intervention, 
scholars are provided with extra opportunities to learn the core curriculum.  Additionally, we 
provide lesson
s on the top 10 scholarly character traits.  Scholars are expected to model these 
behaviors and are reminded/rewarded monthly at our Spirit Assemblies. Additionally, Carmela is a 
PBIS school with an anti
-
bully program.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every 
school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all loca
l educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Addit
ionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://ww
w.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and
 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructi
onal Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Our school complies with the Williams Law; every child has an appropriate textbook for all academic subjects requiring textbo
oks.  Students are allowed 
to take their textbooks home for study after school when needed.  T
he school uses district and categorical funds to provide supplemental materials for 
the classrooms including classroom library books, as well as materials for intervention and ELD.
 
 
A process is in place for schools to order materials at the beginning of t
he school year for all students.  In addition, there is a process to order additional 
materials throughout the school year in order to address the changing needs of our student population. Schools notify the dis
trict staff when a new 
student registers for 
classes so appropriate materials can be ordered.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
This school has 27 permanent classrooms, a multipurpose room, and an administration building. The main campus was built in 19
59. In 2000, eight new 
classrooms were built. The new 
restroom building was constructed in 2001. During the summer of 2016, the Administration building was completely 
remodeled.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are complet
ed in 
a timely manner. A 
work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. A district 
safety consultant inspects each 

hip in a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) property and liability collaboration 
provides annual site inspections.
 
 
The principal works daily with the custodial staff to develop cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe school.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible s
tudents 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parent partnerships are a vital part of the school community. At Carmela, our parents have am
ple opportunities to become involved with his/her child's 
education.  Carmela parents can become involved by joining formal committees that include:  School Site School (SSC), and Dis
trict Advisory Committees/ 
English Language Advisory Committee (DAC/ELAC/
LCAP). Parents also attend the annual Back to School Night, Open House, and Fall and Spring 
Parent/Teacher conferences. There are also several community events including Family Math Night, Family Reading Night, Family
 
Pumpkin Carving Night 
and Family Bingo
 
Night.   We also have several learning opportunities for our families.  These include PIQE classes, English classes, and the 
Latino Literacy 
Program.  We also have grade
-
level specific classes that teach parents grade level expectations based on Common Co
re standards.  Additionally, we offer 
a Kindergarten Orientation each year.  Other methods of daily communication with parents and families include automated/perso
nalized parent portal 
system, and telephone calls regarding student progress, "good news" cal
ls, and absences.  Parents also received support from our Community Liaison 
based on their individual needs.

School Safety Plan
 
As required by state law, each school maintains a detailed safety plan; the Plan was revised in August 
2019. Carmela school has a well
-
organized disaster 
preparedness program which includes emergency supplies.  All personnel is trained in emergency procedures and students take p
art in regularly 
scheduled emergency drills. Food, water, medical and other emer
gency supplies are updated annually to ensure each campus is ready to respond in the 
event of an emergency or disaster. Campuses are carefully monitored before, during and after school hours. Break periods and 
lunch are supervised by 
school personnel. Scho
ols are secured with security fencing. Check
-
in and check
-
out procedures are also strictly enforced at all campuses. The District 
maintains constructive relationships with law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of all campuses. Furthermore, through
 
Measure W funding (a 
general obligation bond passed by area voters to upgrade school facilities) all schools have upgraded communication systems a
nd radio communication 
at all times. The School Safety Plan is updated annually in September and as needed.

Types of Services Funded
 
At Carmela, we provide an extensive intervention model with the support of three Instructional Aides and two half time creden
tialed teachers.  Together, 
our 
teachers, Instructional Coach, and support staff hold grade level data meetings to create scholars groups to meet the academi
c needs of our scholars.  
Based on their needs, we create small group intervention groups that receive differentiated instruction 5
 
days a week within the classroom.  We have 
also hired Instructional Aides to provide additional class support on a daily basis in our 5th and 6th
-
grade classrooms during math instruction. In addition, 
one of our instructional aides is providing additional
 
support for our newcomer students.  Furthermore, scholars also have access to Myon. This computer
-
based program gives scholars access to over 2,000 books through the online library.

ally, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for 
accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regardin
