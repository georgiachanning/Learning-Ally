By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and 
month in which data were collected:
 
2019 August
 
 
Folsom Cordova Unified held a Public Hearing on December 19, 2019, and determined that each school within the District 
has sufficient and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equip
ment pursuant to the settlement of 
Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned 
textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom and
 
to take home. Textbooks and 
supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State Department of Education, making the 
textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed b
y all 
teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and 
administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. 
The table displays in
formation about the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

School Facility Conditions and Planned 
Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cordova Gardens Elementary was originally constructed in 1965 and consists of 21 classrooms, one multipurpose 
room/cafeteria, a library, staff lounge, and three separate  playground areas. Our interior spaces were improved
 
in 2006 
with paint, cabinetry, carpeting, and other improvements. Our instructional programs are housed in comfortable settings. 
The spacious playgrounds and athletic fields provide adequate space to separate primary and intermediate students. The 
followi
ng areas have also been updated: restrooms, roofing, plumbing, and other areas. Our electrical capacity was 
significantly increased to allow for the growing use of technology throughout the school, including a multimedia computer 
lab connected to the libra
ry media center. In conjunction with the city of Rancho Cordova, through Measure H funding, a 
new garden area was built in August 2017.
 
 
All of our classrooms are equipped with Smartboards and LCD projectors to enhance educational opportunities for our 
stu
dents as instructional materials are saved in the Smartboard Notebook for access by all and allows internet access for 
instructional purposes that can be viewed simultaneously by students.  These instructional tools support a comprehensive 
learning process
 
in a collective and collaborative manner. Our custodial staff works hard to keep our facilities neat, clean, 
and safe for our students, parents, and the community.
 
 
The athletic fields and multipurpose room are used by the local Little League, Cordova Par
ks and Recreation Department 
programs, and the Lancer Rugby Club. The extended use of school facilities at night and on the weekends helps reduce 
instances of vandalism of the school site. Improvements to the athletic fields and the planting of additional 
shade trees 
are helping to keep the grounds safe and attractive.
 
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are 
completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure effic
ient service and highest priority is given to 
emergency repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection 
process. The items noted in the table have been corrected or are in the process of remedi
ation.
 
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building 
componen
ts. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor 
systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASP
P] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eig
ht and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant 
cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or progr
ams 
of study.

Note: The number of students t

s tested 
is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calc
ulated using only students who received 
scores.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-

Cordova Gardens is a beautiful, safe and clean facility.  We pride ourselves on the wonderful custodial and yard 
maintenance support we receive at our school. High traffic areas like restrooms and eating facilities are thoroughly cleaned 
daily. Teachers ma
intain excellent habits of cleaning practices at the end of each school day and classrooms are cleaned 
on a regular basis by the custodial staff on site. Any safety hazard that is reported is reviewed immediately and resolved 
at the site and/or district le
vel. Safety plans are reviewed each fall and spring with the staff. Emergency plans have been 
developed in case a threatening situation should arise.
 
 
A School Safety Committee reviews emergency procedures and campus safety issues annually and makes 
recomm
endations for improvement. Two
-
way, hand
-
held radios are used daily to assist with communication around 
campus. Monthly drills include staging scenarios to assure that students and staff are prepared to react to a variety of 
emergency situations. Evacuatio
n plans are in place should students need to be moved away from buildings or to another 
location off campus. Hour
-
Zero Crisis Consulting Ltd. has collaborated with district and school staff to create a 
comprehensive plan to deal with emergencies that might
 
occur on or near the campus.
 
 
The school reported 5 student accidents to the district office in the 18
-
19 school year.
