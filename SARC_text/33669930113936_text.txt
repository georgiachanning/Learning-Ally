Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Tournament Hills Elementary was originally constructed in 2007 and is comprised of 35 classr
ooms, a multipurpose room, 
a library, a staff lounge, a computer lab, numerous conferencing and administration rooms, and a playground. Cleaning 
Process: The administration works daily with the custodial staff of three (one full
-
time day custodian, one ful
l
-
time night 
custodian, and a three hour night custodian) to ensure that the cleaning of the school is maintained to provide for a clean 
and safe school. The District's Board of Trustees has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the District. A sum
mary 
of these standards is available at the Educational Support Facility for review.  Maintenance and Repair by District 
maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and work orders are completed in 
a timely manner
. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and highest priority are given to emergency 
repairs. While reviewing this report, please note that even minor discrepancies are reported in the inspection process. 
The items noted in the table have
 
been corrected or are in the process of remediation.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:  The District participates in the State
 
School Deferred Maintenance Program, which 
provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or 
replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing
, heating, electrical systems, 
interior or exterior painting, and floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: 
Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter
 
Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible st
udents may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The perc
entage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

The school in collaboration with the district has a volunteer application system that ensures we have approved volunteers 
at no cost to
 
our families. The school has a strong base of parent volunteers who provide ongoing support for the 
classroom teachers. Parents are encouraged to join the PTA, which currently has hundreds of members at Tournament 
Hills Elementary. Our School Site Council
 
(SSC) and English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC) meetings are held on a 
regular basis and all are encouraged to attend. The school also benefits from several community partnerships such as the 
Rotary Club which is a sponsor of our Early Act Club which
 
meets monthly at the site. Other community sponsorships that 
help us recognize our students for academic and social achievements are from various local businesses. The school 
supports the Relay for Life event through a variety of fundraising activities. W
e also participate in an annual Canned Food 
Drive through the San Gorgonio Pass area HELP Organization, and the Winter
-
Wish program to help those in need during 
the Holidays.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The safety of the students and staff is a primary concern of Tournament Hills Elementary. The school is in compliance with 
all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to school safety.  The comprehensive School Safety Plan was reviewed and 
adopted by the S
SC team on 2/25/19. Every year our classified and certificated staff complete training sessions within our 
Hour Zero Emergency Response Plan program.
 
 
The school's current disaster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety duri
ng a disaster in 
alignment with our Hour Zero safety program. Fire, Lock down, and Earthquake disaster drills are conducted on a monthly 
basis throughout the school year and documented through our Hour Zero online Program.  Students are supervised before, 
after, and during school by classified staff, certificated staff, and administration. Classified staff and the administration
 
supervise students during breaks such as recess and lunch. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up. All 
visito
rs and volunteers are required to sign in through the Raptor system, using proper ID, prior to entering the school 
grounds. We are a "closed" campus for the 2019
-
20 school year which allows parents to volunteer during the school day 
in classrooms but does 
not allow parents or community members to roam campus during unstructured times (before 
school, recess, lunch).
