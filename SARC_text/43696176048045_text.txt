School Description
 
Ida Jew Academy is a Dependent Charter School that converted from an Intermediate school in 
2009
-
2010 where it became a school that integrated the Dual Language Academy, the Visual and 
Performing Arts Academy, and the STEM Academy.  Operating as three isol
ated academies, the 
school flourished for five years before it became united as a STEAM/ALAS School that integrated 
the areas of focus:  ALAS, VAPA, and STEM. The school still consists of three specialties: Academic 
Language Acquisition in Spanish (ALAS) a
 
Two
-
Way Dual Immersion Program, Visual and Performing 
Arts (VAPA) and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).
 
 
Students at Ida Jew Academy focus on Spanish Language Development, Visual Arts, Music, Dance, 
Science, Technology and/or Math d
epending on their chosen specialty. All students are held to high 
expectations where they aim to be proficient or advanced in core areas of the curriculum:  English 
Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Sciences.  For those students that are appr
oaching 
standard in the core areas, our teachers offer after school intervention that provides additional 
opportunities for students to get extra support in a small group setting. The teachers at Ida Jew 
Academy are highly qualified and use the most effect
ive teaching strategies including:  Gradual 
Release of Responsibility, Kagan Cooperative Learning strategies, AVID strategies, and integrate 
facets of Social Emotional Learning and Growth Mindset. Teachers collaborate every Wednesday 
either as a Specialty 
department, Grade Level/ Grade Cluster, or School
-
Wide team. In addition Ida 
Jew Academy has (5) planning days that are used for full
-
day collaborations and instructional 
planning.
 
 
In 2016, the school recently underwent a renovation where the Cafeteria, p
rimary classrooms, and 
Science Lab were improved through district efforts and the Synopsys Global Volunteer Project.  The 
Synopsys grant also provided our school with beautiful murals, benches, gardens, Science Lab 
furnishings/ equipment, and blacktop reno
vations.  The district's maintenance department 
renovated classrooms with upgraded classroom sinks, carpet, and teaching walls.
 
 
Our Vision 2018
-
2019
 
Ida Jew Academy will provide an exceptional education through the integration of curriculum: 
Language Arts (ELA/SLA), Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics, and Physical 
Education.
 
 
Mission Statement 2017
-
2018
 

creativity, critical thinking, co
llaboration, and communication skills to produce well rounded life 
long learners who are socially responsible and prepared for college, career, and their future in their 
ever changing century.
 
 
Our Staff
 
Ida Jew Academy provides classes fr
om Transitional Kindergarten (TK) through 8th grade.  We have 
(22) classroom teachers, 1 Intervention teachers, one Technology/Science Teacher, a Dance 
Teacher, and a part time art teacher.  Among our staff, we also have a part time health clerk, speech 
th
erapist, library technician, four instructional aides and a Special Education (Resource Specialist) 
teacher. We are extremely fortunate to have a full time family case manager to support our 
students and families.  Our staff, both Classified and Certificat

Curriculum and Instruction
 
Ida Jew Academy has invested high amounts of energy into improving instructional pr
actices that align with the newly adopted Common 
Core State Standards where our focus has been on offering students ample opportunities to collaborate, communicate, criticall
y think, 
and use their creativity.  Among our multiple programs and curricular ado
ptions, we began piloting EL Education in 2013
-
2014, which is 
an English Language Arts curriculum in grades 6
-
8.  This program focuses on novel based instruction where students are exposed to higher 
level thinking and challenging ways of interacting with t
ext and evidence based instruction.  Our school has fully adopted the EL Education 
curriculum and is now utilized in 3rd
-
8th grade English Language Arts classrooms.
 
 
In regards to Mathematics, we are currently utilizing two Mathematics programs; Eureka Mat
h and College Preparatory Math (CPM).  In 
TK through fifth grade, all students are using the Eureka Math, which is also a Common Core aligned curriculum that challenge
s students 
to engage in Mathematical practices and concepts.  In middle school (6
-
8), stu
dents are exposed to the CPM curriculum that is also aligned 
to the Common Core curriculum. It is focused on student engagement and rigorous opportunities to engage with the middle schoo
l 
concepts and practices.  Aside from our core curriculum, Ida Jew Aca
demy students have access to dance, art, music, a maker space, a 
science lab and multiple forms of mobile devices.  Currently, we are fortunate to have five Chrome book carts, one I Pad cart
, and a Mac 
Lab.  In addition, our Transitional Kindergarten throu
gh Second Grade  Students have art, music and dance throughout the year with our 
Specialty Teachers and access to teacher developed electives.  Students in grades 3
-
5 are exposed to areas of Specialties in the form of 
student selected and teacher developed
 
elective classes.  Students in grades 6
-
8 choose an area from the Specialties (ALAS, VAPA, STEM, 
and AVID) to specialize where they are dedicated to the Specialty for the duration of middle school.  Selected 6th
-
8th grade students also 
participate in AVID
, a college readiness program known as Advancement Via Individualized Determination.  Through this program, our 
students are provided strategies and techniques that support organization and study habits.  Along with these necessary tools
 
for college 
prepar
ation, they have also had guest speakers come and share their education and career experience. Our students in the Dual 
Immersion Program (ALAS)  become bilingual and bi
-
literate through rich curriculum and culturally relevant practices and at the end of 
8
th grade are eligible to get the Seal of Biliteracy from our local High School.  In the STEM Specialty, students are exposed 
to the Cycle of 
Engineering and intense exposure to the Scientific Method through hands
-
on, rigorous, cross
-
curricular experiences 
that challenge them 
to work collaboratively in groups. Our students have access to technology through our computer lab, five mobile Chrome Book l
abs and 
three mobile iPad labs. We provide additional academic support to our students through intervention and
 
English Language Development 
(ELD) classes and after school interventions.  Through project
-
based learning, students tackle a challenging academic curriculum in ways 
that are engaging, meaningful, and adaptable to a variety of learning styles. Our curricu
lum is tied to the Common Core State Standards. 
Report Cards are provided to parents three times a year.  Student assessment data is gathered every year using standardized t
est results, 
benchmark assessments and writing prompt assessments.
 
 
After School
 
We
 
have the Mount Pleasant After School (MPAS) program that serves approximately two hundred students from dismissal to 6 p.m. i
n 
grades kindergarten to eight grade. This program provides a homework club, physical activities, enrichment and a sports progr
am.
  
Students are able to participate in After School Sports (6
-
8th grades), Math Olympiad Club, Tech Challenge, Student Leadership, and a 
school musical.
 
 
Intervention Support
 
We identify students at
-
risk through our assessment process and facilitate Student
 
Success Team (SST) meetings with students' parents, 
classroom teacher, intervention teacher, our counselor, principal and psychologist. We determine what the student needs with 
input 
from all stake
-
holders and create a plan to help the student succeed. Ou
r intervention teacher works with our students in need of extra 
support and after a given time of support, we meet again to see the outcome of our plan.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Ida Jew Academy Charter School houses 575 students. Its 25 classrooms are wired 
for internet use and equipped with document cameras, projectors and 
personal speakers for multimedia purposes. We have 3 iPad carts that have been distributed to each classroom so every teacher
 
has at least 2 iPads in 
their room at all times.  We also have
 
three mobile carts with 30 ipads each that teachers are able to check out on a daily basis.  Facilities are clean and 
well kept. The school has a beautifully landscaped campus and newly adopted quad area with surrounding primary and early elem
entary class
rooms. 
Facilities are maintained according to the district maintenance and operations procedures. Ida Jew Academy invested time and 
energy in landscaping 
and remodeling classrooms equipped with updated teaching walls, new sinks, flooring, and up to date WI
FI access. Our office facility, staff lounge, 
conference room, innovation center, and upcoming science lab are new additions to our campus.  In addition to the district pr
ovided updates, Ida Jew 
Academy received the Synopsys grant which provided: Mural Des
ign, Blacktop improvements, benches, and basic landscaping needs.  Our quad area 
houses two water hydration stations for students and staff.  Students are not only able to refill their water bottles, they a
re also able to track data and 
use it in their mat
h and science activities. We are currently working on making further updates to provide students the highest quality educatio
nal 
experience with a 21st century approach.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to 
the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education po
pulation and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are
 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

however, the number of students tested is not 
the number that was used to calculate the achievement level p

year.  Parents also participate in the After School Sports Program, the school
-
wide Musical, and the Tech Challenge.  Many parents attend the monthly 
"Coffee with the Principal" meetings hosted by Mr. Rod
riguez.  These are great platforms for becoming informed about upcoming events and great 
opportunities to ask questions, voice concerns, and hear from other parents and families.

Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Ida Jew Academy  continues to strive to provide a safe and engaging learning environment for all students and their families 
. We are putting various 
preventive efforts in place to improve school climate. Some of the activities include recognizing students
 
for good attendance, academic and citizenship 
throughout the year. We are in our sixth year implementing a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support Program referred t
o as (PBIS) Building 
Effective Schools Together (BEST) .
 
 
IJA follows tenants of Pea
ce Builders. We have also incorporated BEST practices (PBIS
-
 
Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports), and focus on 
three overall expectations (Be Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be Safe). Our School provides a safe and engaging learning env
ironment
. We have various 
preventive efforts such as activities that focus on improving our school climate. Students are recognized for monthly perfect
 
attendance (VIPs), 
demonstrating Peace Builder/BEST principles, and academic success throughout the year.
 
 
We al
so implement the BEST (PBIS) behavior system. A team of administrators, classified and certificated staff make up our BEST te
am.   The BEST team 
continues to present key ideas to the Leadership Team and the staff. Our district continues to receive ongoing 
training in the Best Behavior Program, a 
positive behavior program that provides intervention techniques based on research in school discipline. The program addresses
 
school
-
wide, common 
areas, classroom, and individual student intervention. Our staff has 
worked together to define school
-
wide expectations
-
 
be respectful, be responsible 
and be safe. Together we have agreed upon common language to use and have directly taught our students what these expectation
s are and what they 
look like for all areas of th
e school.
 
 
We have after school programs to provide additional supervision and support for our students. The Mt. Pleasant After
-
school Program (MPAS) enrolls 
approximately 200 students. This program provides a learning lounge for homework/study opportuniti
es, enrichment activities, and sports programs.   
Our students in grades 6
-
8th may also participate in the After School Sports League.  Ida Jew Academy and August Boeger Sports teams serve all 6
-
8th 
grade students interested in playing middle school sports
.
 
 
Ida Jew Academy provides a safe and engaging learning environment for all of our students. The district installed a 180 degre
e camera to monitor our 
campus. We have two custodians who help to make sure our school is a clean and safe learning environment
 
for our students. All visitors are required 
to enter the building through the front door, sign in and wear a visitor's pass. The site works closely with the San Jose Saf
e School Campus coalition and 
community based organizations to assist with school and 
community issues.
 
 
A "No bullying" policy is strictly adhered to and students who violate the policy are given a harassment advisory. Continued 
problems in this area may 
result in a meeting with parents, the school psychologist, referral for counseling, su
spension, or expulsion from school.   We also have counselors on site 
to help with bullying prevention and to improve our students social skills.  We have an Anti
-
Bullying week and assembly to bring awareness to our 
students regarding our bullying policy. 
We have San Jose Safe School Campus do Anti
-
Bullying presentations for all of our students.
 
 
Parents are informed of school activities, parent meetings, important dates, academic requirements, and rules via newsletters
, school
-
wide phone blasts, 
postings o
n the school web site, postings on face book, student handbook, parent handbook and district policy handbook. Our office is a
lways open to 
parents who have questions, and we encourage parents to request meetings with their child's teachers. Announcements a
re done on a weekly basis 
where student council is responsible for creating and deploying the information to students.  Within these messages, student 
council representatives 
also make sure they reinforce BEST practices and expectations.
 
 
We also provide s
mall group intervention support and homework support after school using categorical funds. We have counseling services provid
ed by 
a district counselor and additional providers. In addition we offer Preventative Early Intervention classes for at risk famil
ies sponsored by the Alum Rock 
Counseling Center and funded through Mental Health funding.
