Our
 
school
 
recognizes
 
parents
 
as
 
valuable
 
partners
 
in
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
our
 
students.
 
We
 
strongly
 
encourage
 
parents
 
to
 
visit
 
their
 
child's
 
classroom
 
and
 
meet
 
with
 
their
 
child's
 
teacher.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
required
 
parent
 
conference
 
in
 
the
 
fall
 
at
 
which
 
time
 
teachers
 
meet
 
with
 
parents
 
to
 
establish
 
and
 
review
 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
year,
 
discuss
 
academic
 
progress,
 
and
 
take
 
up
 
any
 
other
 
pertinent
 
topics.
  
Parent
 
attendance
 
at
 
these
 
meetings
 
is
 
critical.
 
We
 
also
 
give
 
teachers
 
and
 
parents
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
request
 
a
 
conference
 
to
 
touch
 
base
 
in
 
the
 
early
 
spring.

School
 
Safety
 
Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Staff
 
and
 
parents
 
on
 
the
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
have
 
worked
 
together
 
to
 
update
 
the
 
Safe
 
Schools
 
Plan,
 
most
 
recently
 
in
 
January
 
2019
 
(with
 
another
 
update
 
scheduled
 
for
 
January
 
2020).
  
The
 
plan
 
includes
 
specific
 
concerns
 
and
 
recommended
 
actions
 
in
 
the
 
areas
 
of
 
personal
 
characteristics
 
of
 
staff
 
and
 
students,
 
the
 
school's
 
physical
 
environment,
 
the
 
school's
 
social
 
environment,
 
and
 
the
 
school's
 
culture.
 
 
Emergency
 
preparedness
 
has
 
been
 
an
 
emphasis.
  
Fire
 
drills
 
are
 
held
 
monthly,
 
earthquake
 
drills
 
are
 
held
 
quarterly,
 
a
 
campus
 
evacuation
 
drill
 
is
 
held
 
annually,
 
and
 
a
 
campus
 
lockdown
 
drill
 
is
 
held
 
annually.
  
The
 
district
 
holds
 
a
 
school
 
bus
 
emergency
 
drill
 
each
 
year.
  
The
 
school
 
is
 
fortunate
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
Santa
 
Barbara
 
County
 
Fire
 
Department
 
substation
 
just
 
down
 
Centennial
 
Street
 
from
 
the
 
campus.
 
 
Campus
 
safety
 
has
 
been
 
improved
 
by
 
the
 
addition
 
of
 
perimeter
 
fencing
 
and
 
gates
 
funded
 
by
 
Measure
 
G,
 
a
 
school
 
bond
 
measure
 
approved
 
by
 
Orcutt
 
Union
 
School
 
District
 
voters
 
in
 
November
 
2016.
  
The
 
fencing
 
and
 
gates
 
enable
 
the
 
campus
 
to
 
be
 
secured
 
during
 
the
 
school
 
day.
