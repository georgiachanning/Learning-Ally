School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional 
through proper facilities 
maintenance and campus supervision. Ongoing maintenance and campus improvements ensure facilities remain up to 
date and provide adequate space for students and staff. District maintenance and site custodial staff ensure that the 
r
epairs necessary to keep the school in good condition are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used by 
school and district staff to communicate non
-
routine maintenance requests. Emergency repairs are given the highest 
priority. Classrooms 
and other school facilities were modernized in 2009. Solar Ready replacement lunch court structures 
installed in 2017.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil 
Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balan
ced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students
 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage
 
of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
At Cajon Park School, i
t is our philosophy that education is a shared responsibility with parents. We recognize that parental 
involvement is necessary to the overall quality of the educational program for all students. Parents play an integral role in
 
their child's learning and 
are encouraged to become actively involved in their child's education at school.
 
 
The Parent Involvement Policy is available for all parents to review. It will be updated annually by the School Site Council 
and will be incorporated into the Cajon Park Pare
nt Handbook which is posted on the school's website.
 
 
Parents are provided with ongoing information about curriculum, assessments, and students' proficiency levels. That 
information is shared through Back
-
to
-
School Nights, parent/teacher conferences, newsl
etters, and teacher and school 
websites.
 
 
All students are expected to work toward attainment of grade level standards and to demonstrate positive character 
attributes. Interventions are provided for students who require additional support in order to achi
eve their highest 
potential. Teachers and staff work closely with parents to communicate academic performance and acknowledge positive 
decision making through progress reports, written notes, e
-
mails, phone calls, and recognition assemblies.
 
 
Ongoing commu
nication about school programs is promoted through conferences, weekly newsletters, teacher and 
school websites. Parents are offered numerous opportunities to become involved with the school and their child's 
education. Opportunities include: serving as a 
classroom volunteer; participating in parent groups, chaperoning field trips, 
assisting with PTSA activities, serving as an art docent, volunteering in the garden, or serving as a room parent.
 
 
There are also opportunities for parents to serve on decision
-
making and advisory committees or councils, such as the 
PTSA Board, School Site Council, English Learner Advisory Committee, or serving as a parent representative on a district 
advisory council.
 
 
The Cajon Park staff is committed to promoting active parent
al involvement as we believe that a strong connection, 
between school and home, promotes an optimum opportunity for students to attain success and to achieve to their 
highest potential.

All training and curriculum development activities at Cajon Park School support the implementation of Common Core 
Content Standards and State curricular frameworks. Decisions concerning selection of staff development activities are 
performed by the princip
al, district administrators, and grade level representatives using tools such as teacher input, 
district benchmark results, data analysis, and focus groups to determine the areas in which additional teacher training 
may enhance classroom instruction and in
crease student achievement levels. Cajon Park School offers support to new and 
veteran teachers through peer coaching and mentoring. All staff are encouraged to attend professional workshops and 
conferences. Classified support staff receive job related tra
ining from department supervisors and district representatives.
 
 
Most above indicated days are partial days as the trainings take place after school hours, or for partial day releases to 
allow more access to the specific trainings. 45/86 days this calendar
 
year are full day trainings, including school
-
wide 
trainings offered before the start of the school year.
 
 
Specifically for the 19/20 school year, additional professional development hours have been dedicated to the 
implementation of the UDL template.
