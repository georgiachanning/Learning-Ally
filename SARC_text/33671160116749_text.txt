By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability
 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accoun
tability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the 
SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the
 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the s
chool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

implemented Positive Behavior Intervention and Support (PBIS), as well as the School Site Council (SSC) and SSE Leadership 
teams. We continue to develop our Student Counci
l membership, as well as we have created a MakerSpace lab for our 

goals are to increase school spirit, teach students important leader
ship skills, and provide services to our surrounding 
community. The PBIS, SSC, Student Council, and Leadership teams continue to provide ongoing updates and data that 
promote a positive school climate and safe school. The following vision and mission of So
uthshore Elementary is a beacon 
that guides this professional practice:

the school in good repair is completed in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure services and emergency 
repairs are given high priority. A complete
 
and thorough facility inspection is done annually to identify future areas to 
address and prioritize facility needs.
 
 
In accordance with Ed. Code Section 17070.75 (e), the district uses a facility inspection system to ensure each of its school

students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully
 
completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs

inclusion in classroom activities. We welcome parents on our campus for a variety of school and family events.  A few 
examples of those are Back to School Night Mo

Lunch with A Loved One, school performances, Open House, and our spring carnival. We have over 150 parent volunteers 
who assist and support in the classrooms, on field trips, in PTA d
uring family event nights, and in many other capacities 
around our campus. We believe in providing parents and families with regular communication through our school website, 
Remind, and School Messenger.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each Menifee Union School site completes a Comprehensive School Safety Plan (CSSP), including a disaster preparedness 
plan annually. A copy
 
of the SSE Comprehensive School Safety Plan is available for review at the school office. The plan 
includes emergency procedures for natural disasters and campus intruders. Students, teachers, and staff are trained to 
prepare for a wide range of emergenci
es, and frequent drills help to refine emergency skills, policies, and procedures at 
all school sites. Also, following each drill, specific and intentional feedback is sought from all participants to improve 
emergency procedures continually, and therefore 
enhance campus safety.
 
 
SSE staff exercises strict adherence to the district adopted safety/site security protocols, which include a leveled/colored 

-
in usin
g our Raptor 
system. SSE Comprehensive Safety Plan is reviewed annually; the entire staff participates in monthly emergency drills and 
provides feedback.
 
 
Finally, school and district administrators immediately investigate threats of harm. Teachers and adm
inistrators seek to 
foster lines of open communication, so students and parents feel comfortable reporting inappropriate activity, including 
bullying, harassment, or threats. All SSE staff take a strong stand against threatening behavior or bullying and in
vestigate 
complaint matters thoroughly.
 
 
Our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system teaches and reinforces appropriate student behaviors. 
We foster social
-
emotional learning (SEL) skills development in the form of weekly lessons deliv
ered school
-
wide to all 
students, supported by curriculum from SecondStep.org. The curriculum establishes high expectations for achievement 
by all students in every subject area, and students are supported by counseling services that include crisis counsel
ing, peer 
counseling, and intervention programs.

As a school district, we are focused on increasing academic achievement in English 
Language Arts and Mathematics along 
with increasing school attendance.   To this end, our professional development strategy is geared to increase student 
engagement through the implementation of our district
-
adopted curriculum and the type of interventions
 
we have in 
place.  Site and district leadership teams review achievement data on state and local assessments to make determinations 
on staff development and training, to be aligned with yearly goals and projected activities.
 
 
MUSD provides two full days o
f professional development along with additional days as needed per site and data.  
Additionally, the major areas of focus have been on the adopted curriculum and intervention. State and local achievement 
data are used to make determinations. This district
 
provides two full days of professional development along with 
additional days as needed per site and data. Additional days are provided before, during, and after school by either 
directors, coordinators, or intervention specialists. Additionally, conferen
ces, workshops, Grade Level PLC, and staff 
meetings are some ways of providing on
-
going professional growth. Many teachers and administrators continue to take 
college
-
level courses to enhance their teaching or administrative skills.
