School Description
 
Bardin Elementary School, home of the "Chieftains" is located at 425 Bardin Road in the city of 
Salinas.  Our school serves approximately 640 students in grades transitional kindergarten through 
sixth grade.  The One Way Developmental Bilingual program exi
sts at grades kinder through sixth.  
We have a special education day class serving General Academics, which support children in grades 
fourth through sixth.  We at Bardin Elementary believe that ALL students are capable learners who 
have the right to a hig
h quality education, provided by qualified, passionate educators who 
embrace diversity within both the presentation of educational curriculum and the students 
themselves. Here at Bardin, we promote and build connections that integrate students, families, 
d
istrict and local/global communities.
 
 
Much of the work completed at Bardin has been developed through our partnership with the 
Monterey County Office of Education via our Professional Learning Network (PLN). Our leadership 
team works together to identify 
areas of weakness in our practice and highlight the best practices 
that are positively influencing our students outcomes. Through this work we have developed our 
Problem of Practice and school wide implementation classroom read alouds that are strategicall
y 
geared to exposing our students to texts, while addressing their comprehension and writing levels. 
In addition, all students in grade K
-
6 participated in 30 minutes of at
-
level intervention where 
students were strategically divided by ability and provide
d with targeted instruction to bridge the 
learning gap.
 
 
The instructional program is comprehensive in all curricular areas based on common core state 
standards and district guidelines.  Teachers meet on a regular basis to align program content, 
pacing, an
d student progress through the Grade Level Team (GLT) release model. Our instructional 
program is supported by Accelerated Reader, LexiaCore5, Lexia PowerUP,  Achieve3000, and our 
bilingual classrooms in grades K
-
2 use I
-
Station. In addition, children in g
rades kindergarten through 
sixth grade  participate in the 1:1 technology program.  Instructional practices include multiple 
opportunities for technology
-
based learning projects, in Kinder to second grade students utilize 
SeeSaw as their digital portfolio,
 
while students in third through sixth utilize Google Classroom.  The 
goal is to provide children with the opportunity to learn using the latest educational applications, 
which support the curriculum.
 
 
This is the tenth complete year of our after school pr
ogram. The program offers our students 
academic and enrichment activities, including structured tutoring and homework assistance, 
reading/language arts, English language development, and math. The enrichment activities include 
music; drum and Ukulele lesso
ns, as well as gardening.  The Reading program includes Lexia, Reads 
Naturally, and Reading A
-
Z, depending on the child's needs.  Math programs include Triumphs, and 
Rewards.  The school offers extracurricular activities such as soccer, basketball, volleyb
all, and flag 
football.
 
 
Bardin Elementary school has a strong partnership of staff, students, parent, and community 
through monthly meetings. The encouragement and participation in school activities supports the 
idea that every child can learn and every c
hild will.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the 
condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet
 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the
 
California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.
