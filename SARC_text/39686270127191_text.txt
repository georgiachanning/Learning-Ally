School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Parents are an extremely important part of California Virtual Academy @ San Joaquin. Parents will help us to evaluate the 

f California Virtual 

previous school. Some parents will also serve as mentors to new families and families that are struggling with technolo
gy 
complications or curriculum problems. The mentors support and encourage families in learning to navigate the day
-
to
-
day management of home education. Parents are given an opportunity to make their voices heard (both online and offline) 
and provide their
 
opinions on the direction of the school. Some parents will be asked to give critiques and/or testimonials 
about the program.
 
 

by re
searching our program and choosing to enroll their child in our school. Parents attend a registration conference and 
agree to the enrollment requirements.  By completing these steps, parents show they are committed to being an active 
member of their studen
t's education team in our program.
 
 
Parental involvement is enhanced by the fact that the school will be educating not only students, but also its parents. 
Parents will be trained on the K12 instructional system, and taught how to be effective learning coa
ches under the 
guidance of highly qualified and certificated teachers. Many parents will learn how to use computers for the first time, 
become expert e
-
mail and Internet users and will be exposed to a content
-
rich curriculum, including classic literature, 
a 
comprehensive re
-
telling of the story of history, various musical genres, and great works of art.  Parents will have a rich 
social networking experience with the school Facebook site.  We have many resources available both online and offline. 
There are o
ngoing Parent/Learning Coach training opportunities through the FAST orientations and support sessions, 
teacher
-
led Learning Coach workshops and curriculum specialist series for advanced learners as well as those students 
enrolled in the Mark12 reading pro
gram.   We have a very detailed Parent
-
Student handbook, Special Education handbook 
and CAVA strong start resources on our website.  Families are offered outings and may find pertinent information on 
campus websites.
 
 
Our school will accomplish parental in

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The California Virtual Academy takes staff and student health and safety very seriously. Because the school will be a virtual
 
school, there will be no need for a school building where classes are held on a daily basis. The administrative office 
currently c
omplies with all ADA, OSHA, and local health and safety requirements. The school has obtained all necessary 
permits for these offices including a building and fire marshal inspection and/or a certificate of occupancy.
 
 
Immunization forms and other pertinen
t medical records will be kept (confidentially) on file by the school administration. 
Parents are expected to ensure that their children obtain proper immunizations prior to matriculating pursuant to Chapter 
1 (commencing with §120325) of Part 2 of Divisio
n 105 of the Health and Safety Code. The school may exempt students 
from enrolling who are not properly immunized pursuant to §48216 (a
-
c) of the Education Code. Those parents who are 
having difficulty obtaining immunizations for their children will be pro
vided information on where to get immunized in 
their community.
 
 
All pertinent and required health and safety documentation is collected at time of hire or enrollment as appropriate. 

d in security at the Simi Valley, CA office. Copies 
of employee records and student records can be made available at the request of the School District.
 
 
The school has drafted health and safety procedures that the school will follow to ensure the health a
nd safety of pupils 
shall which include compliance with the criminal background check requirements described in Sections 44237 and 45125.1 
of the Education Code.
