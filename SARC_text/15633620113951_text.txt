By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Old River Elementary is one of the district's best elementary schools, We were established in 2007. The school's name was 
derived from our local area place name and bord
ering street name. The School Accountability Report Card was established 
by Proposition 98, an initiative passed by California voters in November 1988.  The Report Card, to be issued annually by 
local school boards for each elementary and secondary school 
in the state, provides for parents and other interested 
people a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes, and the areas in which improvements are 
needed.
 
 
Old River Elementary is a learning community that strives to live out t
he Panama
-
Buena Vista Union School District motto 

campus. Students are not only supported and expected to do their best in their stud
ies but are also held accountable to 
treat each other with respect. We were named a California Distinguished School in 2010.
 
 
The Old River learning community is around 1000 people, big and small, working together.. Located in a growing and 
vibrant part of
 
our city, we are committed to providing  solid service to our families. We understand that the best way to 
educate children and manage change is for parents, staff and our students to work together. We are excited about 
becoming a PBIS and AVID school in 
2018. Our Purpose Statement for the 18

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Old River Elementary enjoys the continual inspection and repair by  professional site and district 
maintenance teams. Our 
staff and students also demonstrate an on going interest in keeping our school in clean and working order to facilitate 
learning and promote safety. Old River provides a safe and clean environment for learning. A scheduled maintenanc
e 
program is administered by the District to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are maintained to a degree of adequacy 
that provides for good learning. Ongoing repairs and modifications to the physical plant exceed California Building and 
Safety Cod
es.Thanks to our district maintenance department for completing a sidewalk resurfacing project In October, 

last FIT review was April 5th,
2017. The exterior grounds are well lit and the perimeter of the school facility is fenced for 
student protection and safety. A team of custodians ensures classrooms and campus grounds are kept clean and safe. The 
restrooms are cleaned, sanitized and secur
ed at the end of each school day with 100% of the toilets in operating condition. 
A solar array was completed in August, 2016 to provide electrical energy to our facility. Lighting was upgraded to highly 
efficient/low energy use bright LG lamps. As outline
d in our Safe Schools Plan, the safety committee has addressed 
concerns for the safe coming and going of our students. Staff receive in
-
service in emergency protocol and CPR. Identifying 
tags are issued to substitute teachers, volunteers, and other visitor
s as they register using the Raptor System in our office. 
The gates on the perimeter of the school playground are locked during school hours and staff members are trained to 
activate lock out or lock down procedures in the event of an emergency. Our positi
ve partnership with local law 
enforcement is evident in their quick response time when concerns arise. Designated staff members carefully supervise 
students on the playground and in the cafeteria. Grounds and playground equipment are inspected regularly fo
r potential 
hazards. The District provides on
-
going training in CPR/First Aid as part of its staff development program. Fire and/or 
disaster drills occur monthly and a complete school site disaster plan has been prepared and is in place and available for 
p
ublic review. Scheduled certificated supervision of students begins officially at 7:50 a.m. when the school opens and 
supervision ends at 3:15 p.m.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] Sy
stem, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight an
d grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cogni
tive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
o
f study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priori
ty: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The parents of Old River Elementary support their children's learning, the school, and the community by helping their 
children with school work, providing a caring home environment, and by attending conferences, programs, athletic, and 
academic events. Opp
ortunities for parental involvement at Old River include the POSSE Parent Club, School Site Council, 
and classroom/intramural volunteers. The Parent Club provides funds to support learning opportunities, playground 
equipment, school events, and many other 
items that further the mission of our school community. Our parents and staff 
are very active though out the year hosting evening events designed to foster community and strengthen families. 
Examples include our Annual Barn Dance, Movies on the Range, Fath
er Daughter Dance, and Family Game Night. Our staff 
and P.O.S.S.E. also partner with Girl Scouts to host events serving those children. In turn, those parents give back to our 
school in the form of several service projects such as campus maintenance and be
autification. Contemporaneous 
information and images of POSSE and other school events/opportunities may be found on Twitter @LuckyWrangler. 
Information may also be found at our POSSE Old River Parent Club FaceBook page. Questions may be directed to this

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Our community does a very good job looking out for one another and regularly practices responses to a variety of 
emergencies. The district also provides an automated calling system that allows staff to communicate safety and event 
information with families
 
proactively and in the event of an emergency. Our 2018
-
19  Comprehensive School Safety Plan 
was last reviewed, discussed and updated with staff and other stakeholders on 08/12/19. The overall intent of our three 
goals: training staff to effectively respon
d to emergencies, continue to improve campus security, and reduce the number 
of student discipline violations, is to ensure a safe and learning focused school. All of our learning community endeavors 
to live by our motto of, "Honest Words, Honest Actions, 
and an Honest Day's Work" by treating other Wranglers the way 
they themselves would want to be treated. Our students see this modeled by our staff and community volunteers and 
respond in kind.  Our implementation of PBIS and a taught school purpose stateme
nt of "Do Right." is having an positive 
overall impact on school focus and safety.
