By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Redwood Elementary School provides a safe, clean 
environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The school is situated 
on 12.3 acres. School facilities were built in 1946, with additions built in 1999 and 2004. They span more than 75,500 
square feet and include a cafeteria, library, and classrooms. Imp
rovements to school grounds included the renovation of 
student restrooms, the playground area, and volleyball/basketball court. Other improvements at Redwood Elementary 
School included the building of three new classroom facilities. In September of 2006, f
our new kindergarten classrooms 
opened. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 
The District has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the 
district. A summary of these standards is available at the 
school office or at the district office. The site administration team works with the custodial staff to develop cleaning 
schedules to ensure a clean and safe school. A team of five full
-
time custod
ians ensures classrooms, restrooms, and 
campus grounds are kept clean and safe on a daily basis. A scheduled maintenance program is administered by the District 
to ensure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained and provide a suitable learnin
g environment.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 
Safety concerns are the number one priority of Maintenance and Operations Department. District maintenance 
supervisors and site administrators are proactive and conduct inspections at school sites on a continual basis
. Repairs 
necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a timely manner. A work order process is 
used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. The district maintenance staff 
has
 
indicated that 100% of all toilets on school grounds are in working order.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district contributes to the deferred maintenance fund (Fund 14) to cover annual maintenance costs that occur 
throughout the year or replacement of 
existing school building components. Typically, this includes roofing, plumbing, 
heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor systems.  These maintenance costs are 
typically for major repairs.

Redwood Elementary 
believes in the importance of parent and community involvement as an integral part of student 
success. The presence of parents and community members are very much present at Redwood in clubs, committees, 
volunteer opportunities, events, and celebrations. N
umerous programs and activities are enriched by the generous 
contributions made by the following organizations:
 

 
Kiwanis Club
 

 
Rotary Club
 

 
School Site Council
 

 
ELAC
 

 
College Community Services
 

 
Healthy Start
 

 
Richland's Parent Outreach Center
 

 
Parent/Community Vo
lunteers
 

 
City of Shafter
 
At Redwood, parents/community members donate time/items as service to our students on a continuous basis. 
Volunteers offer a huge array of resource and supports for the school community, while showing our students the 
importance of
 
community participation on a larger scale. We also invite and recognize parents/community at our special 
celebrations which include assemblies and student celebrations and events. At Redwood, we know the importance of 
parent/community Involvement in the l
ives and education of our students. When schools, families, and community groups 
work together to support learning, children tend to do better in school, stay in school longer, and like school more."

become volunteers may contact school principal at (661) 746

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Redwood Elementary School.  All visitors must check in at the school 
office with a valid ID using the Raptor 
screening system.  Visitors are then assigned a badge with their identification photo 
and name printed on it.  The office is the only entrance to the school once the school day has begun (single point of entry 
excluding arrival and dismissal time).
 
 
The sc
hool is in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake 

Fire drills are co
nducted on a monthly basis and earthquake drills are held once a school year. Bus evacuation safety drills 
are also conducted once during the school year. Safety kits are placed throughout school facilities to provide proper 
supplies during an emergency si
tuation. Monitoring of school grounds is performed by assigned staff members before, 
during, and after school.
 
 
A Comprehensive Safety Plan was developed by the school, in consultation with local law enforcement, in order to comply 
with Senate Bill 187 of 
1997. The plan provides students and staff a means to ensure a safe and orderly learning 
environment. Components of the Comprehensive Safety Plan include child abuse reporting procedures, teacher 
notification of dangerous pupil procedures, disaster respons
e procedures, which include lockdown procedures, 
procedures for safe ingress and egress from school, sexual harassment policy, and dress code policy.
 
 
Redwood Elementary School reviews and updates the plan annually. The plan was last approved on February 4
, 2019 for 
the 2019
-
2020 school year. The plan is reviewed with school staff at the beginning of each school year. An updated copy 
of the plan is available to the public at the school office or the District Office.
