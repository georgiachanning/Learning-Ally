By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

views K
-
8 textbooks and other 
instructional materials and then adopts those meeting specific quality standards. In the Los Alamitos Unified School

ors. The 
most promising programs are piloted using established criteria and guidelines. The recommended books are then 
approved by the Los Alamitos Unified School District Board of Education. To receive State instructional funds, the Los 
Alamitos Unified S
chool District ensures that it has fully complied with the requirements of Education Code Section 60119. 
The District has also conducted an annual public hearing ensuring the sufficiency of instructional materials. Each school 
maintains a library/media cen

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
 
The Los Alamitos Unified School District has always emphasized the importance of a clean, safe environment for learning. 
The environment of each 
campus is a matter of pride for students, staff and parents. Several schools have planted 
individual gardens, organized workrooms, and planned workdays for students and parents to enhance the facility. To 
insure that our facilities are in good repair condi
tion, custodians at each site perform monthly inspections and the District 
maintenance crew places safety as the number one priority. Rossmoor Elementary was built in 1959.
 
Overall the school is 
in good condition. It is clean and well maintained. Voters wi
thin the District boundaries approved a local bond in 2008. 
Due to the passage of the Measure K Bond in 2008, all school sites within the District were modernized. The modernization 
work included the installation of new roofs, electrical, HVAC, plumbing, f
ire alarm and data systems. The doors, windows 
and flooring were replaced along with all new restroom fixtures. The modernization of Rossmoor Elementary School was 
completed in September of 2012.
 
 
Additional information about the condition of the school's 
facilities may be obtained 
by speaking with the school site principal.

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs
 
of study.

The Rossmoor School staff is fortunate to have a strong and supportive
 
parent and larger community that assists and 
supports with the instruction of quality education for our students. There are multiple
 
opportunities
 
for parents to be 
involved. Hundreds o
f parents and community volunteers assist the staff in supporting learning
 
for all students. Volunteers 
support the front office, work in the classrooms, participate on field trips, tutor individual students, organize and 
participate in assemblies,
 
work in
 
the media center, volunteer on the playground, organize fundraisers and so much more. 
Our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and Friends of Rossmoor fundraising group are involved with providing significant 
instructional support and financial support for th
e
 
student curriculum and learning programs.Both PTA and Friends of 
Rossmoor support ongoing technology advances in the classroom as well as exposure to science
 
and
 
art
 
enrichment 
activities.
 
Rossmoor has long term relationships with small businesses in Los
 
Alamitos and Seal Beach. Parents can, and 
do continually work with us to identify new businesses and other sources of support for Rossmoor. For more information 
about opportunities for parent involvement at Rossmoor, community members are encouraged to co
ntact our school 
office and visit our website at www.losal.org/rossmoor. The Los Alamitos USD Educational Foundation (LAEF) is a 
community
-
based, non

profit organization which was formed in 1985. It consists of
 
supportive community members 
working together
 
to raise money to maintain and improve the quality of the schools of the Los Alamitos Unified School 
District. The Foundation has a commitment of fundraising for STEAM initiatives. Contact LAEF at
