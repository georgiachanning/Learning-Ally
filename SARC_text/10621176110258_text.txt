District Mission Statement
 
To be a quality educational system providing the resources for all students to reach their potential 
in mind, body and spirit.
 
 
District Vision Statement
 

 
 

 
The School Accountability Report Card (SARC), issued annually by local school boards for each 
public elementary and secondary school in the s
tate, provides parents and other interested people 
with a variety of information about the school, its resources, its successes and the areas in which 
improvements are needed. As you read this SARC for Garfield Elementary School, I believe you will 
find th
e educational philosophy of the Garfield staff is based on the concept that character and 
high expectations shape the development of the whole child. Positive character, a standards
-
based 
curriculum, high accountability and school safety are emphasized. In
 
2019, Garfield was recognized 
as a Gold Level PBIS Model School. Garfield has received the Clovis Unified CLASSI Award every year 
since 2001. In 2019, 79 percent of our students met or exceeded the standard in English language 
arts (ELA) and 78 percent of
 
our students met or exceeded the standard in mathematics as 
measured by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC). We appreciate all of the hard 
work of the students, staff, parents and community members at Garfield.
 
 
During the 2018
-
2019 school y
ear, Garfield focused on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS), 
2nd Step social
-
emotional learning curriculum, and professional development around our school 
site initiatives. During 2019
-
20, Garfield will continue working on MTSS as well as focus on Read
y 

Mystery Science, Accelerated Reader, and teacher grants to support classroom needs.
 
 
Art is alive and well at Garfield. Mr. Jonathan Davies runs a high
-
qua
lity Art Docent program for all 
of our students. All students in grades 5 and 6 have the opportunity to participate in band, choir or 
orchestra, and students in grade 4 have the opportunity to participate in introduction to choir and 
instrumental music pro
grams. We also pride ourselves on school service. The Garfield Student 
Council, Human Relations Council, and classrooms reach out to the community with many 
wonderful service projects, such as sock and toiletry donations to the Marjaree Mason Center, 
donat
ions to the Valley Animal Center, Pennies for Patients, donations to the American Heart 
Association, and service to Orchard Park residents. I hope as you read the SARC, you will get a clear 
picture of all of the truly amazing things happening in Cub Countr
y! You may request any additional 
information regarding the SARC by calling the school office at (559) 327

Sincerely,
 
Mrs. Jennifer Bump

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Garfield, now in its 26th year, provides a safe, clean learning environment for all students. A full
-
time plant supervisor and two evening custodians 
perform the daily cleaning operations in each class
room, the Library Media Center (LMC), administration building and the Cub  Café. Deep cleaning is 
conducted twice a year. The Garfield SART committee conducts eight clean
-
campus inspections each year. This committee of parents inspects the campus 
grounds a
nd restrooms on a regular basis to provide feedback to our school. Garfield continuously strives to improve student responsib
ility and provide 
community support by keeping the campus safe and clean. When asked to grade how well the buildings and grounds ar



community awareness, school pride and an open
-
campus policy, graffiti, vandalism a
nd burglary are kept to an all
-
time low.
 
 
The playground area provides basketball courts, playground equipment, and an open field area for various recess and physical 
education activities. The 
Garfield Special Education Center and the staff provide special
ized services and therapy to medically fragile children in Clovis Unified School District.
 
 
Philosophically, the district believes schools are the hub of their neighborhoods. As a result, a high priority is placed on 
building and maintaining excellent 
faci
lities as economically as possible.

education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible
 
students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

feature in the Comprehensive School Safety Plan and the School Crisis Plan.
 
 
Garfield staff members supervise students before, during and after school hours to ensure student safety. Special drills are 
conducted at the Special 
Education Center for medically fragile students. All plans have been created in collaboration with Alta Si
erra Intermediate,  Buchanan High School, the 
CUSD Police Services department and Clovis Fire Department. Safety is our top priority for the Cubs, Bruins and Bears who all
 
share the Buchanan 
Education Center.
 
 
Garfield participates in the yearly Great Cali
fornia ShakeOut, which is an earthquake
-
preparation plan. More than 10 million people participated this 
year. We can never be too safe with our Garfield Cubs!

Types of Services Funded
 

 
On an annual basis, Clovis Unified School District (CUSD) submits the Application for Funding Consolidated Application and Re
porting System for 
Categorical Aid Programs commonly called CARS. The application is submitted in two (2) parts:  Part I, which con
tains program and demographic 
information, is submitted by June 1 each year; and Part II, which contains the budget information and additional program data
, is submitted by January 
31 each year.  The categorical programs included in the application are Tit
le I, Part A 

 
Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged 
Improving, Title I, Part C 

 
Migrant Education, Title II, Part A 

 
Preparing, Training and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals, and Title III 

 
Language Instruction for Limi
ted English Proficient and Immigrant Students.  Essentially, these funds are designed to assist students in mastering state 
standards.
 
 
Clovis Unified Schools are committed to establishing a true partnership with all facets of the Clovis Learning Community
.  CUSD values feedback and 
input.  Parents continue to make positive differences in the lives of the children we all support.  We know from research tha

education will not only bring success to your child but other children 
in the school.  Our parents truly make a difference in the lives of Clovis kids!
 
 
CUSD is pleased and proud to offer a variety of parent involvement opportunities that improve our overall program.  Depending
 
on the type of categorical 
funding a site may re
ceive, district or school parent councils and committees are required under certain requirements and guidelines.  Such adviso
ry 
committees in the CUSD include:
 

 
School Site Council (SSC)
 

 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC)
 

 
District Advisory Committee 
(DAC) and School Advisory Committee (SAC)

School Plan
 

programs/services that are designed to support student achievement of each and every s
tudent.  Parental involvement is a necessary and vital part of 
developing the SPSA as well as our overall program.  At the district level, parent committees provide input into each of the 

Local Education Agency Plan (LEAP)

school.  The Principal, Learning Director, or Guidance Instructional Specialist (GIS) would be happy to assist you, or go: to
 
http://
www.cusd.com/supplementalservices.
 
 
Listed below are several parent committees that assist with categorical programs and funding.
 
School Site Council (SSC):  All schools receiving categorical funds are required to form a SSC.  The SSC is composed of paren
t
s, students at the secondary 
level and school personnel.  It is responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating the 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement programs. Members 
serve for two years and are elected by their peers.
 
 
District Advisory Committ
ee (DAC) & School Advisory Committee (SAC):  The entirety of the SSC acts as the SAC. The SAC serves as an advisory committee
 
for the purpose of advising schools regarding supplemental education programs and acting as a liaison for their school commun
ity. 
They serve to share 
information and comments both at the district and site level.  These education programs are supplemental education opportunit
ies that provide services 
to students who are disadvantaged, English learners, foster youth and/or at
-
risk.  Th
e SSC has approved to designate our SSC pursuant to California 
Education Code (EC) Section 52852 to function as the School Advisory Committee.
 
 
English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC):  All schools enrolling 21 or more English learners are 
required to form an ELAC. The ELAC is composed of 
parents and school personnel. The ELAC provides input and makes recommendations to the principal, staff and SSC regarding ser
vices for English learners 
and conducts an annual survey.  Members serve for two 
years.
 
 
District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC):  Whenever there are 51 or more EL students in the district, there shall 
be a functioning District 
English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC).  It is important that each school site ELAC elect a D
ELAC representative and arrange to have that 
representative attend every DELAC meeting.  Currently the DELAC bylaws require each DELAC representative to be 1) a parent/gu
ardian of an EL or 
former EL (i.e., a reclassified fluent English proficient student) 
currently enrolled at the site he/she represents, and 2) elected to serve as the DELAC 

 
 
District Indian Education Parent Advisory Committee (IPAC):  The CUSD Native American Indian Education Parent Advisory Commit
tee meet
s four times 
a year to discuss program issues, services provided, and other needs related to the student achievement of our students, comm
unity agencies and 
outreach programs. CUSD Indian Education Program addresses the needs of American Indian and Alaskan
 
Native students in grades K 
-
 
12. The program 
assists eligible students to achieve at the same challenging state performance standards expected of all students in grades p
re
-
K 
-
12.
 
 
Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) Forums:  CUSD develops an LCAP a
nnually that works to better align the academic plan with the district 
expenditure plan that is approved by our CUSD Governing Board each June. Parents and other stakeholder groups are invited to 
participate in the 
development of the LCAP through participa
tion of school and district committee meetings and community forums.  LCAP School, District Meetings and 
Community Forums are exciting opportunities for all stakeholders and school committees to engage with the District and share 
their ideas on how CUSD 
ca
n provide quality opportunities and support for CUSD youth and schools. Community participation and feedback in the forums wi


 
 
These forums are designed to provide an opportunit

provide input and feedback on future plans and opportunities. Sites also have an opportunity to work together in teams to sha
re new ideas to support 
identifi
ed groups and to plan for site engagement and implementation.
 
 
The following is an overview of the categorical funding and programs in CUSD.  These funds are further discussed and outlined
 

at the committee meetings.
 
 
Rationale
 
Gen

ics, not reflective of the 
general school population, that affect their success in the base/core programs.  Some come from economic
ally disadvantaged homes; some are 
educationally disadvantaged or lack English language proficiency because they have a primary language other than English.  Ch
ildren, such as those 
described above, require supplemental services and materials not generally
 
provided through the base/core curriculum program.  The needs of our 
children are identified and supplemental services and materials are planned and targeted to meet their special needs.  Catego
rical funds are to be used 
to provide the financial support t
o meet these special needs.
 
 
Philosophy
 
All CUSD schools offer students with special needs the same kinds of high quality
 
learning opportunities and access to the core curriculum in all curricular 
areas.  Categorical funds are designed to support additional assistance to help students succeed in the regular classroom pro
gram (base/core curriculum) 
and address any learning ga
ps. The focus is on the effective utilization of supplementary materials, personnel, and staff development.   Staff developme
nt 
activities are used to improve instructional practices and strategies to increase the ability of teachers and other staff to 
cha
llenge and assist all students 
to reach their fullest potential.
