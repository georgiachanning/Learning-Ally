By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
SCHOOL FACILITIES AND SAFETY
 
Mesquite Trails Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and 
campus 
supervision. Original facilities were built in 1998; ongoing maintenance and modernization efforts ensure facilities 
remain safe and up to date and provide adequate space for students and staff. Throughout the years, portable classrooms 
have been added to 
accommodate increased growth in enrollment. The campus is comprised of the following:
 
Acreage = 10.6
 
Square Footage = 56,966
 
Number of permanent classrooms = 21
 
Number of portable classrooms = 20
 
Number of restrooms (student use) = 5 sets
 
Computer Lab = 0 
(Chromebook Carts and Tablet Carts 
-
 
Available for Classrooms)
 
Library = 1
 
Cafeteria= 1
 
Music Room = 1 (included in portable classroom count)
 
Health Office = 1
 
Staff Work Room/Lounge = 1
 
 
CAMPUS SUPERVISION
 
Seven proctors, strategically placed in various a
reas of the campus, supervise students as they enter school grounds. Seven 
proctors provide supervision during the lunch recess; two proctors are stationed in the cafeteria and 3
-
5 supervise 
playground activities depending upon the time of day. At the end 
of the day, teachers, classified staff, and school 
administrators monitor designated areas to ensure students leave campus in a safe and orderly manner.
 
 
CAMPUS MAINTENANCE
 
The custodial staff and district's maintenance department work together to ensure p
laygrounds, classrooms, and campus 
grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. The administrators and 
custodians communicate regularly regarding maintenance issues and special projects; hand
-
held walkie talk
ies facilitate 
an efficient communication system and an immediate response to emergency situations. Once a month, the 
administrators meet with the custodians and school office staff to discuss routines, upcoming events, and departmental 
needs.
 
 
One full
-
ti
me day custodian and two full
-
time evening custodians are assigned to Mesquite Trails Elementary and work 
closely with the assistant principal, Mr. Ponce, for routine maintenance, daily custodial duties, and special events. Every 
morning before school begi
ns, the day custodian inspects facilities, ground areas, and school's perimeter for safety hazards 
and other conditions that need attention prior to students and staff entering school grounds. The evening custodians clean 
classrooms, desks, restrooms, scho
ol office and whiteboards, and are responsible for set up and take down of equipment 
and/or furniture for after
-
school meetings and evening events.
 
 
Mesquite Trails Elementary works closely with the district's Maintenance and Operations department (M&O) fo
r larger 
projects, routine facilities maintenance projects, and school inspections. M&O employs a work order process that enables 
Mesquite Trails Elementary to communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. 
Emergency situat
ions are regularly resolved in one hour or less.

All professional development activities in Hesperia Unified School District revolve around academic and social and 
emotional needs of students.
 
 
The Certificated staff builds 
teaching skills and concepts through participation in ongoing training and site PLC 
collaboration days sponsored by the district and school site.  Each school site identifies and coordinates its own staff 
development activities based upon individual studen
t needs, school site plans, and the districts designated focus areas. 
Supplemental training involving curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies in the content areas of 
reading/language arts and math were provided at site request via Coordinator of
 
Staff Development and Academic 
Coaches.
 
 
Supplemental training topics were selected by the principal, assistant principal, leadership team, SLT team and Staff. 
Training programs and topics were chosen based upon the school focus and student needs. Results
 
from i
-
ready, SBAC, 
common formative assessments, teacher feedback, and findings from classroom observations help identify areas for 
improvement and training programs that will enable teachers to deliver a challenging and rigorous standards
-
based 
educatio
n fostering student success and proficiency.
 
 
The district supplements site
-
level professional development to follow up and support year
-
round and ongoing programs 
centered on the district's focus areas of reading and math. Supplemental professional develo
pment is sometimes offered 
throughout the school year, on early student release days, during summer vacation, and on weekends. Staff development 
topics and focus areas are identified and selected based upon input from the district's Professional Developmen
t 
Committee, Principals' Roundtable, and teacher survey results. The Principals' Roundtable provides opportunities for 
school principals to discuss and share training needs based upon data analysis and classroom observations from each 
school site.
 
 
New tea
chers receive intensive support and training through the district's Induction Program and New Teachers Academy. 
For beginning and out
-
of
-
state teachers, the district utilized the state Induction Program (formerly known as Beginning 
Teacher Support and Asse
ssment), a statewide and state
-
mandated research
-
based program providing support and skill 
building through formative assessment and individualized support based on assessment. The New Teachers Academy 
sponsors three new teacher orientations each year to s
upport year
-
round hiring practices; the orientation is a 
comprehensive overview of the district's policies, school law, English language learners support, curriculum, instruction, 
and grade
-
level and content area specialties.
