By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Year and month in which data were collected:
 
August 2019
 
 
Core K
-
6 textbooks adopted by the San Bernardino City Unified School District Board of Education are selected from the 
State adopted list of materials. Transitional 

These materials are standards
-
based and are rigorously reviewed by San Bernardino City Unified School District textbook 
adoption committees to assure that selections will meet the u
nique needs of all learners, including English language 
learners, advanced learners, at
-
risk students and special needs students.  Textbooks are usually adopted for an eight
-
year 
cycle.
 
 
All core curriculum materials are available in English and Spanish.  
The Board of Education ensures that standards
-
aligned 
textbooks and/or instructional materials are purchased for each student to use in class and at home. Instructional 
materials include a variation of textbooks and/or consumables, big books and supplement
al materials determined by the 
district to cover required state standards. English Language Development (ELD) materials are standards
-
aligned and are 
purchased for each student who is identified as an English learner.  An inventory is completed for each cl
assroom at every 
school site and is reported to the District Office to ensure that sufficient materials are available for the new school year.
  
This inventory is completed in March/April of each year to prepare for the following school year.
 
 
The district 
is phasing in a new science adoption, the previously adopted, state framework aligned, textbooks will remain 
in use until the new adopted books are implemented at district schools. The new Science adoption is beginning in 2019 
and will be in use August of 
2020.
 
 


progra
m is voluntary and open to students in grades four through six.  Sufficient instructional materials are available for

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
General
 
Henry Elementary School opened in fall of 2013.  The school has 14 classrooms, a media center, multi
-
purpose room, and 
an administration office. The facility strongly supports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground 
spac
e, and a staff resource room. The school also has professional office space for support staff (i.e., speech therapist, 
psychologist, etc.).
 
 
The district takes great effort to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional.  To assist in this effo

Mobile Maintenance Teams use the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT), a survey instrument developed by the State of California 

and 
Operations Department. The most recent inspection took place on 1/11/19. Below is more specific information on the 
condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are provided with an appropriate learning 
environment.
 
 
Safety
 
To en
sure student safety before, during and after the school day, rec aides, teachers, and administrators supervise the 
school grounds including the cafeteria, quad area, and athletic fields.  Signs are posted throughout the campus to indicate 
all visitors must
 
report to and register in the administration office.  All staff and visitors wear appropriate identifying 
badges.
 
 
Maintenance and Repair
 

a

 
each site reports safety issues as they arise.  Maintenance and Operations make necessary repairs to ensure that all 
schools are c
lean, safe, and functional.  A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and emergency repairs 
are given the highest priority and work orders are completed in a timely manner.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule
 

tions department works with the site principal or designee to develop cleaning runs 
for the site custodian(s). The site principal/designee then works with the site custodian(s) to ensure proper 
implementation of the cleaning runs to maintain a safe and cle
an school.
 
 
School Facility Improvements
 
Each year the district uses state and local funds to maintain and improve school sites.  Planned improvements for this 
school for the 2019
-
20 school year are listed below.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., 
California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/
literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California St
ate University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Every student and teacher has the right to attend a school free from physical and psychological harm. To help s
chools 
achieve these vital goals, the State of California has mandated that each K
-
12 school develop a comprehensive school 

local pub
lic safety agencies, community leaders, parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, and other persons interested 

preparedness, mitigation and prev
ention, response and recovery.
 
 
In close cooperation with the California Schools Risk Management (Joint
-
Powers Authority), local police and fire 

istrict 
sites and provides correction reports to site administrators.  A follow
-
up system is in place to ensure timely compliance 
and correction of discrepancies.
 
 
School sites also conduct scheduled drills for anticipated emergency situations (such as fi
res, earthquakes and lockdowns) 
to prepare students, staff, and other stakeholders how to appropriately respond to those emergencies. The district follows 

ement 
System (NIMS) for emergency management.  The Office of Safety and Emergency Management is also tasked with 
coordinating the response and recovery of emergencies or other disasters affecting the SBCUSD.

The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1, 2018, regarding how to calculate school
-
level per

pupil expenditures that will be 
reported on 2018
-
19 report cards.
 
 
Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 
2018
-

The common goal of all categorically funded programs in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) is to 
ensure that all students
--
including English learners, educationally disadvantaged pupils, African American, Hispanic English 
o
nly, gifted and talented pupils, and pupils with exceptional needs
--
attain mastery of state and local standards.
 
 
The educational program at each site is based on an improvement planning process that includes members of the school 
community such as the pri
ncipal, teachers, support staff, parents, and students (at the secondary level). These 
stakeholders form the School Site Council (SSC). The SSC develops and annually monitors, evaluates and revises a plan 
called the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPS
A). The SPSA, based on self
-
study and collaboration, ensures that all 
of the resources available to the school are coordinated and focused on providing a high
-
quality educational program in 
which all students can achieve success.
 
 
Some students have diffic
ulty mastering academic state and local content standards. They may be at risk of not meeting 
graduation requirements. For these students, categorical program funds are provided. Categorical funds are supplemental 
educational dollars used for supports that
 
augment the core instructional program and increase the academic success of 
these students. Categorical funds provide items such as additional personnel time, staff development opportunities, 
supplemental student materials, and other specialized services,
 
equipment, and supplies.
 
 
Categorical programs commonly found at SBCUSD sites are:
 

 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Title I, Part A
 

 
Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
 
 
Additionally, categorical programs have been established at the district level to pr
ovide important services and 
instructional support that help increase student success. Categorical funds in this category support District efforts in the 
areas of:
 

 
Vocational Education Basic Grant Award (Voc Ed) 

 
Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Educa
tion Improvement 
Act of 2006
 

 
ESSA Title II, Part A 

 
Supporting Effective Instruction
 

 
ESSA Title III, Part A 

 
Language Instruction for English Learners (EL) and Language Instruction for Immigrant 
Students
 
 
Continuous Improvement
 
LEAs are encouraged to use
 
evidence
-
based interventions that are reasonable, necessary, and consistent with Title I, Part 
A of the ESSA, to improve student achievement for those students not meeting grade level standards. At the local level, 
SBCUSD identifies schools with greatest 
needs, based on a variety of data, including local and state student progress 
indicators, to provide additional resources and services to the schools (referred to as Targeted Support for School Progress 
or TSSP). Additionally, the California Dashboard is u
sed to identify schools and student groups in need of Comprehensive 
Support and Improvement (CSI), Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI), and Additional Targeted Support and 
Improvement (ATSI).
