Principal's Message
 
 


student both the opportunity and expectation of meeting state sta
ndards in all core curricular 
areas. Teachers set an example for students as lifelong learners through their continuing 
participation in advanced coursework, such as the California History and Math Projects, a STEM 
grant, Learning Improvement Science, PBIS
, and Montessori training, which in turn enhances 
instruction in the classroom.
 
 
Shasta Elementary School offers a student centered education based on the philosophy and 
methods of Maria Montessori.  Students are supported and challenged to discover their 
strengths, 
to be critical thinkers, life
-
long learners, and contributing members of the community. Expectations 
for student behavior are high, yet individualized. We provide support for students who need an 
extra emphasis on learning social skills. Our gre
atest strength is our family
-
type atmosphere, which 
promotes a close knit, community feel. The result is a productive, vibrant learning environment in 
which students can thrive both academically and socially.
 
 
Shasta Elementary has attained the status of a
ffiliate school with the prestigious Gilder Lehrman 
Institute of American History. As the oldest continually operating public school in the state of 

opportu
nities to further explore both our state and national histories through exclusive access to a 
diverse array of multimedia materials provided by the Gilder Lehrman Institute. Learning from the 
past to pave the way to a bright and productive future for our s
tudents remains a strong focus for 
the school.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Ava

-
20)
 
Shasta Elementary School provides instruction using the Montessori method.  Therefore, in support of our teaching/learning st
yle, our main curriculum 
is a wide variety of Montessori m
aterials.  The materials we use are aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), and we expect our teachers to 
be consistently focused on these standards.  We are currently in the process of developing written documentation of the align
ment of our Mo
ntessori 
materials with the CCSS.
 
 
We do supplement our Montessori materials with traditional textbooks.  The textbooks we use are chosen from lists that have b
een approved by State 
Education officials.  The textbooks are consistent with the content and cy
cles of the curriculum frameworks adopted by the State Board of Education.
 
 
The District has affirmed that all pupils, including English Learners, have adequate, appropriate materials to use in class a
nd supplemental materials to 
take home when needed.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Our school includes eight buildings, of which five are portables. Together they can accommodate approximately 1,012 people. O
n an average day, 175 
students and staff occupy these buildings, ta
king up 17 percent of our capacity. We keep our campus clean and well maintained. The original building 
dates from 1957 and underwent modernization in 1997. We have expanded our gymnasium to accommodate full
-
court basketball.  Our outdoor athletic 
field, a
 

ding re
-
roofed in 2017. 
In August 2018 the Carr fire burned right up to the school inflicting damage to the site. Since the damage
 
occurred we have been able to restore the 
buildings, playgrounds, and landscaping around the school including new playground equipment for all children.
 
 
Routine repairs are usually modest in scale and do not include modernization projects, renovations, o
r other construction normally paid for by bond 
measures or grant funding. We have a wonderful library. Students use the library during regularly scheduled, weekly visits an
d on an as
-
needed basis for 
research.  We have a part
-
time library paraprofessional,
 
who is on site four days a week.
 
 
We have about 35 computers available for K
-
3 student use, which means that, on average, there is one computer for every two students. We have one
-
to
-
one Chromebooks for students in fourth through eighth grade.  There are 
13 classrooms connected to the Internet. Students use computers at all 
grade levels. We have 20 iPads for student use.  We have wireless internet access throughout the whole school and a new phone
 
system upgrade 
scheduled for 2019. SMART Boards are used in
 
our classrooms and one is also available for our after school program.

A full

at night or early morning. The 
Principal, along with the maintenance staff, works with the custodians to develop cleaning schedules to ensure clean and 

ddition, o
n a monthly basis, the 
lead custodian uses a facility survey instrument developed by the Northern California Schools Insurance to evaluate the condi
tions of the school's facility. 
These reports are sent to the District Facilities Department who then does a

[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students

State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent involvement is the heart and soul of Shasta Union Elementary. Parents are involved in 
the Parent Teacher Association (PTA), school fundraisers, 
and volunteering in the classrooms and library.  We have many family oriented events.  Some of these events are our ice cream
 
social, harvest festival, 
winter craft night, annual spring performance,
 
and family BBQ lunch . Research indicates that when parents are involved, children are better able to 
realize the importance of their education.

School Safety Plan
 
Our School
 
Safety Plan is coordinated with the overall plan for the Redding School District New Millennium Partnership.  Emergency infor
mation has 
been developed for the school along with maps and protocols for emergency situations. The key elements addressed in our
 
School Safety Plan are in 
regards to the campus grounds, school buildings, security, and emergency procedures. Each staff member has a radio to communi
cate with each other 
and the office.  Regular fire, earthquake and lock down drills provide students the
 
opportunity to practice procedures in case a real crisis occurs. We have 
a zero
-
tolerance policy on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Shasta Elementary School is a closed campus. All visitors are required
 
to check in at the 
office upon arrival on campus.

The School Safety Plan was last reviewed, updated, and discussed with the school faculty and site council in December, 2019.
