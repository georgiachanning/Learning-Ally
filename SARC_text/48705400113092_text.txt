Plan
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
The
 
Fairfield-Suisun
 
Unified
 
School
 
District
 
requires
 
safety
 
plans
 
for
 
each
 
school:
 
BP/AR
 
0450,
 
Comprehensive
 
Safety
 
Plan;
 
BP3515,
 
Campus
 
Security;
 
BP/AR
 
3515.2,
 
Disruptions;
 
and
 
BP/AR
 
3516,
 
Disaster
 
Regulations.
 
The
 
Governing
 
Board
 
insists
 
that
 
students
 
and
 
staff
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
secure
 
campus
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
free
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
psychological
 
harm.
 
The
 
Board
 
is
 
fully
 
committed
 
to
 
maximizing
 
school
 
safety
 
and
 
to
 
creating
 
a
 
positive
 
learning
 
environment
 
that
 
teaches
 
violence
 
prevention
 
and
 
emphasizes
 
high
 
expectations
 
for
 
student
 
achievement,
 
responsible
 
behavior
 
and
 
respect
 
for
 
others.
 
Each
 
school
 
site
 
develops
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
school
 
wide
 
safety
 
plan
 
that
 
includes
 
violence
 
prevention
 
strategies
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
a
 
crisis.
 
Each
 
plan
 
is
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
specific
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
Each
 
school
 
plan
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
expertise,
 
available
 
resources
 
and
 
building
 
design,
 
along
 
with
 
factors
 
unique
 
to
 
each
 
site.
 
A
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
plan
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
school.
 
The
 
plan
 
is
 
updated
 
and
 
reviewed
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
each
 
school
 
year
 
by
 
the
 
principal
 
with
 
the
 
complete
 
faculty.
 
School
 
Safety

include
 
the
 
following
 
elements:
 
a
 
positive
 
school
 
climate
 
promoting
 
respect
 
for
 
diversity,
 
personal
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
effective
 
interpersonal
 
and
 
communication
 
skills,
 
anger
 
management
 
and
 
conflict
 
resolution;
 
disciplinary
 
policies
 
and
 
procedures;
 
prevention
 
of
 
and
 
alternatives
 
to
 
violence;
 
parent
 
involvement
 
strategies;
 
prevention
 
and
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
sale
 
or
 
use
 
of
 
alcohol
 
and
 
drugs;
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
school's
 
physical
 
environment
 
and
 
development
 
of
 
ground
 
security;
 
school-site
 
crisis
 
intervention
 
strategies;
 
staff
 
training
 
in
