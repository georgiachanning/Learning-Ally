School Description
 
 
Message From Principal
 
Welcome to the 2019
-
2020 school year!  This is our seventh year serving students in the Brentwood 
Union School District. This year, our staff is working on four main goals: 1.) Continue to refine good 
first instruction of the California Common Core standar
ds in order to deepen student conceptual 
understanding; 2.) Continue to support students who are not at grade level and challenge those 
who are at grade level and beyond ; 3.) Continue with integrating technology into all subjects; 4.) 
Increase awareness a
mong school community about conflict resolution lessons, anti
-
bullying 
information, positive action assemblies and communication with families.
 
 
To date we now have close to 712 TK through Fifth Grade students. We are proud of the fact that 
we have increas
ed access to chrome books and other forms of technology, especially for students 
in Grades 3 to 5.  There are different ways for students to get involved with programs such as 
Service Club, Conflict Managers and band for Fifth Graders.
 
 
One way to stay con
nected with the latest information at MCB is through our website.  There, you 
will find a copy of our monthly newsletters, calendar of events and other announcements.  You can 
find our website at: http://mcb

you to become

announcements regarding district wide events, school board meetings and information about our 
State Standards.

About the SARC
 
B
y February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contro
l Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

20)
 
Brentwood Union Elementary held a public hearing 
on Sept. 11, 2019, and determined that each school within the district had sufficient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of Californ
ia. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classroom 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed b
y the California Department of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are reviewed by a
ll teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee com
posed of teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption. The table displays information collected in Sept. 
11, 2019 about the quality,

School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of the Brentwood Union School District.  The district and schools are in co
mpliance with all laws, rule
s, 
and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last review
ed and updated 3/1/2019 
by the School Safety Committee. All revisions were communicated to the both the classified and certifica

plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster. Fire and disaster drills are conducted on a regu
lar basis throughout the school 
year.  Lockdown and Lockout drills are held twice a 
year. Students are supervised before and after school and during lunch by certificated and classified 
staff and the principal. Parent volunteers help with supervision during lunch and break periods. There is a designated area f
or student drop off and pick 
up. All visitors are required to check in at the office upon arrival and before departing from the school campus.  Visitor ba
dges are issued at the time of 
check
-
in and are to be worn throughout the visit.  All visitors are scanned by our Raptor Visitor sy
stem.
 
 
Discipline & Climate for Learning
 

: All student will have a safe 
school culture, climate and learning environment in 
order to support student physical, mental and emotional health.  All sites have implemented best 
practices for character education, bullying prevention, diversity appreciation programs, and social media education.  In addi
tion, students in the 
Brentwood Un
ion Elementary School District are guided by specific rules and classroom expectations that promote respect, cooperation, cou
rtesy and 
acceptance of others. Parents and students are informed of school rules and discipline policies through the (Parent/Stude
