By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Dear Parents and Families:
 
 
Welcome to Kingsley, the Conservatory of Music! Our mission is to provide all students with the keys to success which we 
accomplish through a robust core instructional program with exciting opportunities in music
 
provided by our own full time 
music teacher and dedicated general education teachers. All students in kindergarten through grade six receive thirty 
minutes of general music weekly with opportunities in choir, strings, brass, and woodwinds for all upper gr
ade students. 
Kingsley Lions also showcase their talents in annual performances such as our Winter Concert and Spring Concert. We 
believe that music increases academic achievement, allows students to express themselves in ways that meet their social 
and em
otional needs, and brings people together.
 
 
As a PBIS school, all members of the Kingsley community are taught to be respectful, treating others the way we want to 
be treated; responsible, doing the right thing even when no one is watching; and compassiona
te, what hurts my 
brother/sister hurts me.
 
 
In the upcoming year, we will be focusing on improving student scores in language arts and math as we continue to build 
our Music Conservatory, and we acknowledge that students succeed when teachers, students and
 
families work together. 

everyone works together to achieve that which would be impossible alone.
 
 
We invite you, our school community, to join u
s as we create a masterpiece
-
 
successful children.
 
 
With anticipation,
 
Melaine Troesh, Principal
 
 
 
Kingsley Elementary is located in the city of Montclair in the southwest corner of the Ontario
-
Montclair School District. 
Operating on a traditional calendar, Kingsley currently serves approximately 660 students in grades Pre
-
K through 6th 
grade. Since we 
reside on the border of two cities, our Kingsley population draws primarily from the city of Montclair with 
a small percentage of families living in Ontario.
 
 
This school year marks the fifth school year for Kingsley Elementary as a Music Conservatory. All
 
students in grades PK
-
6 
are provided with weekly music instruction from a fully credentialed music teacher who is an integral part of our school 
site staff. In addition, upper
-
grade students may elect to participate in specialty ensembles which rehearse w
eekly 
including chorus, beginning band, advanced band, beginning strings, advanced strings, guitar, drums, and with most recent 
additions of ukulele and piano groups. Thanks to the support of our school board, members of cabinet, staff, parents, 
students, 
and community members, Kingsley was awarded both the California Gold Ribbon and a Title 1 Academic 
Achievement Award four years ago. W e eagerly anticipate providing even more opportunities for our community to have 
their lives enriched through the gift of
 
music as our program expands through the coming years.

Our teachers and support staff work diligently to provide a rigorous core curriculum, while at the same time embracing 
Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports. Because Kingsley Lions learn the im

own work and actions, demonstrating compassion for all living things, and maintaining the utmost respect for others and 
our environment; Kingsley has been continuously awarded the PBIS Gold and Silver Awards reco
gnition. Being respectful, 
compassionate, and responsible is the Kingsley way!

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Kingsley School was originally built in 1954 for 450 students, though it has grown over the years and currently is serving 
approximately 660 students from preschool through sixth grade. Kingsley has a total of 20 permanent classrooms, 14 
portable classroom
s installed at various times over the past decade, a Library, a Learning Center, an administration 
building, a teacher workroom and office space for support staff. The former kitchen has been converted into a 
parent/teacher resource center. The school has 
a large field and plenty of playground equipment for student recreation. 
There are 13 restrooms available for students and staff, all of which are in working condition.
 
 
The school facility offers an exceptional learning environment with fully functioning 
lighting, heating and cooling systems 
and noise negation. Internet access, including wireless, is available in the office and all classrooms. Each classroom has 
student computers, a printer and a teaching technology station that includes a laptop, document
 
reader, projector, and 
Smart Board. The district Information Services Department maintains a content filter for all Internet traffic, including E

Over the past few years, 
Kingsley has completed facility improvements. During the summer of 2011, all gas lines were 
replaced with new lines throughout the entire school. In the spring of 2015, a new mural was added to an outdoor wall in 
the courtyard area highlighting Kingsley's 
Conservatory of Music and college focus, and additional music murals were 
added to the exterior windows facing the parking lot in the summer of 2015. During the summer of 2016 a new swing set 
was installed on the upper
-
grade playground and new murals depic
ting Kingsley's focus on being "respectful, responsible, 
compassionate" were installed near the courtyard area. During the 2017
-
2018 school year, the outside perimeter of the 
school  was upgraded with fencing reaching 6
-
7 feet.  For the 2018
-
2019 school ye
ar, there were a set of monkey
-
bars 
replaced in the Upper Grade playground along with the resurfacing of the blacktop ground of all playground areas. During 
the Winter of 2020 all of Kingsley's Offices and Classrooms were equipped with State
-
of
-
the
-
Art VoI
P phone system to 
ensure communication between all classrooms and offices and the outside areas of campus.
 
 
Students are supervised immediately before and after school by certificated and classified staff members. All students, 
parents and other visitors e
nter the school through the front gate each morning. At all times, parents and visitors must 
sign
-
in and obtain a visitor pass to be on campus. District employees and substitutes all wear district
-
issued identification 
badges. In order better protect all s
tudents, staff, visitors, and all personnel, Kingsley proudly uses the Raptor system 
where all visitors must show a valid, government
-
issued identification.  Students are checked out only through the main 
office.
 
 
Kingsley School is maintained in a manner 
that assures it is in good repair and functional. The administrators work with 
the three site custodians to ensure a daily cleaning schedule is followed that maintains clean, safe & orderly classrooms, 
restrooms, and the school grounds, and that the floors
, walls, and plumbing and electrical systems are all in good repair. 
Site and district maintenance and grounds staff make sure that the work necessary to keep the school in good repair, in 
working order and aesthetically pleasing, are completed in a timely
 
manner. A work order process is used to ensure 
efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest priority. To assist in this effort, the district Operation
s 
Department annually conducts an in
-
depth evaluation of each school to determine t
he condition of the facilities and 
identify situations that need maintenance, repair or upgrading. The district uses a facility survey instrument (FIT) 
developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction to assist with the data gather
ing during the 
inspections. All findings are shared with the school administration and work orders for needed repairs are created at that 
time. The results of this survey are available at the school office or the district office.
 
 
In addition, the last sta
te inspection mandated under the Williams Settlement was completed during a visit on August 20, 
2019. The visit was described as a positive, professional experience with a focus by the entire staff on seeking to improve 
the learning of each student. The re
port was forwarded to the Superintendent of Schools. Any areas of concern noted by 
the team are in the process of correction. Any school deficiencies noted by the team are listed below .

B. Pupil 
Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, 
which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grad
e eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive d
isabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of stud

-
wide emergency response plan. 

School Plan and Emergen
cy Handbook has always been an integral part of the school. The plan includes emergency bell 
signals, fire drills, earthquake procedures, lock
-
down procedures, bomb threats, and examples for coping with any crisis 
that may arise. In October 2019 Kingsley p
racticed an earthquake drill as part of The Great Shake

Out and a 
VIPER/Intruder/Lockdown drill in September 2019. Kingsley's most recent changed to the Safety Plan include strategies 
and goals to make Kingsley's walking areas, bus zones, drop

Kingsley School provides an educational environment where students, staff, and community members will 
effectively 
communicate in a manner that is respectful to all cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.
 
 
Kingsley School has a plan in place to ensure the safety and security of all stakeholders during an emergency situation. 
Kingsley joined the first cohort in 201
3
-
2014 and became a PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Support) school 
focusing on providing students and families with clear behavioral expectations which are frequently acknowledged by all 
staff members. We have since then earned the PBIS Silver R
ecognition 2018 and PBIS Gold Recognition 2017 and 2019 
due to Kingsley's focus on being "Respectful, Responsible and Compassionate" which is clearly communicated to students 
at the beginning of each school year with a kick
-
off assembly and explicit teachi
ng of expectations by all staff members. 
Kingsley staff maintain a 5:1 ratio of five positives per one correction through verbal praise and provision of tickets from 
which student names are regularly drawn by classroom teachers. Students also have the oppo
rtunity to shop Kingsley's 
PBIS store with their earned Lion tickets once a week during lunch recess for small prizes, books, and special experiences.

OMSD has several sustained initiatives, which Kingsley Elementary has embraced, including Thinking Maps, Professional 
Learning Communities(PLC), Write From The Beginning, Eng
lish Learner Support, Kagan Cooperative and Engagement 
Strategies, and Data
-
Driven Instruction. Coaches are trained by the district to provide ongoing support at each site to 
ensure and support high
-
quality implementation in each classroom. At Kingsley Sch
ool ongoing, rigorous staff 
development is an integral part of our school community and is intended to meet the objectives of our 
School Plan
 
for 
School Achievement (SPSA).
 
 
With the arrival of Common Core and revised California ELD standards, the staff ha
s received training in the 
monologic/dialogic talk, Webb's Depth of Knowledge, Designated and Integrated ELD, Close Reading, and Eureka Math. 
During the 2016
-
2017 school year our Coach, Principal, and teacher leader attended a conference titled "The Art of
 
Coaching," and the two site administrators completed a monthly math training for administrators through CSUSB.
 
 
Beginning in the 2015
-
2016 school year and continuing into 2016
-
2017, Kingsley has participated in a district
-
wide practice 
of Instructional Ro
unds. Kingsley's leadership team was trained in and completed internal classroom visits during the 15
-
16 school year to provide data collection to the staff in connection with a school focus on student engagement reaching 
Depth of Knowledge. Kingsley's Lea
dership team used the collected data to inform Professional Development. Rounds 
were also completed later in the 15
-
16 and 16
-
17 school years by visiting teachers and administrators from other sites. 
Kingsley school utilizes our Coach, as well as outside c
onsultants, to continue and develop the implementation of our staff 
development program.
 
 
The following two questions guide our decision making in the planning and implementation of staff development:
 
How are staff development needs determined?
 
How is staf
f development delivered?
 
 
Our staff development needs are determined by student learning outcomes. Based on student assessment data, we have 
designed 2018
-
2019 opportunities for staff members to look critically at instructional strategies that have been proven to 
increase student a
chievement. Once these high yield strategies are identified staff members are given time and training 
to implement these instructional practices into their everyday teaching and lesson design.
 
 
There is weekly time set aside for collaborative, vertical and
 
horizontal, teams. Teachers articulate best practices within 
and across grade levels and plan for the implementation of these high yield strategies during this time. Kingsley staff 
participates in weekly data meeting sessions, and lesson study sessions to
 
enhance their craft in planning and 
implementing the high yield instructional strategies which teacher's have attained through attending professional 
development opportunities such as Eureka Math Prep and Customization, Eureka Module Study, Focus on Fluen
cy, 
Balanced Literacy, Developing the Wonders Adoption. Teachers are supported during implementation through the PLC 
process in which they meet weekly to discuss student performance data. Grade levels are given addition release time for 
grade level plannin
g. Funding is available to offer additional support for supplemental materials needed.
 
 
Kingsley's 2017

2018 6th grade team were pioneers in piloting possible adoptions of the new History

materials. After providing feedback, the 6th grade te
am was fully trained in the newly adopted and approved program. 
During STPT, Structured Teacher Planning Time, the purpose to review data from a specific content area. With the data 

uring the Research portion of our data analysis, 
we use the data sources available, report the facts. Additionally, we look for trends or areas for concern, look for areas of
 
success. This is an objective data discovery.  During the Recall portion of our d
ata analysis, we recall the instructional 
practices that support or hinder our data. Focusing on the prior school year, recall the realities of classroom, school, 
district, program, practice and policies. Moreover, we state facts only and discuss what happ
ened.  During the Reflect 
portion of our data analysis, we connect performance (Research) with prior year practices, programs and policies (Recall). 
Additionally, we consider possible reasons about what occurred last year and how that may have impacted the
 
performance that we observe.  During the Respond portion of our data analysis, we discover what might be some possible 
ways to move forward? These responses tie directly to what was discovered in the reflection process.  The purpose of 
Kagan trainings are
 
to provide staff with researched
-
based instructional strategies that have been proven to increase 

-
 
Over the 
past 3 years, we have adopted many pro
grams that are aligned to our Common Core State Standards. These trainings 
provided to staff supports the implementation of the standards
-
based programs.
