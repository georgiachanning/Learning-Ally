School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-
20
 
 
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC).
 
The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP)
, which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more info
rmation about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see t
he CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or t
he district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

The Irvine Unified School District has an excellent Maintenance and Operations Department that ensures our campus is in 
better than "good" condition.
 
 
Eastwood is in our third year of operation, and our facilities are in excellent condition.  Our 
custodians ensure the campus 
is clean, and pay close attention to any items that need to be repaired.  When identified, these requests are submitted to 
our M&O department, and the problems is addressed quickly.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English languag
e arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Com
mon Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the Califo
rnia State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents have the opportunity to get involved by 
volunteering in their child's classroom and/or joining our Eastwood PTA.  
At the beginning of the school year, teachers elicit parent interest, and all parent volunteers are coordinated directly 
through the teacher.

We encourage parents to join the PTA th
rough a school
-
wide membership drive at the beginning of each year and with 
frequent reminders throughout the year.  General PTA meetings are held 6 times a year, and all parents are encouraged 
to attend and find ways to get involved.  Involvement can incl
ude chairing a program or volunteering to support that 
program.  If parents have any PTA related questions, they can contact our PTA president at: president@eastwoodpta.com
 
 
We host 2
-
3 parent nights annually to address areas of concern that our parents 
bring to us.  This has included our 
homework policy, internet safety, and how Daily 5 works.  We will continue to elicit feedback from parents to determine 
future areas of need.  If parents have a suggestion, they should contact the principal.
 
 
We also hav
e added a 40% English Language Community Liaison.  This position is funded in coordination with our District 
Language Development Department and is intended to provide EL parent with information that helps them navigate 
anything related to Eastwood.  This 
includes academic programs and policies and ways to get involved.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Each year Eastwood reviews our school safety
 
plan with parents, staff, and the Irvine Police Department.  We have clearly 
defined processes for a variety of emergencies including: fire, earthquake, and lockdown.  Our safety play designates 
responsible parties for the different actions needed to prov
ide a safe environment during an emergency with specific 
actions to be taken.  The plan also includes a schedule of the drills we conduct at Eastwood.
 
 
The plan is reviewed with the teachers and staff at a staff meeting in September, and it is reviewed by 
our District Safety 
Supervisor and the Irvine Police Department in October.
 
 
A copy of the plan is available upon request.

previous method of allocating funds to school districts.  In 
place of more than 40 specific funding categories, the new model has established three sources of state funding with 
increased local discretion to determine how best to spend those funds in the s

BASE of per
-

funding.  IUSD has used BASE and SUPPLEMENTAL funding to support the following programs:
 
 
Site 
Programs and Services:  1) Support professional learning and teacher coaching through induction program, content 
TOSAs and teacher mentor program , 2) provide summer school and summer athletic programs, 3) Allocating site funding 
and staffing to support st
udent achievement through support of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) and site PLC 
coaches, 4) Elementary P.E. paraprofessionals, 5) Support for English language learners, 6) Elementary science, music, and 
art programs, 7) Purchase textbooks and ins
tructional materials, 8) Develop a technology rich learning environment 
including; Technology matching programs, Technology Maintenance fund and site technology support staff, 9) Maintain 
previously implemented class
