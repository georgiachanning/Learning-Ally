School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Traver Joint Elementary School Dist
rict provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff and volunteers. The school 
facilities are all up
-
to
-
date and provide adequate space for students and staff. Buildings and grounds are well maintained 
and that sets a stage for a good learning envi
ronment. The maintenance staff cares about the condition of the facilities, 
taking time to perform regular maintenance and to repair in a timely fashion items in need of attention. A deferred 
maintenance program is regularly funded and allows for the neces
sary maintenance and improvement of the district 
facilities. As buildings meet modernization age requirements the district actively gets involved in upgrades.

regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards.   The schools disaster 
preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  Fire, disaster, and lock
-

basis.  Before, during and after school, assigned staff monitors the campus.  Cameras are 
in place to monitor key areas of the school grounds.  All visitors must check in at the front office, wear an identification 
badge while on school grounds, and check 
out upon leaving.  The Comprehensive School Safety Plan is reviewed with the 
school staff at the beginning of each school year.

Professional development within the District addresses the individual needs of the teachers as well as 
broader school 
concerns.  The District has focused on ELA the past two years and just added Math this year.  The District has brought in 
two coaches one for ELA and one for Math to help guide teachers.  The District also offers various workshops, staff 
dev
elopment days, professional conferences and times for collaboration.  These days and sessions are used to provide 
teacher training, to discuss standards and classroom practices, and to implement content standards and guidelines into 
the curriculum.
