a
 
community
 
of
 
compassionate,
 
innovative,
 
life-long
 
learners
 
who
 
continually
 
strive
 
for
 
excellence.
 
Our
 
aim
 
is
 
to
 
promote
 
an
 
academically
 
rigorous
 
curriculum
 
that
 
values
 
the
 
different
 
interests,
 
learning
 
styles,
 
and
 
abilities
 
of
 
each
 
student.
 
JCS-Mountain
 
Oaks
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
teach
 
the
 
California
 
state
 
standards
 
while
 
using
 
differentiated
 
curriculum
 
addressed
 
in
 
the
 
California
 
GATE
 
standards,
 
such
 
as
 
acceleration,
 
novelty,
 
depth
 
and
 
complexity.
 
Through
 
differentiation
 
of
 
the
 
core
 
curriculum,
 
JCS-Mountain
 
Oaks
 
creates
 
opportunities
 
for
 
students
 
to
 
become
 
analytic
 
thinkers,
 
creative
 
producers
 
and
 
practical
 
problem
 
solvers.
 
Lessons
 
emphasize
 
critical
 
thinking
 
skills,
 
inquiry,
 
and
 
connections
 
to
 
universal
 
concepts
 
through
 
cooperative
 
learning
 
experiences
 
and
 
class
 
discussions.
 
A
 
variety
 
of
 
research-based
 
instructional
 
strategies
 
and
 
materials
 
are
 
used
 
throughout
 
the
 
grade
 
levels
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
all
 
students.

Opportunities
 
for
 
Parental
 
Involvement
 
(School
 
Year
 
2019-20)
 
 
Because
 
JCS-Mountain
 
Oaks
 
is
 
an
 
independent
 
study
 
program,
 
parental
 
involvement
 
is
 
welcome
 
and
 
very
 
much
 
needed.
  
We
 
have
 
multiple
 
field
 
trips
 
throughout
 
the
 
year
 
which
 
parents
 
can
 
participate
 
in.
 
Parents
 
are
 
an
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
our
 
School
 
Site
 
Council
 
and
 
Parent
 
Teacher
 
Organization
 
which
 
hold
 
regularly
 
scheduled
 
meetings
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
on
 
our
 
website.
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
additional
 
activities
 
throughout
 
the
 
year,
 
such
 
as
 
Student-Led
 
Conference,
 
Poetry
 
Cafe,
 
Scholarly
 
Presentations,
 
Math
 
Olympics,
 
Family
 
Nights,
 
and
 
many
 
PTO-sponsored
 
events.
 
Other
 
examples
 
of
 
involvement
 
include
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
weekly
 
teaching
 
of
 
their
 
children,
 
Project
 
Week,
 
and
 
opportunities
 
to

on
 
the
