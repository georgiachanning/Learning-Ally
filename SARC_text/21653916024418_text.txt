By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only elig
ible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
T

The Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) and site leadership provide many opportunities for parent participation. Monthly 
PTA Association meetings are hosted at the school for parents to join the discussions and decision making around PTA
-
sponsored school programming. Our very a
ctive PTA sponsors many community building events throughout the school 
year.  Additionally, Edna Maguire has an Inclusion and Diversity Committee, comprised of parents, teachers, and the 
principal, who collaborate on developing school
-
wide learning experi
ences focused on inclusion and diversity in and 
beyond our community. Our Site Council also offers parents the opportunity to participate in school planning and goal 

nts with learning differences and 
their parents. ITAV provides information and resources to understand, identify and teach students who learn differently.
 
 
Parents, community members, and local businesses support local schools through a parcel assessment a
nd contributions 
to Kiddo!, which raises funds to augment a broad range of programs, including visual and performing arts, music, Spanish, 
technology and global studies. A new campus opened in 2014 through community supported bond measures totaling 
$26,300
,000. At the classroom level, parents are frequently invited to join students on field trip excursions, participate in 
special programs, and work with small groups of students in regularly scheduled learning centers. Our art, garden and 
library programs of
fer weekly volunteer opportunities for parents.

As part of the district's professional growth program, opportunities for training and staff development are provided at 
both the district and individual school site level to MVSD 
staff. The district has four staff development days in which 
teachers are offered professional growth opportunities related to curriculum, teaching strategies, and instructional 
methodologies, as well as collaborative planning time. The district places an 
emphasis on teachers learning from and with 
one another through a variety of means, such as teacher
-
facilitated interest based professional development, regular 
collaboration and planning time, and through its Teacher Leader program.
 
 
The district's Instru
ctional Technology Coach and Global Studies Coach lead workshops throughout the school year, and 
provide small

have been on global competence, instructional technology, social
-
emotional wellness, and equity. In addition, the district has provided teachers the opportunity to deepen their 
understanding of teaching for global competence and how to help develop global
ly minded students through global 
education workshops, conferences, and presentations. MVSD has worked closely with EdTechTeacher to support its 
instructional technology initiative. Teachers and staff have enhanced their strategies for addressing social
-
em
otional 
wellness by participating in training on the Toolbox curriculum, as well as by participating in other professional 
development related to social
-
emotional learning. Additionally, over the past three years nearly 175 staff members will 
have particip
ated in Courageous Conversations/Beyond Diversity trainings, which have allowed participants to build their 
racial consciousness and consider different ways to address issues of equity in our schools.
