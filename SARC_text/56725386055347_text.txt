Marina West School is a learning community made up of dedicated teachers and support staff, a 
diverse student population engaged in a variety of learning activities, parent and community 
volunteers, friendly and caring personnel, and an administration comm
itted to a success

Marina West School, we believe all students deserve an education that incorporates a meaning
-
centered, integrated curriculum, requirin
g critical thinking, problem solving and the use of 
educational technology in a safe learning environment. We believe students should be actively 
involved in a respectful, caring, cohesive educational community. Our students have access to 
online education

we move into the 2019

improve student achievement.
 
 
We take pride in ourselves and others. We appreciat
e our differences and similarities and 
acknowledge the things we do well. We recognize diversity as a strength and that it gives us an 
opportunity to learn from each other. The staff always looks for the positive in a situation and uses 
every opportunity t
o nurture the potential in each student. We constantly review STAR360 data 
and review CAASPP and ELPAC assessment data yearly. Marina West will focus on Positive Behavior 
Intervention Supports through the use of CHAMPs and MTSS to meet the needs of the who
le child 
including academics, behavior and social/emotional needs.
 
 
Our focus is on student achievement, with an emphasis on instructional practices and strategies 
which address state standards. We also provide support to students and families to strengthe
n 
their social

of helping each student become successful, productive and responsible citizens. We invite families 

a West community is a team!

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by 
state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are re
quired to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is
 
to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For mo
re information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact th
e school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments

Summat
ive Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English 
language 
arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may parti
cipate in the 
administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Cor
e State Standards 
[CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of stu
dents who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of California and 
the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Marina West School benefits from an extremely active and involved Parent Teacher Association (PTA), which works with the comm
unity through various 
school fundraisers, events, and provides field trips and other enrichm
ent activities for all students.
 
 
Parents are partners in their children's educations. We involve and inform them in a variety of ways. There are several paren
t meetings, such as School 
Site Council, English Learner Advisory Council, Title 1 Meetings, and 
"Coffee with the Principal", during which parents receive information and have input 
into critical decisions. Our website is constantly updated with information that provides parents a connection to events and 
activities on the school 
campus. School newsle
tters and calendars are sent home and posted on the website on a monthly basis. Teachers regularly inform parents of student 
progress through phone calls, conferences and progress reports. Our Outreach Consultant offers support by connecting families
 
with 
necessary services 
to address social
-
emotional needs.  Parent workshops are presented on a variety of topics, including: parenting skills, technology, curricular 
materials 
and assessment. We participate in the Triple P Parenting Program and Padres Lideres 
led parent workshops. This helps parents work with their students 
and develop positive relationships at home, which, in turn, supports success at school. We hold transitional meetings and wor
kshops in order to assist 
parents whose children may be transitio
ning into Kindergarten or to the middle schools. Our school counselor will also provide an informational meeting 
on A
-
G High School requirements.

Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
The safety of students and staff is a primary concern at Marina West School. It is a closed campus, which means that gates ar
e closed and locked and all 

s provided to ensure the safety of each student before 
school, during breaks, at lunch, and after school. Supervision is a responsibility shared among playground aides, teachers, a
nd administrators.
 
 
To safeguard the well
-
being of students and staff, a com
prehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the Safety Committee, which includes 
input by our School Resource Officer. The Safety Plan is updated annually in the fall; all revisions and updates are reviewed
 
immediately with the staff. 
Key elem
ents of the Safety Plan focus on playground supervision, disaster drills, and emergency procedures. The plan was last reviewe
d and adopted on 
January 29, 2019 with the help of the District Support, PBIS Team, Parent input, Teacher input, and School Resourc
e Office input.
 
 
The school is in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake stan
dards. Safety drills are held 
regularly; fire drills are held monthly, and earthquake and lock down drills are hel
d once every trimester.
