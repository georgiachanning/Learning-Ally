About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about 
the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to 
meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see
 
the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of T
extbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
The school district held a public hearing on September 10, 2019 and confirmed that each school within the district had suffic
ient and good quality 
textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab
 
equipment pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including 
English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for use in the classro
om 
and to take home. Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Departme
nt of Education, 
making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State are
 
reviewed by all teachers and a 
recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recommended 
materials are 
available for parent examination at the district office prior to adoption.
 
The table 
displays information collected in September 2019 about the quality, currency, and availability of the standard

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Tierra Vista Elementary School provides a safe, clean environment for students, staff, 
and volunteers. The school is situated on 10 acres. School facilities 
were built in 1965, with additions built in 1999. Facilities span 39,300 square feet, and house two wings of relocatable clas
srooms, and a library/media 
center. The facility strongly sup
ports teaching and learning through its ample classroom and playground space, and a staff resource room. Tierra Vista 
recently expanded the school to contain three additional classrooms. The chart displays the results of the most recent school
 
facilities i
nspection.
 
 
Cleaning Process
 
A team of three full
-
time custodians ensures classrooms, restrooms, and campus grounds are kept clean and safe on a daily basis. A scheduled 
maintenance program is administered by the district to ensure that all classrooms and 
facilities are well
-
maintained and provide a suitable learning 
environment.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget
 
The district participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provides matching funds on a dollar

for

dollar basis, to assist schoo
l 
districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building components. Typically this includes r
oofing, plumbing, heating, 
electrical systems, interior or exterior painting, and floor systems. For the 2018
-
2019 school year, t
he district allocated $500,000 in funds for the deferred 
maintenance program.

Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] 
System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight 
and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cog
nitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or progr
ams of study

School Safety Plan
 
Parents and community members are welcomed to the school. We ask that anyone wishing to be on campus during school hours 
notify staff ahead of 
time. Tierra Vista Elementary School is a closed campus.
 
 
All visitors must sign in at the office and wear identification badges while on school grounds. During lunch, breaks, and bef
ore and after school teachers, 
instructional aides
 
and noon duty assistants monitor the campus to ensure student safety.
 
 
The state requires all schools to develop a School Safety Plan. Components of the School Safety Plan include the following: c
hild abuse reporting 
procedures; teacher notification of da
ngerous pupils procedures; disaster response procedures; procedures for safe entering to, and exiting from, school; 
sexual harassment policy; suspensions and expulsion policies; crime assessment; dress code; and safe schools policy.
 
 
The School Site Safety
 
Plan is updated annually. The plan makes provision for dealing with a wide variety of emergency situations. The plan was desi
gned 
to assist in preparing for emergencies, managing emergency response efforts, and maintaining a safe school environment. The p
lan is updated and 
reviewed with school staff annually in August.
