By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Redwood Elementary has a website which contains all the events and activities, as well as other information regarding 
contacts. The web site is updated regularly and can be accessed at https://sites.google.com/fbusd.us/redwood/home.
 
 
The Redwood Parents Cl
ub is an organization providing activities throughout the year that encourage parents to be 
partners in the educational program, and to develop opportunities for parents and their children to learn together and 
have fun as a family. Examples include the an
nual Fall Harvest Festival, book fairs, Breakfast with Santa, Popcorn Fridays 
and our district
-
wide Color Run. Parents Club funding provides field trips, enrichment activities, assemblies, and 
supplemental instructional materials & classroom supplies.
 
 
Par
ents are actively involved in the classrooms on a regular basis, and support special projects throughout the year. 
Redwood also holds an annual "Family Literacy Night'  Parents and community members serve on our School Site Council, 
which oversees our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement. Parents or community members who wish to participate in 
leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or become a volunteer may contact Redwood Elementary at (707)

Parents participate in our English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), in which parents and community members learn 
more about our students who
se native language is not English. Currently, our families speak English, Spanish, Thai, 
Hungarian and Urdu. English Language Learner parents are offered free English classes near campus through our district 
Adult English classes. A front hallway bulletin 
board focusing on English Language Learners welcomes parents as they 
enter the school and informs them of school events, opportunities, and community resources in Spanish, our second most 
spoken language.
 
 
Parents are invited and come regularly to weekly w
hole
-
school "Friday Morning Openings," at which students are honored 
for being "kind, safe, and responsible".  School songs are sung, and announcements are made.  Monthly, Redwood offers 
an informal question & answer session with administration at "Coffee 
with the Principal". This event is open to the public 
and our parents. In the spring, Redwood offers campus tours and parent orientations, intended to welcome new families 
and provide relevant information. Redwood hosts monthly parent education nights, whe
re families can learn about 
important school
-
related and parenting topics. We offer parents LCAP involvement through board chats, which are held 
prior to every regular board meeting. Any parent or community member interested in becoming a member of the

School Safety Plan (School 
Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The school safety plan was updated and approved by the school board in September 2019. It is available on the school 
website. It includes both the action plan for creating a positive school culture as well as the school emergency response 
p
lan. Redwood Elementary is committed to the safety and security of each student. To that end, a comprehensive plan 
has been developed to address various emergency situations.
 
 
One of our primary concerns as a school is to protect the students in the event 
of a crisis. We have monthly drills that 
adhere to our School Safety Plan. The School Safety Plan is reviewed with staff on a regular basis.  We have ensured that 
every room on our school site is outfitted with the School Safety Plan and an emergency back 
pack that has first aid 
supplies. In addition, we maintain updated records of students and their emergency contacts, as well as up to date records 
of both our school staff and district staff. As a part of our safety plan, we include monthly practice drills
 
for fire, earthquake, 
and/or lock down situations.

This section provides information on the annual number of school days dedicated to staff development for the most recent

year period.
 
 
In the 2017
-
2018 school year, academic curriculum training in both math and English language arts have been conduct
ed 
throughout the year. Technology training continued with repeat attendance at CUE Conference, and increased training 
was implemented in Google software products and district internal data collection systems. A Pro
-
Act (PROfessional 
Assault Crisis Trainin
g) introduction training session continued for new staff members. Prior to school beginning, a new 
teacher boot camp was held as a coaching workshop, which provided establishing support. The Peer Assistance model has 
been implemented for intern teachers to
 
work with an experienced teacher, as an additional support system.
 
 
In the 2018
-
2019 school year, Redwood staff had a focus on literacy improvement. Our staff elected to have a Teacher on 
Special Assignment (TOSA) to help support this direction, with peer
 
coaching, guided reading strategies, individualized 
professional development support, ongoing new teacher weekly support meetings and more. A new teacher bootcamp 
was offered again, for new team members, establishing support in campus culture, teaching me
thods & resources, and 
curriculum setup. Professional trainings were created to be more choice
-
based for staff members, including areas in 
technology, curriculum, social
-
behavior, and teaching strategies. Our school participated in district
-
wide gender 
awa
reness sessions, and have members in our district
-
wide professional development team. Professional development 
training has been extended to our school counselor, psychologist, classroom aides and office staff members by 
participation in outside conference
s and workshops, and sessions with trainers brought to the school.
 
 
In this current 2019

2020 school year, we are focusing on instructional support for teachers as well as continuing 
professional development on PBIS and MTSS. With the ongoing support of ou
r instructional coaches, teachers are provided

reading records, site based 
data analysis, and the creation of lesson objectives.
 
 
On

going early release days training align with Redwood's individual needs, and are developed from staff member survey 
feedback, data analysis and site assessment. We ensur
e that new teachers are provided support through Fort Bragg 
Unified School District's (FBUSD) Teacher Induction Program (formerly known as BTSA), or through our district's peer
-
assistance program.
