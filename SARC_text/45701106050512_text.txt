School Description
 
 
Manzanita School is a Transitional Kindergarten 
-
 
Fifth Grade Elementary  School.  There are 
approximately 100 students at each grade
-
level. The school has a full time principal and an eighty 
percent on
-
site assistant principal.  There are 23 general educa
tion teachers, 2 special education 
teachers, 2 40% certificated music teachers, 1 speech pathologist, 1 school psychologist,  and 24 
classified support staff.
 
 
Manzanita School is a place where a positive, safe learning environment is fundamental, and the 
school community encourages excellence, creativity, curiosity, and respect for others.  Manzanita 
School continues to pursue a focus on computer science immersion by partnering with "Code to 
the Future".   The intent is to create an engaging, interactive, 
and fun learning environment that 
will transition our students from being just players or consumers of technology to creators and 
innovators of it.  Manzanita School offers a comprehensive, state standards aligned curriculum in a 
positive and safe learning
 
environment that strives to engage all staff members in developing 
supportive relationships with students which bridges the connection to the learning process.
 
 
Manzanita School is located in a beautiful, established neighborhood.  Students enjoy a large,
 
park
-
like playground.  The campus is clean and well
-
maintained.  The school is completely fenced and 
security cameras monitor all entry points.  Bell systems, intercoms, phones, and alarms have been 
updated, and are monitored by our IT department.
 
 
Classr
oom teachers meet together weekly as professionals using local and state data to make 
informed decisions about next steps for learning. Our teachers, along with other teachers in the 
District, also meet to develop focus calendars and curriculum pacing guid
es for all subject areas.
 
 
Manzanita has an active and involved parent club.   Our parent club meets monthly and sponsors 
many seasonal family activities that work to engage the entire student body in fun family as well as 
school day events.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We choose our textbooks from lists that have already been approved by state education officials.  We
 
use a district
-
wide adoption process that includes 
teachers, parents, students and administrators.
 
 
We have also reported about our textbooks called for by the Williams legislation of 2004.  We report to the board in Septembe
r and four times a year 
about 
the sufficiency of our textbooks as well as any complaints.  This online report shows whether we had a textbook for each stud
ent in each core 
course during the 2017
-
18 school year and whether those textbooks covered the California Content Standards.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
The Redding School District makes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. In 2016 the Distr
ict and the Board of Trustees 
authorized a Facilities Needs Assessment in order to identify our facilities needs over the next deca
de. To support the assessment effort, in 2018 the 
community passed a $28 million facilities bond to repair, renovate, and modernize all District schools. Since the bond passed
 
in 2018 the District has used 
the Facilities Needs Assessment to plan out the Bo
nd Initiatives.
 
 
In addition to the local bond the District is seeking any State Modernization matching funds on a percentage basis, to assist
 
with the expenditures for 
any major planned modernization work projects.
 
 
The District's Grounds and Maintenance 
staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are completed in a 
timely manner, while the Operations staff ensures that the schools are kept clean. A work order process through a program cal
led "Akita Box" is 
used to 
ensure efficient service; emergency repairs are given the highest priority. In addition to responding to emergency repairs th
e maintenance department 

 
 
Ma
nzanita School is often described as being in a park
-
like setting. The grounds are exceptionally well maintained and beautiful. The school dates from 
1956 and underwent remodeling in 1986. The passage of a $28 million bond
-
funded the construction of ten ne
w classrooms in 1997. Thirty
-
four 
classrooms now house our pre
-
kindergarten through fifth
-
grade students. The facility also includes an information center, music room, offices, and 
resource center. We use our multipurpose room for meals, physical activitie
s, assemblies, and enrichment programs. New portables were added due to 
increased enrollment, and we expanded the playground by adding new play structures. All classrooms are equipped with interact
ive whiteboards.  A 
perimeter security fence was installed 
in 2014.  Computer activity room remodeled in 2017.
 
 
The school is staffed with one day, and one night custodian to provide a clean and hazard
-
free environment. The Principal, along with the maintenance 
staff, work with the custodians to develop cleaning s

which are available at the District Office. In addition, on a monthly basis the lead custodian uses a facility survey instrum
ent developed by the Nort
hern 
California Schools Insurance to evaluate the conditions of the school's facility. These reports are sent to the District Faci
lities Department who then does 
an annual evaluation for the site.

Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanc
ed Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: 
Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
O
pportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parent volunteers play a major role in the successful operation of Manzanita School. Opportunities for involvement include jo
ining the School Site Council 
and/or Parent Club, assisting in the clas
sroom or information center, helping with fundraisers, chaperoning field trips, and serving as art docents. Parents 
also have the opportunity to coach our limited number of sports. Many of our parents also pursue employment opportunities at 
the school and 
become 
Instructional Assistants or Noon Duties. Please call our principal, Jennifer Mosier, for details about how you can get involv
ed.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
A safe and orderly learning environment is our top priority. We have developed and put into practice a comprehensive school s
afety plan and a crisis 
management p
lan that cover all possible disaster scenarios. School personnel, parents, and community members review and update these plan
s annually 
for effectiveness. Students and staff participate in monthly fire drills, periodic earthquake drills, lock
-
down, and an 
annual bus evacuation drill. All visitors 
are required to sign in at the office. Visitors receive a name badge to wear and are directed to the appropriate area on camp
us. Security cameras and 
perimeter fencing was added during summer 2014. Additional camer
as were added in 2016, as was additional fencing.   Displays from the cameras are 
monitored in the school office during school hours.  All gates remain locked during the school day. All visitors must enter t
hrough the office. The school 
safety plan is revi
ewed annually by the School Site Council and the school staff. It was most recently reviewed in December 2019. The school saf
ety plan 
will be reviewed and approved February of 2020.  The safety plan is available for review in the school office.

Types of Services Funded
 
Manzanita School teachers prepare and implement a course of instruction for students according to their grade level content s
tandards. Teaching staff 
engage in weekly grade level and across grade level collaboration to support the diverse needs of learners
 
in the areas of Math, English Language Arts, 
and Social/Emotional development.  The teaching staff also participate in Redding School District professional development ac

meetings to develop curriculum aligned assessments, and com
mon instructional pacing that allows teachers to dialogue and make instructional decisions 
about the needs of learners.  Our campus has a program of instruction called Eagle Time, which addresses the needs of our stu
dents in learning to read, 
using a focus
 
on systematic instruction in phonemic awareness and phonics.  The Eagle Time program  also focuses on meeting the needs of le

s.  All of our 4th grade 
students receive
 
instruction in violin, twice per week.  Fifth grade students have the opportunity to continue instruction in strings, which a
dds, the base, 
cello, and the viola, if they choose. A K

. The focus was vocal and rhythmic 
patterns.
 
 
Students who qualify for support from special education services benefit from instruction with our resource specialist teache
