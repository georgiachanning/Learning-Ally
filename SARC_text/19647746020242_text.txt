Principal's Message
 
 
Our mantra is "Great Families. Great Students. Great School." What makes us so great is the 
ongoing tradition of academic excellence. We celebrate all cultures and languages. The school 
population consists of students, faculty and staff with rich multicult
ural and ethnically diverse 
backgrounds. The students, parents, staff and community work together to ensure success for all 
students.
 
 
Our mission at Lincoln is to challenge, inspire and support our students to make a difference in the 
world in which they 
live on a local and global level. Together, the staff and community of Lincoln 
Elementary School are dedicated to provide a safe environment, a powerful engaging curriculum, 
emphasizing high standards that will empower all students to become motivated, suc
cessful and 
lifelong learners. 
 
 
Our staff is dedicated to the academic success of our students. We are fortunate to have many 
experienced and knowledgeable teachers eager to make a difference for our students. Lincoln 
Elementary provides comprehensive ins
tructional programs that are student centered focusing on 
the student holistically. Such programs are:
 

 
Orton

Gillingham Multi
-
sensory approach to reading instruction
 

 
Positive Behavior Intervention Systems
 

 
AVID

Focus for Improvement
 

 
Our focus for the 2018
-
2019 school year is to increase student achievement in English 
Language Arts and Math. We use district
-
wide common assessments to measure 
student progress every 20 school days. Afterwards, staff holds Data Reflection Sessions 
to gath
er and analyze data in order to plan instruction based upon student needs. We 
also use DORA and ADAM assessments to monitor reading and math growth three 
times per year (September, December and May).
 

 
Our measuring of progress does not stop at the reflectio
n sessions. Based upon our 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement, School Site Councils members (five parents, 
three teachers, one administrator and one classified employee) will visit all classrooms 
to evaluate what every teacher is doing around program qual
ity. We do this because 
we want to meet the state requirement for meeting or exceeding the standards on the 
SBAC.
 
 
Lincoln Elementary School prides itself in involving the parents and community members in every 
aspect of our school. We welcome visitors on 
our campus for many different reasons, including 
Parent Visitation Days for the different curriculum areas, Awards Assemblies, Family Math, Literacy 
Nights, Multicultural Assemblies, and other special events. We believe that parents, community 
members, and
 
staff must collaboratively work together to make an impact in student academic 
progress. We are very proud of our fine traditions and school pride at Lincoln Elementary School.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in Californi
a is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agenc
ies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data repor
ted in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardi
ans and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School Facility Conditions and 
Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Lincoln Elementary provides a safe, clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance and campus supervisi
on. Original school 
buildings were constructed during the 1930s; ongoing maintenance ensure
s school facilities are kept safe and in good working condition, and continue 
to provide adequate space for students and staff. Fourteen new classrooms will be built beginning May 11, 2013 along with the
 
demolition and/or 
removal of temporary bungalows to 
service our students.
 
 

pus grounds are well
-
maintained and kept safe and functioning for students, staff, and visitors. The grounds
 
are constantly monitored to ensure cleanliness and student safety. 
Currently the campus includes 20 permanent classrooms, 14 portables, a library/media center, 2 computer labs, a blacktop play
ground and a grassy play 
area. Lynwood Unified School District 
administers a scheduled maintenance program to make sure that all classrooms and facilities are well
-
maintained. 
The district maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are com
pleted in a timely
 
manner. 
Routine repair work throughout the school district is assigned and accounted for through the use of a work order system. Work
 
orders are received and 
work is assigned on a priority basis.
 
 
During the 2008
-
2009 school year some minor facility repai
rs which included: some re
-
carpeting of classrooms and painting. We have also made some 
technological improvements such as an updated phone system, as well updates to our program servers. During the end of the 201
2
-
2013 school year, 
playground renovations 
and implementation for 14 new classrooms began. This is due to a Measure K bond that passed in November 2012. The 
playground, grassy area, and the front of the school were redeveloped. Ramps were also rebuilt up to current codes, or instal
led in places whe
re they 
were needed.
 
 
More facts about the condition of our school buildings are available in an online supplement to this report called for by the
 
Williams legislation of 2004. 
What you will find is an assessment of more than a dozen aspects of our buildi
ngs: their structural integrity, electrical systems, heating and ventilation 
systems, and more. The important purpose of this assessment is to determine if our buildings and grounds are safe and in good
 
repair. If anything needs 
to be repaired, this assess
ment identifies it and targets a date by which we commit to make those repairs. The guidelines for this assessment were writt
en 
by the Office of Public School Construction (OPSC) and were brought about by the Williams legislation. You can look at the si

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summat
ive Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may parti
cipate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC 
provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Invo
lvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Parents have a variety of opportunities to be involved.  Many of our parents volunteer in classrooms, attend regular parent i
nformation & educational 
meetings and support the instructional program by participating in our schoo
l committees such as English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC), School 
Site Council (SSC), and our Volunteer Program which is coordinated by our Community Liaison.
 
 
Lincoln is committed to working collaboratively with parents and the surrounding community
 
to bring about progress and student success. Abraham 
Lincoln Elementary School genuinely values the input and support of all its members. We believe that parent involvement incre
ases student achievement 
and that is our ongoing responsibility to develop an
d maintain strong home
-
school relationships. Lincoln Elementary has worked diligently to create a 
very strong partnership with our parents and community members.
 
 
Communication with parents and community members occurs through our District Website, notices
 
home, automated phone calls and Lincoln marquee. 
Parents complete surveys and a needs assessment on a yearly basis, which provide the school with input, questions and concern
s. There are monthly 
parent advisory council meetings as well as other opportunit
ies for parents to participate in school events with the help of a Parent Center.
 
 
Our Community Liaison also runs a program for parents who want to volunteer on campus. They can work in the classrooms or sup
port the school 
through work completed in the Pa
rent Center. This program receives high praise from our parents, as it provides them with opportunities to help even 
if they do not feel comfortable working within the classroom.
