By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility 
Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Cecilia L. Solorio Elementary provides a safe and clean environment for learning through proper facilities maintenance 
and campus supervision. Original school buildings were constructed in 2000, and 
ongoing maintenance ensures school 
facilities are kept safe and in good working condition and continue to provide adequate space for students and staff.
 
 
Cecilia L. Solorio Elementary is proud of its high standards regarding campus maintenance and general 
housekeeping 
practices. Staff and students enjoy the benefits of having a well
-
maintained and beautiful campus.
 
 
School staff and the maintenance department work together to ensure playgrounds, classrooms, and campus grounds are 
well
-
maintained. Maintenanc
e and Operations (M&O) oversees a work order process enabling school staff to 
communicate unscheduled maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or special projects. The school secretary is responsible for 
preparing and submitting work orders to M&O for resolution
. Emergency situations are given high priority and resolved 
immediately by site or district custodial staff.

The principal and day custodian communicate daily to address campus maintenance and safety concerns. The director of 
maintenance and operations (M
&O) meets with the principal once a month to discuss maintenance
-
related issues 
associated with campus upkeep, safety, classroom space, equipment, upcoming events, work orders (submitted and 
outstanding), and special requests. The director of M&O then meet
s with the custodian to conduct a comprehensive 
inspection of the school site, and a summary of the inspection findings is forwarded to the principal.
 
 
Schools are required by state law to conduct a formal inspection annually of designated areas and system
s and then 
prepare a report of the current condition of the facilities.  The School Site Inspection table illustrated in this report 
identifies the state
-
required inspection areas and discloses the operational status in each of those areas.

maintenance, and minor repairs. M&O provides formal training twice a year on the proper use of equipment, cleaning 
procedures, and chemical usage. One fu
ll
-
time day custodian is responsible for keeping the campus clean and fully 

cafeteria after meals are served. The custodian checks r
estrooms twice a day as a proactive measure in keeping facilities 
stocked, safe, and sanitary. Every morning before school begins, the day custodian inspects school facilities for safety 
hazards and maintenance issues that require attention before staff an
d students arrive on campus. Any graffiti or signs of 
vandalism are removed immediately.
 
 
A professional janitorial service is responsible for thoroughly cleaning classrooms and restrooms during the evenings. The 
district office dispatches a team of ground

irrigation systems.
 
 
Etiwanda School District participates in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program which provides dollar

matching funds to assist school dist
ricts with major repairs or replacement of existing school building components. These 
repairs typically include roofing, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior/exterior painting, and 
floor systems.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information
 
relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general e
ducation population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAA
s items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses th
at satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.
