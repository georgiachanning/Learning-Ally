By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The Community Day School (CDS) program in the Bass Lake Joint Union Elementary School District has historically been 
very successful at providing for the u
nique educational needs of its students. At Fresno Flats Community Day School, 
students are provided opportunities to succeed, and even excel, in a smaller, more structured environment. In the vast 
majority of cases, students at Fresno Flats experience suc
cess in school, often for the first time in their lives. Improved 
classroom grades, attendance, and behavior have come to be the norm for Fresno Flats students. What makes this 
program even more successful is the carryover of positive behaviors and outcome
s for students in their everyday lives 
away from school, as well as when students complete their course of study at Fresno Flats and return to their home 
campuses. Not only are the returning students avoiding the negative or problem behaviors that caused t
heir program 
placement in the first place, but a significant number of them have excelled in their return to their home campuses. The 
mission statement at Fresno Flats is the same mission statement that guides the entire Bass Lake Joint Union Elementary 
Sc
hool District
---
"Every Child..a Promise". Nowhere in the district is this mission more evident than at Fresno Flats 
Community Day School.
 
 
The District's full mission statement is as follows:
 
We will provide an education that emphasizes reading, 
mathematics, science, technology, communication skills and a 
broad
-
based exposure to culture, fine arts, and other academic disciplines.
 
 
This education will be achieved in an environment which enhances integrity, respect, responsibility, and compassion fo
r 
others. We recognize that these values are best learned when modeled by all adults and children.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in th
e general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Pa
rental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Parents are highly encouraged to take an active role in their child's educational program while enrolled at Fresno Flats 
Community Day School. Parents attend a program induction meeting when the 
determination has been made that their 
child would benefit from a placement at Fresno Flats. Parents, along with their child, are active participants in establishin
g 
goals and objectives for the duration of the placement period. These objectives are contin
ually modified to reflect changes 
in the student's attitude, work habits, academic achievement, and behavior. Due to the small number of students assigned 
to Fresno Flats at any given time, communication with parents takes place on an almost daily basis, w
hich allows 
continuous parental involvement.
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information
 
relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
A Comprehensive School Safety Plan has been established by the District. This plan is reviewed and updated as necessary 
annually by district and site level administration, as well as by the District Safety Officer. The plan contains all mandated
 
components
. This plan is also reviewed by law enforcement and other emergency first responders as necessary. The 
District's Board of Trustees approved the plan at their regular meeting in January 2019. Additionally, Fresno Flats staff 
participates in site level safe
ty meetings with staff from Wasuma Elementary School since Fresno Flats is housed on the 
Wasuma campus in Ahwahnee. Fresno Flats also participates in regular safety and disaster drills in collaboration with 
Wasuma and all other District sites.
