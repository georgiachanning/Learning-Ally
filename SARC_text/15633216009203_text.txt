By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Williams Elementary School is a neighborhood school, located at 1201 Williams Street in East Bakersfield. Williams has a 
culturally diverse student popula
tion of students in Transitional Kindergarten through 5th grade.  The Williams 
School Plan
 
for Student Achievement (SPSA)  is collaboratively developed through annual student data review and analysis by 
stakeholder groups. The Williams SPSA guides all comp
onents of the instructional program in order to reach academic 
goals set forth.  School wide goals related to academic achievement, social emotional learning, family and community 
engagement, as well as professional learning determine the instructional foc
i of the work at Williams in order to create a 
culture of continuous improvement and ensure that all students succeed academically.
 
 
All teachers and staff at Williams Elementary School are committed to meeting the learning needs of students as reflected 
b
y its Vision and Mission. William's Vision is to be a beacon within our community where teachers, staff, students, and 
parents work collaboratively to ensure all students learn at their full potential and become college and/or career ready. 
Our Mission is 
to ensure a safe and nurturing environment for staff and students in which all students achieve at their 
highest academic level, and develop the social skills necessary to be productive citizens. We welcome all parents and 
community members to be actively 
engaged in the learning process.
 
 
As a member of Bakersfield City School District, Williams Elementary School also strives to be a model of educational 
excellence, equity and innovation. Furthermore, Williams is committed to BCSD's Mission of educating all
 
students at the 
highest levels of academic excellence to become collaborative, creative, and critical thinkers who are "future
-
ready". 
Finally, both Williams and BCSD will focus on four core priorities including developing a culture of collective efficacy
 
including our belief in the collective capacity of our staff, developing a culture of teaching and learning including grade 
level mastery of content standards, a culture of student centered schools including the power of positive relationships 
and social
-
emotional learning, and a culture of access and inclusion including a multi
-
tiered system of supports for all 
learners.

The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority
: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
Cal
ifornia Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with altern
ate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for
 
entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Number of school days 
dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Professional development is designed to provide continuous learning opportunities for administrators, teachers, and 
classified personnel. Training opportunities affirm the basic 
philosophy of education that learning is a lifelong process that 
contributes to the well
-
being of the students, teachers, administrators, and community. Professional Development is an 
essential component of effective instruction and student learning.
 
 
All 
training revolves around identified needs of students and adults for the purpose of the improvement of instruction and 
increasing content knowledge. Central to all training are student achievement data, district focus areas, the Common Core 
State Standards
, the state adopted standards
-
based instructional materials, and strategies to effectively teach the 
academic content standards to all students.
 
 
We also provided extensive professional development for Professional Learning Communities through our Service 
Delivery 
Model. On
-
site coaching and support is provided by academic coaches and district specialists for reading/language arts, 
mathematics, science, writing and social emotional learning. The district provides time and resources for collaboration, 
planni
ng, and professional development. Additionally, we provided professional development on Multi
-
Tiered Systems of 
Support and Support to school and district teams.

New teachers with California preliminary credentials received professional development
 
through the Bakersfield City 
School District (BCSD) Teacher Induction Program (TIP). The focus of BCSD TIP is being mentored by an experienced 
teacher, growing in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and meeting the California Induc
tion

tial teaching skills of the CSTP 
including classroom management, lesson planning, assessment, and establishing a climate that is conducive to student 
achievement. Each Intern was assigned a mentor that provided day

advisement 
toward meeting credential requirements. Mentors received monthly professional development in meeting the needs of 
Intern teachers. Interns also received coursework and supervision from universities partnered with BCSD to provide the 
Intern Progr
am.
 
 
Teachers on Short Term Staffing Permits (STSPs) were provided mentors and monthly trainings on beginning pedagogy 
and best teaching practices. Each teacher on a STSP designed a plan to meet requirements to move to a CA Intern or 
Preliminary Credential
. Support was provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners 
to ensure teachers on permits were taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
 
 
Teachers on Provisional Intern Permits (PIPs) were provided a we
ekly cohort meeting focused on beginning pedagogy. 
Two cohort meetings occurred weekly to allow teachers on a PIP to work around university course schedules. Support was 
provided for required testing and BCSD staff worked closely with university partners t
o ensure teachers on permits were 
taking prerequisite requirements to move to credentials.
