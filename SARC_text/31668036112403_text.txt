About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school i
n California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educat
ional agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally,
 
data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC
 
requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/

For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

Quality, Currency, Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District held a Public Hearing on September 19, 2019, and determined that each school withi
n the District has sufficient 
and good quality textbooks, instructional materials, or science lab equipment pursuant to the settlem
ent of Williams vs. the State of California. All 
students, including English learners, are given their own individual standards
-
aligned textbooks or instructional materials, or both, in core subjects for 
use in the classroom and to take home. In grades 6
-
8
 
each student receives a textbook available to keep at home and has a class set of textbooks to use 
at school. Online access to textbooks is also an available option for mathematics, English Language Arts/English Language Dev
elopment (ELA/ELD), and 
History
 
Social
-
Science in grades kindergarten through eight. Instructional materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the State
 
Department 
of Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by
 
the State are reviewed by all teachers 
and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of teachers and administrators. All recomm
ended materials are 
available for parent examination at each school site, the district offi
ce, and in some cases online prior to adoption. The table displays information about 
the quality, currency, and availability of the standards

and regulations pertaining to 
hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. The School Site Safety plan was last reviewed and
 
updated on January 17, 2019, by the School 
Safety Committee/School Site Council. The annual review for the 2019
-
2020 school year is scheduled for February 2020. All revisions were communicated 
to both the classified and certificated staff. The school's di
saster preparedness plan includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety during a disaster.  
Different types of safety drills, such as fire, lockdown/barricade, and earthquake drills are conducted on a monthly basis th
roughout the school year. 
Student

ring lunch.  Quail Glen 
underwent a thorough threat analysis with written recommendations for consideration and incremental impleme
ntation in Fall 2015.  These 
recommendations were reviewed with input from the school site council, site leadership, and general school staff. There is a 
designated area for student 
drop off and pick up and  classified/certificated staff are responsible fo
r the supervision of all students during lunch and recess break periods.  Visitors

l times while on campus.   
New designated protoc
ols, procedures and location maps pertaining to the reunification of students and families in case of emergency evacuation ha
