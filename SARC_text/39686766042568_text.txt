About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish 
a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a L
ocal Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent wit
h data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should cont
act the school principal or the 
district office.

The main fact about textbooks that the Williams legislation calls for described whether schools have books in core classes fo
r all students. The law also 
asks districts to reveal whe
ther those books are what the California content standards calls for. This information is far more meaningful when along with
 

mes o

in our core classes and their dates of publication.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achi
evement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the 
California State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

evacuate the students, based upon the site and district emergency preparedness plans. A site review with the district Interna

raining takes place at staff meetings monthly where 
staff discusses emergency drills and table top discussions on topics related to student and staff safety. A new program calle
d, "Share 911" has been 
incorporated into our safety plan.  The program allows 
teachers to be alerted and communicate via phone or computer.
 
 
Alongside a Positive Behavior Intervention and Support(PBIS) plan addendum the safety plan helps to provide a secure, peacefu
l and clean environment 

ter Preparedness Plan identifies procedures to follow during emergencies and natural disasters. Emergency
