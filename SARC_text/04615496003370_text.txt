Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Thermalito has a District
-
wide Comprehensive School Safety Plan, Pursuant to Education Code 32280 

 
32289. Our vision 
is to empower all stakeholders in order to create a safe and challenging environment where all students and staff can be 
safe and grow academically, socially, and emotionally. We will provide an environment which allows for the developmen
t 
of attitudes that promote healthful physical, social, academic, and mental habits. This will be accomplished by encouraging 
pride in self achievement, respect and responsibility toward self and others, recognition of students and staff, and positive
 
rela
tionships with young people. The Safe Schools Plan is updated annually in accordance with Senate Bill 187. The key 
elements of the Safe School Plan are the District Crisis Response Plan and a safe schools action plan. The action plan 
addresses two question
s: 1) how can we improve our efforts in creating a caring and connected school climate and 2) how 
can we improve our efforts in creating a physical environment that communicates respect for learning and for individuals. 
The key elements of the District Cri
sis Response Plan are evacuation procedures, hostage crisis, loss of power and water, 
fallen aircraft, air quality alerts, chemical spills, civil defense/disorder, drive
-
by shootings, bomb threats, fire emergency, 
imminent danger procedures (lockdowns), an
d earthquakes. A copy of these procedures is available in the school office 
for viewing.
 
 
The Sierra Avenue Community adopted four schoolwide expectations to guide our work, which are Be Safe, Be Kind, Be 
Respectful, and Be Responsible.  Students are encou
raged to keep our schoolwide expectations in mind throughout the 
school day. Students are recognized for displaying appropriate behavior at school. Students with exemplary behavior are 

ssemblies and for their improved behavior at our 
weekly Thunderbird Award assemblies. Also, students are given good behavior tickets if they are caught in the act of 
displaying one of the character traits. Tickets are drawn at our weekly Friday morning ope
ning assemblies.
