Vision of the San Carlos School District
 
The San Carlos School District shall provide an innovative and engaging learning experience that 
fosters the development of the Whole Child to ensure all students are well 
prepared for success in 
the 21st Century, as evidenced by:
 
1.
 
Reaching their highest academic, social, emotional, intellectual, and physical potential; 
and
 
2.
 
Becoming problem solvers, critical thinkers, risk
-
takers, designers, collaborators, and 
innovators; and
 
3.
 
Developing into contributing, empathic citizens and leaders who are responsible stewards 
of their world and care about equity and justice, both locally and worldwide
 
 
Principal's Message
 
Central Middle School is committed to building a stro
ng community of learners modeled around 
the 5Cs (Citizenship, Collaboration, Creativity, Critical Thinking, and Communication). Student 
ownership and project
-
based learning are emphasized.  We use a framework of Positive Behavior 
Intervention and Support (
PBIS) to create a strong sense of school culture.  At CMS we continually 
strive to create a positive, inclusive learning environment with a community of students, staff, and 
parents who are RESPONSIBLE, RESPECTFUL, SUPPORTIVE and SAFE.
 
 



providing rich learning experiences for children in a warm, caring environment. We offer 
a range of 
elective classes providing both support and enrichment opportunities for students.  After a major 
remodel and addition completed during the 2014
-
2015 school year, our students moved into a 
brand new building designed with innovative learning spa
ces that encourage community building, 
flexible groupings and blended learning. Over 550 sixth through eighth grade students are enrolled 
during the 2018
-
19 school year, with classes arranged on a modified block schedule with a 
traditional calendar.  We sh
are our campus with Arroyo School (a 4/5 upper elementary school), 
which opened in the fall of 2016.   We offer after school enrichment opportunities including 
athletics, theater, homework support, Drum Line and Math Olympiad.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of ea
ch year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula 
(LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address 
state and local pr
iorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE L
CFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

San Carlos School District holds a public hearing annually determine that each school within the district has sufficient and 
good quality textbooks. 
instructional materials, or science lab equipment 
pursuant to the settlement of Williams vs. the State of California. All students, including English learners, 
are given their own individual instructional materials in core subjects for use in the classroom and to take home. Textbooks

erials 
are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of Education and in alignment with the development of
 
State Standards and 
Frameworks, making the textbooks and materials used in the school the most currently available. As part
 
of the adoption process, materials are piloted 
and selected by a selection committee composed primarily of teachers and including other staff as necessary. When materials a
re being recommended 
for adoption, they are made available for parent examination a
t the district office prior to adoption and/or parents are invited to provide input via other 
means. Recommendations from the committee are then brought to the Board for adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Imp
rovements (Most Recent Year)
 
Central Middle School was originally built in 1939, but recently underwent major redevelopment which included the constructio
n of a new building and 
the remodel of existing structures. At the beginning of the 2015
-
16 school yea
r, students and staff moved into the new building located on the northwest 
side of campus. The new building consists of a total of 22 classrooms  located in two connected buildings. The North Atrium i
ncludes: four science labs, 
four special education class
rooms, four math rooms, a tinkering lab, and an art room. Our ELA and social studies classrooms are located in the south 
atrium. The new buildings also consist of nine breakout rooms for student use and two large learning atriums. Many of our cla
ssrooms ar
e connected by 
movable walls, which allows for flexible learning spaces and cross curricular learning activities.  All classrooms contain la
rge screen monitors with Apple 
TVs for projections and a cart of chromebooks available for student use.
 
 
Three origi
nal buildings remained: the gym, North Hall and the Fine Arts Building. North Hall was remodeled during the 2006
-
07 school year and consists 
of boys and girls locker rooms, the kitchen and a multi purpose room. In 2007 our Multi
-
Purpose room was officially
 

used for community events. The Fine Arts Building underwent a full remodel and was reopened during the 2015
-
16 school year. This building houses our 
band room, orchestra room and library. Our outdoor spaces consist of a p
lay structure, a quad area, a blacktop and a field which we share with Arroyo 
Upper Elementary School located on our campus.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school 
district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
A hallmark of our success as a school can be attributed to the strong support of our parent c
ommunity. Parents truly are "partners in education" at 
Central. While it is typical for parent participation to drop off as children get older, we are lucky enough to have many par
ent volunteers who work 
tirelessly on projects at Central ranging from drivi
ng on field trips, serving hot lunch, teaching Art in Action lessons in 6th grade, fundraising and coaching. 
Parents take leadership roles in our community by serving on the PTA Executive Board, chairing various committees and serving
 
on the School Site 
Co
uncil.  Our parents participate in district
-
wide committees to ensure equity for all students including our District English Language Advisory Committee 
(DELAC) and Special Education District Advisory Committee (SEDAC).  Our parents also participate in the
 
San Carlos Education Foundation and many of 
our parents volunteer with Healthy Cities Tutoring, providing academic support to students throughout the district.
 
 
Parents stay informed about what is happening at our school via our weekly school newsletter, 
school Facebook page, and teacher websites.  Student 
progress is communicated with parents via our Illuminate portal and report cards at the end of each trimester.  We offer pare
nt teacher conferences to 
all families in the fall and parent education nights
 
on various topics of interest throughout the year.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Oth
er local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Central Middle School. The school is always in compliance with all laws,
 
rules, and regulations 
pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Our School Resource Officer, provided by 
the local sheriff's department, works closely 
with school administration to maintain a safe and secure campus.  The school's disaster preparedness plan follows San Mateo C
ounty's Big Five Protocols 
and includes steps for ensuring student and staff safety d
uring a disaster.  The School Site Safety plan is reviewed and updated annually in the fall by the 
School Safety Committee. Safety protocols and revisions to the plan are communicated to faculty regularly during staff meetin
gs. Big Five drills are 
conducte
d on a regular basis throughout the school year and debriefed at monthly staff meetings. Food and emergency supplies are hous
ed in the 
campus emergency container.  We also follow county protocols for suicide prevention and threat assessment.  In addition, 
we have added Suicide 
Prevention Hotline and Support information on the back of every student ID card. Students are supervised by staff before scho
ol. during lunch and after 
school. There is a designated area for student drop off and pick up and crossing g
uards at busy intersections near the school.
 
 
Central also considers the health and well being of all students on campus through our social
-
emotional learning curriculum, Second Step, and through 
activities designed to create a supportive and inclusive cli
