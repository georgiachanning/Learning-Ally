Published During 2019

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

look at criteria used overall in

2. We then form a committee of administrators, teachers (representatives from all grade levels) and par
-
ents.
 
 
3. The committee reviews, researches and identifies essential 
K
-
8 curriculum and assesses needs.
 
 
4. The committee establishes consensus on the most important criteria to evaluate during initial screen
-
ing.
 
 
5. Depending on how many textbook programs have been approved, we make arrangements to preview samples. An initial 
preview may be necessary to determine whether the committee needs to preview all samples. All textbooks are from the 
state
-
approved list.
 
 
6.
 
The committee conducts evaluations, pilots, reviews, and shares the conclusions with administrators and staff.
 
 
7. Community members are invited to review curriculum and provide feedback.
 
 
8. The committee submits its recommendation to the school board fo
r approval and, finally, implements the new program, 
monitors, and modifies or supplements when necessary.
 
 
9. The district has affirmed that each pupil, including English learners, has his or her own textbook to use in class and to 
take home.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
At Monticello Elementary School, students are monitored consistently throughout the school day. Yard supervisors, 
teachers, the site administrator
 
and other school personnel provide supervision for students before, during and after 
school, as well as at school events. All visitors are required to sign in at the office and receive proper authorization in o
rder 
to be on campus. A school visitors badge
 
must be displayed at all times. We utilize an Ident
-
A
-
Kid visitor management 
system to track visitors and volunteers. In addition, it requires parents to digitally check their child in or out, providing
 
a 
more accurate account of children on campus at a g
iven time.
 
 
We at Monticello Elementary School take pride in our campus. We work together and strive to keep our campus clean 
and graffiti free. Our Associated Student Body officers and representatives often partake in community service 
opportunities both 
on our campus and throughout the community.  Our maintenance team takes pride in a well
-
kept 
campus, and is committed to keeping our school clean, well maintained, organized and safe. All school facilities are 
meticulously cared for and in exemplary status
. We are never without custodial assistance throughout the school day. The 

A scheduled maintenance program is administered by Jeffe
rson School District to ensure that all classrooms, restrooms, 
and facilities are well maintained and in good repair. Their prompt response to staff and student needs is greatly 
appreciated.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAA
s] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which a
re linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of Cal
ifornia and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

classroom, emergency procedures are posted by each door, along with an emergency backpack containing various survival 
items, firs

aid supplies, and emergency contact information. Our District Safety Committee updates our emergency 
backpacks on an as
-
needed basis. The posted emergency procedures include general information regarding actions to be 
taken should any of the following ev

student protocol, campus 
shooting, earthquakes, bomb threat and checklist, explosion, chemical accident, and lockdown.

level representatives maintain an emergency procedure plan that 
they disseminate and implement, should the 
need arise. Such a plan includes staff phone tree information, evacuation locations and procedures, and various 
emergency responsibilities. Monthly emergency drills are conducted, allowing ample practice for both 
students and staff. 
All drills are conducted in a timely manner, and debriefed to ensure any necessary changes are made.
 
 
Jefferson School District is committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. In order to 
achieve this goal
, the district has developed an Injury and Illness Prevention Program for its employees. It is designed to 
minimize workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses. In making safety a high priority, injuries and illnesses are reduced, 
whilst we see an increase
 
in overall productivity. Hazard and safety awareness helps to provide a secure, peaceful and 
clean environment for the entire school community.
 
 
The site safety plan was reviewed and discussed with the staff in September 2019. We use our safety plan, alon

We encourage teachers to attend outside conferences and workshops to further their education and stay current in recent 
educational research. Minimum days are scheduled throughout the year for teachers to participate in ongoing staff 
development at both th
e site and district levels. Teachers participate in ongoing staff development at the site as well as 
the county level. Professional
-
development methods include: after
-
school workshops, conferences, and individual 
mentoring and coaching. Teachers have parti
cipated in Common Core English language arts, math, writing, Guided 
Language Acquisition Design (GLAD), meeting the needs of special populations, technology training and district 
instructional norms. Grade
-
level collaboration teams also worked together to 
develop Common Core
-
aligned instructional 
guides, assessments and professional learning community collaboration.
