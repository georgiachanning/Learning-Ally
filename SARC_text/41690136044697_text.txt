About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information about
 
the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State 
Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: 
Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments
 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student 
Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which includes the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English langua
ge arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Co
mmon Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the Ca
lifornia State University, or career technical 
education sequences or programs of study

District and site provide time and resources for collaboration, planning, and professional development for all staff. In the 
2018
-
2019 
school year, teachers 
used SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade
 
levels. Teachers met in 
departments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, 
as well as identify needs for their department.
 
This was done on Site
-
designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professi
onal 
development days were also used to provide teachers with
 
additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly 
in regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects. The math department used Professional Developm
ent days to begin on 
going collabo
ration with the math department at Capuchino High School, our feeder high school, with a focus on routines in reasoning and p
roblem
-
based lesson structures.
 
 
In addition, 2018
-
2019 saw the implementation of the site Instructional Learning Team, which met t
wice a month to collaborate and create a site plan 
that focuses on improving instruction.
