By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability 
Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Account
ability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
reported in the S
ARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the 
LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the sc
hool 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at
 
libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software progr
ams available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Textbooks and supplementary materials are adopted according to a cycle developed by the California Department of 
Education, making the textbooks used in the school the most current available. Materials approved for use by the State 
are r
eviewed by all teachers and a recommendation is made to the School Board by a selection committee composed of 
teachers and administrators. All recommended materials are available for parent examination at the district office prior 
to adoption.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The campus is well maintained and the staff, students, and families take pride in their clean and safe campus.  Caswell is 
an older site so a strict maintenance 
plan is extremely critical to the upkeep of the school.  Mature trees create a pleasant 
park like atmosphere and are well maintained as are the many lawns and large field in the rear of the school.  All staff are 
trained and instructed to report all safety
 
hazards immediately.  The facility is evaluated on a regular basis by both site 
administration and district personnel. Overall the site looked well maintained. Custodian and his team are commended 
for several areas at the site. The grounds were well prune
d and mowed, the restrooms were very clean, overall the Library 
was clean, and there were minimal chemical issues. This year the site earns a 9 out of 10. Continue to work together to 
get the site in top shape.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The 
SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative 
Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participa
te in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students w
ho have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The staff and administration
 
at Caswell Elementary School are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for 
students and employees.  Our Safe School Plan is designed to assist staff and students in preparing for emergencies, 
managing emergency response efforts, and maintai
ning a safe school environment.  Additionally, it will assist our school 
in providing a safe and civil learning environment. This plan was developed in compliance with California Code of 
Regulations, Title V, Education, Section 560 and is based on input fr
om administrators, teachers, paraprofessionals, clerical 
staff, custodians, and other staff, parents, students, and law enforcement representatives.  The major goal of this plan is 
to assist our school site in preparing for the potential of emergency situa
tions. Our school continually strives to develop a 
comprehensive program, including ways to develop a culture that promotes responsibility, safety, respect, and 
opportunity for all.  Our school is working work with staff, students, and parents to create a 
Safe and Civil school, which 
demonstrates our Guidelines for Success.  We are using PBIS to promote this goal.  It encompasses being positive, 
responsible, respectful, compassionate, always exhibiting integrity and pursuing excellence through meeting chall
enges. 
Areas that address school
-
wide encouragement procedures continue to be reexamined and updated.
 
 
We are aware that one of the aspects of a safe school environment is the quality of the security and maintenance of the 
school grounds.  The safety and a
ppearance of the school grounds are likely to make an immediate impression on students, 
parents, and the community.  That is why we continue to work hard to create an environment that is inviting and promotes 
safety, pride, sense of ownership, and freedom 
from fear.  Providing a safe environment allows us to nurture in each 
student, the desire to contribute and to make meaning out of life.  Safe and Civil Schools promotes and annual evaluation 
of safety preparedness including emergency procedures. Staff and
 
students need to feel adequately prepared to deal with 
natural disasters, medical emergencies, and student behavior emergencies.

The school site had 5 professional development days during the 2017

2018 school year.  In the 2018

2019 school year, 
the school site had 5 professional development days and 9 collaboration/early release days. Lastly, in the 
2019

school year, the school site has planned 10 collaboration/early release days and 5 professional development days.
 
 
Staff development is a critical component to teacher and student success, and Ceres Unified School District is dedicated 
to a varie
ty of professional development opportunities for staff. Teachers attend grade level and staff meetings where 
professional development and staff collaboration on student achievement are the highest priorities.
 
 
Caswell utilizes research based "best practice
s" through the implementation of the CUSD Instructional Norms and the 
Ceres Certification of Direct Instruction process. Teachers work in collaborative teams to share lessons and best practices, 
examine data to learn how students are learning, and make pla

and celebrate our successes. Teachers have attended various workshops to support this work. The staff has also studied 
research and implemented practices from the 90
-
90
-
90 schools research and Du
al Immersion research.
 
 
The district participates in Ceres Induction Program and other county and state approved formal training programs 
dedicated to improving teacher quality.  In addition, the district fully supports classroom teachers with a cadre of f
ull time 
staff developer/coaches who can assist with the implementation of curriculum and strategies.
 
 
School sites must include a professional development plan and budget in their school site plan.  Activities can include 
attendance at summer institutes, 
after school or Saturday workshops, teacher release days to attend conferences, and 
grade level or department release days for in depth professional development.  All professional development is aligned to 
the district strategic plan. The goal of all profe
ssional development is to increase student achievement.
