By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Fletcher School was built in 1966. Although the school is old, it is in 
good repair overall. However, the report showed some 
issues that need attention, due to parts and equipment being aged or showing heavy use over time. Primary, upper and 
Kindergarten student restrooms were remodeled over the summer, and new fixtures were i
nstalled. Several storage 
rooms have signs of age such as old floor tiles missing or dry
-
rot in doorways. There were several areas that are rated as 
having a deficiency, but were addressed. Any concerns that directly affect students, such as the issues wit
h the restrooms 
have been addressed. All safety issues are dealt with immediately by district maintenance.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California 
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [E
LA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Sta
ndards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State Univers
ity, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parents are 
encouraged to be involved at Fletcher School in many ways. Many volunteer on campus in the classrooms by 
working with small groups of students, one
-
on
-
one, or by helping the teacher during field trips or Art Masters. Some prefer 
to volunteer for clerical w
ork in the school office. Parents who work can support our goals and objectives at home, and 
those with internet access can use one of the many programs available to students to help supplement learning. Many of 
our Mandarin Program parents volunteer in th
e classroom, some are native Mandarin speakers and can assist with 
language. We have a Mandarin Parent Council with a grade level representative from each grade, and a parent meeting 
every trimester with updates from the Mandarin program. We invite parents
 
to assist in any way they feel comfortable or 
are able. In addition, many parents participate in the organizations we have at Fletcher, such as PTSA, School Site Council 
or ELAC. Parents also have the opportunity to participate in school
-
wide activities s
uch as STEAM Night, 100 Mile Club, 
Falcons on the Green Movie Nights, Book Fair, and the Super Buck Store. Each trimester family members are invited for 
Lunch with Loved Ones to join students for lunch on the school campus. On the last Friday of the month 
parents are invited 
to attend our Fletcher Flag Assembly where select students are given awards for John Wooden's Pyramid of Success 
Character Education, and students with perfect attendance for the month are recognized. In addition, there are awards 
assem
blies scheduled every trimester and parents are notified if their student is receiving an award.

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 


 
32289, a Comprehensive 
Safe School Plan particular to their site. Each school site is required annually, by March 1st
, to have reviewed, and if 
necessary, updated their Safe School Plan. Each school forwards its Safe School Plan to the district through the office of 
School and Community Services. The office of School and Community Services provides plan development assis
tance to 
the schools and maintains a file of individual school plans available for inspection by the public.
 
 
The School Safety Plan was developed and approved using a collaborative process respectful of representation from all 
stakeholder groups. The Scho
ol Safety Plan is a public document and is readily available for inspection at the school site 
and at the district office. Our objective under Component One (People and Programs) was for staff to implement a 
character development program through Positive B
ehavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS). Students will have daily 
opportunities to earn PBIS  points, bi
-
monthly opportunities to exchange PBIS points for prizes in the Super Bucks Store. 
Awards Assemblies will be held monthly, as well as each trimester
 
to recognize students for their character, academic 
efforts and accomplishments (including Reading Counts) as well demonstrating Falcon PRIDE. Students will also be 
recognized for perfect attendance. PBIS/Discipline assemblies will be held twice a year an
d as needed. Our objective under 
Component Two (School's Physical Environment) was for staff and students, in the event of an emergency, to implement 
proper safety procedures through the district earthquake Emergency Operations Plan (eEOP). Activities incl
uded eEOP 
professional development for staff, emergency scenario drills, monthly safety team meetings and inventory of emergency 
supplies. In addition, we conduct regular fire, earthquake and lock
-
down drills in compliance with state law. Our district 
eEOP
 
policies and procedures are available on the OUSD website through the department of School and Community 
Services (SCS).

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018
-
19)
 
 
A variety of programs and supplemental services are provided at Fletcher, some through LCFF Supplemental funds. Lexia 
is an online program that places students at their reading level and they work independently through 18 levels of reading 
skills. Reading 
Counts is an online program in which students read a book and then take a test to show comprehension 
and Lexile Level. Because Fletcher has a high population of SES students who receive free and reduced lunch but are not 
eligible for Title I funding, the d
istrict supports 75% of the salary for a Resource Teacher to support classroom teachers to 
implement strategies, to pull intervention groups, and provide GATE instruction. Funding for library books, supplemental 
materials and technology are available to st
udents who are English Learners, low income or Foster Youth. Fletcher School 
participates in Positive Schoolwide Intervention and Supports (PBIS) which includes a 3
-
tiered intervention approach to 
students with behavior difficulties.  PTSA also provides so
me funding for PBIS.  After
-
school tutoring is given to those 
students needing additional intervention in reading or math, and is funded through LCFF.  Staff professional development 
is delivered to teachers and support staff areas of need as identified by
 
the teachers and administrators.
