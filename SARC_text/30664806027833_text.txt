School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-
19 School Year
 
Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

Frank Vessels Elementary School is committed to equipping students with the tools they need for academic, personal, and 
social achievement.
 
 
Frank Vessels Elementary School enables every student to reach their highest potential by establishing a
 
curriculum that 
meets or exceeds government standards for education; providing extracurricular programs that develop children's mental, 
physical and social skills; and partnering with parents and the community to create an environment geared to the succes

of all students.
 
 
WE BELIEVE...
 
 
Each student is an individual who is deserving of respect, fairness, and understanding.
 
 
School experiences should provide opportunities for each child to do his or her best.
 
 
Learning is a lifelong experience.
 
 
The 
learner must be nurtured within a respectful, cooperative environment.
 
 
Learning will combine process and knowledge to support one's growth as a whole person.
 
 
Teaching must be varied and creative to meet the individual needs of students.
 
 
Parents and the 
staff must recognize and encourage the important role that each has in the child's education.
 
 
The school community recognizes and appreciates the valuable contribution of the community at large to education. At 
Frank Vessels School, we recognize that Amer

our community have a right to knowledge, skills, discipline, values, and the virtues that will assist them in achieving a 
productive, fulfilled life. Vessels School staff is comm
itted to providing children with opportunities to build character, self

The SARC provides the following 
information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which

California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of th
e CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed
 
courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

meetings, teacher

principal meetings, districtwide minimum days, and districtwide professional development.
 
 
Priorities for training correl
ate with data analysis from multiple sources, indicating students' strengths and needs.  In 
2016/17, professional development focused on Thinking Maps, Setting the Stage, and Write From the Beginning.  For the 
2017/18 school year, districtwide professional
 
development days focused on Writing and Math. The focus for the 2018/19 
school year is English/Language Arts.  Teachers receive on
-
going professional development to support the implementation 
of ELA standards through the adoption of the new Benchmark Adva
nce program.  Continued support for Thinking Maps 
and Writing and their integration with Benchmark was provided.
 
 
The districtwide coaching model has focused on using data to differentiate instruction.  Coaches also meet with grade
-
level teams to support t
he implementation of the Benchmark program and the use of data.  District STEM TOSA's provide 
support and training to teachers related to Next Generation Science Standards and STEM instructional modules. This 
includes in
-
class support and coaching.   Job

s
pecific professional development occurs for other staff (speech therapists, 
instructional aides, special education staff members, etc.) during district meetings, minimum days, and districtwide 
professional development days.  In addition, specialists attend
 
workshops, conferences, and receive support from our 
SELPA.
