California Assessment of Student Performance andProgressThe California Assessment of Student Performance andProgress (CAASPP) System includes the Smarter BalancedSummative Assessments (SBAC) for students in the generaleducation population, and the California Alternate Assessments(CAAs) for students with the most significant cognitivedisabilities.
