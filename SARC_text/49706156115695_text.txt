School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and Mission 
Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Meadow View Elementary is a school with a vision that states in partnership with our families and communities we will 
develop innovative and productive leaders tomorrow through a safe school environment supported by our sc

plan. There is a firm belief that all students can learn and once individual strengths are identified, we are responsible for
 
providing opportunities for our students to be successful and thus gain in confidence and self
-
esteem. This year we 
are 
focusing on innovative Early Literacy and technology programs. We are also participating in the development of area wide 
content and performance standards in Language Arts and Mathematics.
 
 
Meadow View's mission is to provide a positive academic learni
ng environment where all students will be empowered to 
think creatively and critically.
 
 
All classroom teachers are fully credentialed. All staff members are dedicated to nurturing the whole child through a high 
quality core curriculum. Students with speci
al needs have full access to the core curriculum. This curriculum aligns with 
the California Common Core Standards.
 
 
Meadow View is a K
-
6 elementary school, located in the rural southwest of Santa Rosa. We have approximately 402 
students. We have 15 genera
l education teachers, 1 RSP teacher, 2 intern SDC teachers, 3 literacy paraprofessional and 7 
student supervisors. Many of our students live one or more miles away, and are transported to and from school by bus. 
Spanish is the primary language of most of o
ur students. Meadow View has a huge extended family, and the campus is 
host to many programs and classrooms that serve our students and their families, including  AmeriCorp/CalSERVES 
volunteers serving as tutors and after
-
school teachers.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summativ
e Assessments for students in the general education population and the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may partici
pate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of 
students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

e Fairs and sporting events. The newest event we have added through parent 
input is a family Bbq prior to Back to School Night and Open House.
 
 
Parents are also encouraged to volunteer at our school.  Parents can assist in the classrooms, or accompany stud

wide safety drills are conducted monthly. The School Plan is 
updated annually and was last updated in the Fall of 2019 and approved by the School Board. School Safety is discussed 
at the School Site Council meetings,
 
PTA meetings, and during Certificated and Classified staff meetings. At Meadow View 
School we believe that student safety is our highest priority.

Number of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement
 
 
 
 
 
Ongoing professional development is an important part of improving our school program. Our school district invests 
heavily in professional development and as a result our students receive excellent instruction. The school district and 
Meadow View School pr
ovide professional development targeted to raise student performance on the CAASPP. The major 
improvement efforts this year have focused on English language development, and ELPAC training. Site leadership team 
including principal and teachers have been pa
rticipating in the California Principal Support Network which focuses on 
developing and sustaining a strong professional learning community with a collaborative culture. 100% of the teachers at 
our school have engaged in advanced training designed to promo
te specific skills or information related to these school 
priorities and objectives. Our district also provides individualized coaching through the use of a teacher on special 
assignment and release time to observe in other classrooms for teachers to recei
ve additional professional development 
and support in individual areas of need. Teachers meet at least weekly in PLCs and collaboration time to analyze student 
data, plan instruction and evaluate student learning. Technology is used extensively to disaggre
gate and analyze student 
data to guide instruction.
