School Accountability Report Card
 
Reported Using Data from the 2018
-

Published During 2019
-

By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

It is my privilege to serve as principal of Terrace Elementary

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
Terrace School was 
originally built in 1951. The school has a total of 31 classrooms (11 permanent and 20 portable), a 
multipurpose facility, a library/resource building, and an administration building. Twelve of the portable classrooms are 
across the street from the main ca
mpus at the Terrace Annex. The multi
-
purpose building and additional permanent 
classrooms were added in 1954. Portable classrooms were constructed in 1987, 1997, 1998, and 2003.
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, 
and functional. Terrace School grounds and 
buildings are supervised by site administrators. Repair needs are reported promptly to the district maintenance staff. 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good worki
ng order are completed in 
a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service and that emergency repairs are given the highest 
priority. The Maintenance, Operations, and Transportation Department works daily with the custodial staff t
o develop 

 
 
Terrace has put into place an effective supervision plan for students before, during, and after school. Morning yard duty 
staff are on grounds thirty minu
tes before students are allowed on campus. Morning and noon duty aides are assigned to 
supervise students on school grounds and in the cafeteria on a daily basis. School personnel supervise students during 
morning recesses and after school. Terrace has one
 
main locked entrance and all visitors have to check
-
in at the office and 

has adopted the computer program software that will identi
fy any known risks the individual may have prior to entering 

the office, send them back to the office to check
-
in and receive a pas
s. All students being picked up early during school 
hours must be signed out in the office. All kindergarten students must also be signed out on a daily basis from their 
classrooms after school.

B. Pupil Outcomes
 
 
State Priority: Pupil Achievement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State 
priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):
 

 
Statewide assessments 
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System, which 
includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and
 
the 
California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three 
through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items 
are aligned wit
h alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for 
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities); and
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirem
ents for entrance to 
the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs 
of study.

Parent participation is highly encouraged at Terrace. Parent conferences are held regularly to discuss student 
achievement. Terrace Elementary school also hol

provide intervention for our students who are not performing at grade level.  Parents and students set academic goals

School Safety 
Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The School Safety Plan was reviewed with staff on July 31st, 2019.
 
 
The staff at Terrace reviews and updates our school safety plan annually. Copies of the comprehensive disaster plan and 
evacuation routes are posted in each cl
assroom. The Safety Plan contains roles and responsibilities of each staff member 
in the event of an emergency. It also includes an assessment of the current status of school crime and the identification 
of appropriate programs and strategies to ensure sch
ool safety. The plan addresses various procedural steps including 
child abuse reporting, discipline, notification to teachers regarding student suspensions and expulsions, along with other 
measures to promote school safety. All staff members have been inst
ructed in first aid procedures. Terrace School 
students and staff practice a variety of safety drills including fire drills, earthquake drills, lock downs, CODE Blue, and b
us 
evacuation drills
 
 
Also, the School Safety Plan will be reviewed with our School 
Site Council committee in January of 2020.
