Principals Message
 
 
Washington Elementary School is a great place to be! The community, parents, staff, and students 
create an environment of life long learning and mutual respect. Together we recognize the need to 
provide a nurturing, well
-
balanced classroom environment that
 
is driven by rigor, relevance, and 
relationships. Our staff and teachers work collaboratively to implement the California Common 
Core State standards, maintain a rigorous core curriculum and focus on student learning. Teachers 
meet regularly to discuss th
eir grade level data from common assessments. During these 
reflections, teachers define barriers, adjust instruction and plan interventions for student success.
 
 
Our students enjoy coming to Washington. We have a very caring and nurturing staff that focuse
s 
on student needs, student achievement, and most importantly, on student growth and learning. 
We work to provide all students a well rounded curriculum to develop the perseverance in every 
child. Students are recognized for outstanding academic effort and
 
citizenship.
 
 
Washington Elementary School is one of the largest and oldest schools in the Lynwood Unified 
School District. We have many dedicated teachers that have worked at Washington for 10 years or 
more. This continuity helps establish a culture of h
igh expectations for all current and future 
students. We have been fortunate to have alumni return as teachers who take pride in supporting 
the Washington community of learners. The result of our collaboration, focused teaching and 
learning has resulted in
 
continuous improvement on the District Benchmarks and SBAC the highest 
in Lynwood Unified School District.
 
 
Washington is committed to providing all of our students with a quality education.
 
 
Sandra Verduzco, Principal
 
 
Major Achievements
 

 
During the 2018
-
2019 school year, Washington Elementary earned the 2019 L.A. Top 
Schools Award. Washington Elementary was one of the 279 top public schools in the 
L.A. County to receive this award for narrowing the achievement gap for underserved 
students.
 

 
During the 2016
-
2017 school year, Washington Elementary School showed improved 
student learning in both Language Arts and Mathematics as measured by the SBAC.
 

 
Our teachers meet in professional learning communities to establish goals, develop 
interim assessments for our unit standards, and discuss ways in which to support 
students who are not meeting goals. They share research
-
based strategies, best 
practices, lo
ok at student work, and plan instruction for future learning.
 

 
During our Data Reflection meetings, teachers and administration analyze district 
common assessment data to discuss meeting District proficiency target goals in English 
language arts and Mathema
tics, organized by individual student performance and 
subgroups. Our goal is to identify struggling students and create interventions. For 
those students meeting the goals, teachers discuss enrichment opportunities and 
differentiation opportunities, to con
tinue their learning and development.
 

 
On November 29, 2016 We opened a brand new Coding and Robotics Laboratory. This 
lab will provide students the opportunity to explore and discover while acquiring 21st 
Century Skills in the areas of Computer Programming
 
and Engineering.

About the SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activi
ties to address 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional in
formation about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

C. Engagement
 
 
State Priority: Parental Involvement
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Parental Involvement (Priority 3):
 

 
Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site
 
 
Opportunities for Pare
ntal Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
We show great pride in our parental involvement at Washington Elementary School. In the 2018
-
2019 school year, we officially established a Parent
-
Teacher Organization (PTO), which has served as a great source of suppo
rt to improve our school and students' educational experiences.
 
 
Our School Site Council (SSC) plays an important role in decision
-
making at the school. The SSC is a group of teachers, parents and classified employees 
that work in collaboration with the ad
ministration to develop, review, and evaluate school improvement programs and school budgets. The members of 
the site council are generally elected by their peers.
 
 
Washington Elementary has an English Language Advisory Council (ELAC) which is a committee 
for parents or other community members who want to 
advocate for English Learners. The purpose is to advise the administration, school, staff, and the School Site Council (SSC) 
on programs and services for 
English Language Learners.
 
 
Coffee and Chat with th
e Principal is held monthly and all families are invited to attend.  During this time, parents/guardians are encouraged to sh
are 
suggestions and/or concerns. The principal also shares all the great programs that are taking place at school.
 
 
Parents make a 
difference at Washington. Parents are encouraged to volunteer on campus and in our classrooms. We have parents that have been
 

th st
aff and students. We 
enjoy having the additional adults on campus. Our students are very respectful to all our volunteers.
 
 
Our Administration has organized opportunities for parent workshops lead by school staff and consultants. We are excited to p
rovide 
the additional 
support structures designed to teach parents how to support students academically at home and to increase their personal know
ledge and skills regarding 
topics such as college and career readiness and technology. We are very fortunate to have
 
supportive and innovative resources for our parents.
 
 
 
State Priority: School Climate
 
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: School Climate (Priority 6):
 

 
Pupil suspension rates;
 

 
Pupil expulsion rates; and
 

 
Other local measures on the sense of safety.
 
 
School Safety Plan
 
Washington Elementary School

s school safety plan states that 

we will provide a safe, orderly, and secure environment conducive to learning; will create 
a school in which pupils will 
attend regularly and be safe from both physical and social
-
psychological harm; will develop a plan to work cooperatively and 
collaboratively with parents, pupils, teachers, administrators, counselors and community agencies, including law enforcement,
 
to pr
ovide a safe and 
orderly school and neighborhood.

 
 
Our School Safety Plan is updated yearly. The plan was updated during the 2018
-
2019 school year. Our staff reviews, edits, and makes changes to the 
plan as needed. The plan is then presented to the School
 
Site Council for approval. The goal is to ensure a safe and non
-
violent school environment. 
Additional safety measures include:
 

 
Drills held for fire, earthquake, and/or secure campus scenarios (e.g. active shooter drill)
 

 
Staff members trained and assigned
 
specific responsibilities for emergency operations
 

 
School works in collaboration with the Sheriff's Department when conducting emergency drills and training the staff.
 

 
Washington's main entrance is being re
-
configurated in the Spring of 2020 to increase s
afety.
 

 
Perimeter fencing and security cameras
 

 
Identification and tracking procedure for visitors who may only enter the campus through the school office
 

 
Frequent and effective communication with district security
 

 
School communication system such as PA, wal
kie talkie and in
-
class telephones
 
Campus monitors, teachers, and administrators supervise and monitor student activity before, during and after school. Student
s are disciplined with 
dignity inside and outside of the classroom. 
 
 
PBIS (Positive Behavior In
terventions and Supports)
 
 
Along with the entire Lynwood School District, we have implemented the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) fr
