About the 
SARC
 
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state 
law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC 
contains information about the condition and performance of each 
California public school. Under the Local 
Control Funding Formula (LCFF) 
all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control 
and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet 
annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to ad
dress 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be 
consistent with data reported in the SARC.
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California 
Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
. 
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web 
page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
. 
 

 
For additional information 
about the school, parents/guardians and 
community members should contact the school principal or the 
district office.

School 
Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
Macy School Facility Profile
 
 
Built in 1957, Macy Elementary School has five main wings of classrooms first through sixth grade, which also includes the li
brary, two computer labs, 
the Assista
nce Room, and three special education rooms.  The Macy Kindergartens are connected to the main office building and the teache

but are designed to have their own privacy and Kindergarten play area.  Five separate bungalows make
-
up the remainder of
 
the classrooms that are not 
attached to the main wings.  A permanent, three
-
room bungalow houses the school psychologist, the speech and language therapist, and the Macy 
Conference Room.  Macy has a full
-
functioning kitchen with an attached multi
-
purpose 
room that converts into a meeting hall or cafeteria with minimal 
effort.  The district also operates a fee
-
based, before and after school, daycare program called OPTIONS, which is located in front of the campus, on our 
southeast corner.
 
 
All major facility
 
projects have been completed including, exterior and interior painting.  The outside of the school was repainted in two
-
tone blue and 
ivory.  Touch
-
up paintwork to the Macy campus is completed annually.  Work orders given to the maintenance department are
 
prioritized and handled 
quickly and effectively, (within a same day to month turn
-
around).  The LJSD maintenance department takes pride in their work and it shows.
 
 
The 2016 Macy FIT (Fitness Inspection Tool) reports that the facilities are in 'Fair Repai
r.'

the 
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general 
education population and the California Alternate Assessments 
[CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given 
in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only
 
eligible students 
may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are 
aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with 
the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most 
significant cognitive disabilities); 
and
 
 

 
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses 
that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of 
California and the California State University, or career technical

Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-

Macy Elementary School values the home
-
school component of our campus life.  At Macy, parents and extended relations of our students regularly help 
on campus.  These volunteers allow Mac
y to sustain the programs and activities of our school.  Families at Macy understand that it is the partnership 
between home and school which creates a strong and positive learning environment and when augmented by the expertise and cari
ng of the teachers 
and staff at school, we are able to ensure a safe and industrious learning environment for our children.
 
 
The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) Executive Board works closely with the principal to set the goals of programming at Macy
.  Parents participate in
 
numerous committees and chair positions.  PTA members hold positions as active, contributing members of the Macy Elementary S
chool Site Council.  
PTA Executive Board liaisons accompany the principal to district level information meetings where parent feed
back is held in high regard; especially when 
it helps promote our programming and school activities.  On any given day, a visitor to Macy will find numerous volunteers wo
rking in classrooms or on 
campus to help accomplish our goals for the week, the month,
 
and the year.
 
 
Among other things, the Macy PTA runs the following events and programs during the year: Macy Trunk or Treat, Macy Reflection

Yearbook, Macy Family Nights (i.e. Angel Night, Duck Night, Movie Night), Macy Kindergarten Picnic
, Junior Achievement, Science Olympiad, fall and 

-
of
-
the
-

assemblies, and class field trips.  All parents and friends of Mac
y are encouraged to become involved in the PTA.  Further event and calendar information, 
including PTA membership registration, can be found at Macy.LJSD.org.
 
 
Parents are also important members of school support programs such as Noon Duty Aide supervision
 
and the volunteers who assist in the library and the 
computer lab.

School Safety Plan
 
Macy School Site Council Review of Safety Plan: January 2020
 
Macy NIMS (National Incident Management System) Reviewed with site personnel: October 2019
 
 
At Macy we believe that all 
students have right to learn in a safe and secure environment.  In order to ensure student safety, Macy has drafted a School 
Safety Plan.  This safety plan includes Macy's National Incident Management System (NIMS) which provides an organized respons
e to a
 
variety of incidents 
including major incidents such as: fire; earthquake, and lockdowns.  It outlines a school emergency response team and include
s organizational charts 
with responsibilities and duty descriptions for school personnel.  Our Safety Plan al
so includes the use of CatapultEMS. All staff at Macy have been trained 
on CatapultEMS to ensure a dedicated emergency communication system that is clear and connected all times with the school saf
ety team, our teachers, 
the district, and law enforcement.
 
 
The School Safety Plan, in addition to the NIMS, also includes an alternate location for students and staff to relocate to in
 
the event the campus is not 
inhabitable.  It also contains contact information of various emergency agencies such as local police
 
and fire departments.
