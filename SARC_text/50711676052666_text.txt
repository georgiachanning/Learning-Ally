By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Contr
ol Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address
 
state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data 
reported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg
/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons 
of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learn
ers).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Othe
r use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description and 
Mission Statement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Enslen School was built in 1929 and recently celebrated its 90th year. It is located on a shady, tree
-
lined campus in an 
established neighborhood near the center of Modesto. The staff, parents, students, and commun
ity have a long
-
standing 
sense of "family" and pride for their school. Enslen has focused on developing and implementing educational programs 
that are responsive to the needs of students in an ever
-
 
changing world. Teachers, parents and support staff colla
borate 
to provide a challenging and supportive environment for all students. The small school atmosphere lends itself well to 
fostering a rich, challenging learning climate and providing opportunities for children to develop emotionally, socially, and
 
phys
ically.
 
 
Enslen has earned the reputation of maintaining high academic expectations and providing a strong educational program. 
Many of our parents and some grandparents are former Enslen students, and they have deliberately located in the Enslen 
area so t
hat their descendants could continue the tradition of being Enslen graduates. Parents are actively involved and 
serve in leadership capacities through the Parent Involvement and Engagement Committee, English Language Parent 
Partnership, and the Parent Teac
her Club (PTC). Parent volunteers are visible daily, providing support and assistance 
throughout the school. Our educational environment and teaching strategies meet the goals and objectives of a strong 
curriculum. The Enslen faculty utilizes every opportu
nity for grade level collaboration centered on analyzing student 
assessment data and utilizing effective instructional strategies to meet the needs of our students.
 
 
Although Enslen is a small school with somewhat limited resources, the emphasis has been o
n utilizing funds to provide 

learning environment, and tradition of excellence are the products of partnerships between staff, students, an
d the 
community.

Student safety is discussed regularly at Staff meetings, Site council meetings, Parent Teacher Club meetings 
and Safety 
meetings. The school custodian checks the school grounds for safety each morning before the children arrive. Repairs are 
made quickly whenever safety issues are involved. Yard duty staff supervises the playground before school, after school, 
and
 
during recess. The gates are locked after school begins so that all visitors must come through the front door. A sign is 
posted at the door informing visitors to report to the office. Visitors sign in at the office and must put on a visitor badge

School Safety Plan (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
The district takes great efforts to ensure that all schools are clean, safe, and functional. To assist in this effort, the di
strict 
uses a facility survey instrument developed by the State of California Office of Public School Construction. The results of 
this survey are included within this report. The results of this survey are available at the district office and on the inter
net 
at mcs4kids.com.
 
 
Student safety is discussed regularly at Staff meetings, Parent Teacher Club meetings and Safety meetings. Th
e School 
Safety Plan is reviewed by the School Safety Team regularly.  The school custodian checks the school grounds for safety 
each morning before the children arrive. Repairs are made quickly whenever safety issues are involved. Yard duty staff 
supervis
es the playground before school, after school, and during recess. The gates are locked after school begins so that 
all visitors must come through the front door. A sign is posted at the door informing visitors to report to the office. Visit
ors 
sign in at t


that students may not be on
 
campus before 8:15 and must go home immediately after school for their own safety.
 
 
Below is more specific information on the condition of the school and the efforts made to ensure that students are 
provided with a clean, safe, and functional learning env
ironment.
 
 
Age of School/Buildings:

built in 1929. Additions were constructed in 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1959. Five portable 
classrooms were constructed over 
the periods of 1989, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002. The school opened in 1929.

Maintenance and Repair:
 
District maintenance staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good repair and working order are 
comp
leted in a timely manner. A work order process is used to ensure efficient service. Emergency repairs are given the 
highest priority. The school facility is in overall good repair.
 
 
Cleaning Process and Schedule:
 
The district governing board has adopted cl
eaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards 
are available at the school office, or at the district office. The Principal works continually with the custodial staff to de
velop 
cleaning schedules to ensure a clean and safe 
school.
 
 
Deferred Maintenance Budget:
 
The District participated in the State School Deferred Maintenance Program, which provided flexible state matching funds 
to assist school districts with expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing 
school facilities components. State 
contributions to this Program ended in the 2012
-
13 school year. Deferred Maintenance typically includes paving, roofing, 
plumbing, heating, air conditioning, electrical systems, interior or exterior painting and floor sy
stems.  For the 2015
-
16 
school year, the district has budgeted $1.35 million out of the District General Fund carry
-
over funds for deferred 
maintenance projects throughout the District.
 
 
The District also has 1.26 million of carry
-
over funds in Fund 14 Def
erred Maintenance Fund available for deferred 
maintenance projects throughout the District. Identified needed repairs are weighed against all other District site repairs 
and the most urgent repairs are addressed first.

Professional development in MCS is data driven using research
-
based best practices to ensure our students receive 
guaranteed and viable curriculum in every grade, in every school.    We 
use formative and summative data to drive our 
instructional decisions and focus for professional development.  To this end, we utilize multiple structures  to provide 
high
-
quality professional development to our staff including:  summer training, preservic
e
-
days, district wide professional 
development days, after school workshops, Saturday workshops, substitute
-
release days, instructional coaching, a BTSA 
and PAR program,  and most recently a 0.5% compensation package for those who choose to complete an ext
ra 6 hours 
of professional development.
 
 
MCS has prioritized our focus on mathematics, literacy across grades and content areas, collaboration, welcoming 
schools/customer service, and building our capacity as professionals.  This has been in addition to th
e needed training in 
new adoptions, curriculum and standard updates and the like.  The professional development is sustained through site 
administration, district and site level instructional coaches, and intervention specialists.  In the 2019
-
202 academic
 
year, 
a new division was also created in order to increase the quality and quantity of professional development provided to 
classified, certificated, and managers alike.
