By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School 
Accountability Report 
Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under 
the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Cont
rol and 
Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school
-
specific goals for all pupils, with 
specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with da
ta 
re
ported in the SARC.
 
 

 
For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/
.
 

 
For more informa
tion about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at 
https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/
.
 

 
For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should
 
contact the school 
principal or the district office.
 
 
DataQuest
 
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at 
https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/
 
that 
contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically,
 
DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, 
dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).
 
 
Internet Access
 
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State
 
Library). Access to the 
Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first
-
come, first
-
served basis. 
Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending 
on availability), the types of sof
tware programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

School Description:
 
 
Rancho Vista school can best be described as
 
a caring, supportive environment focused on student learning across the 
curriculum.  We recognize the impact that good school attendance, positive character choices and respectful behavior 
have on student achievement and work to make the connections with 
student achievement for our students.    We strive 
to inspire each child to reach their potential in all areas of the curriculum.  Rancho Vista Elementary School is located in 
the southwest portion of the Antelope Valley in the community of Palmdale.  It s
erves transitional kindergarten through 
sixth grade students, with an enrollment of approximately 825 students. In 2006 Rancho Vista was named a California 
Distinguished School, the first in the Westside Union School District.  In 2016 and 2017 Rancho Vist
a continued their 
achievement by being named a Star Honor Roll School.   Rancho Vista is operating as a permanent school site, although 
the school is mostly relocatable buildings.  There are currently 35 classrooms, a multi
-
purpose building, a library, and
 
an 
administration building.  Twenty
-
eight classrooms are currently being used as regular general education classrooms.  
Others include a computer lab, a staff workroom, a Resource Specialist classroom, a Speech classroom, a counselor room,  
K
-
3 Special Da
y Class, and a 4
-
6 Special Day Class.  There are currently no empty classrooms on the site.
 
 
Mission Statement:
 
 
The mission of Rancho Vista Elementary School is to provide opportunities for each student to achieve personal excellence 
while striving to mas
ter the state standards. Working as a school community, we will encourage each child to "reach for 
the stars" as we aim to create respectful citizens and lifelong learners.  This is also indicated in our student learner 
outcomes where we encourage students
 
to "reach for the STARS" through Scholarly work, Team work, Attitude, Rigor and 
Success for All.

School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements (Most Recent Year)
 
 
The students and staff at Rancho Vista are very proud of their beautiful school and grounds.  Our school, now twenty 
twoyears old, remains relatively free of graffiti and vandalism du
e to the school pride that exists here. The safety of the 
student body and staff is of major concern.  We maintain a secure campus whereby students are signed in and out through 
the office during school hours.  Visitors to our campus are required to sign i
n and out through the office. The walkways 
and playgrounds are monitored by classified and certificated staff.  The intercom is utilized to aid in communication and 
as an emergency alert (this was recently updated last year.)  Rancho Vista has a written di
saster preparedness plan and 
conducts monthly fire and/or earthquake drills.  The PTA provides safety supplies for each classroom in case of an 
emergency.  A safety committee composed of staff and parents meets monthly to ensure that the school campus 
cont
inues to be a safe environment. School facilities are kept clean and in good repair by the school custodians and the 
district Grounds and Maintenance Department.
 
 
District has installed new ADA ramps in kindergarten and two wings of the school.

Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site.
 
 
Opportunities for Parental Involvement (School Year 2019
-
20)
 
 
Many opportunities exist for 
parent involvement in the Westside Union School District and at Rancho Vista School. Parent 
involvement hours, most of which are spent in the classroom, average over 7,000 hours/year.  We are proud of our strong 
parent partnerships and recognize the import
ance of parental support.  Rancho Vista has an active PTA which supports 
academic field trips and assemblies in addition to activities that promote a positive school culture.   Our school also reach
es 
out to parents through our Latino Literacy/ ELAC and th

Types of Services Funded (Fiscal Year 2018

A range of academic and social emotional supports exist for Westside students, many of which are unique to individual 
school sites, 
tailored to meet the needs of the members of each school community.  Many of these supports are provided 
by counselors (district and/or community
-
based), school psychologists, school nurses, specialists in 
Speech/Language/Hearing, adaptive physical educati
on teachers, or behavior specialists.
 
 
Student Study and Child Study Teams assist students experiencing academic and/or social emotional challenges, those 
with special needs, and with assessing eligibility for placement in special classes and/or recommendi
ng specialized services 
as needed. Special services and classes are offered for students with learning disabilities as well as other students with 
exceptional needs.
 
 
Twelve counselors provide a range of support services for Westside students.  Programs an
d services are developed and 
provided based on student data (such as referrals for threatening or self
-
harm behaviors and academic intervention 
letters) and the needs of the school site.  Often these programs build upon the skills and habits of mind that a
re nurtured 
and developed in Leadership Development through Physical Education (LDTPE), AVID, and Boys Town.  Examples of 
counseling programs include specific groups for strong
-
willed students, grief groups, groups for students who are 
exhibiting signs and
 
behaviors due to trauma, academic organization groups (addressing academic organization of 
assignments, goals, and expectations), and community outreach and service clubs such as Student Ambassadors or 
Kindness Club. School counselors are assisted by a ca
dre of Campus Climate Assistants, highly trained paraprofessionals 
who provide social emotional support and structure for students during more unstructured parts of the school day like 
recess and lunch. Counselors and Educational Service staff members coll
aborate regularly with community agencies to 
facilitate alignment and coordination of resources and supports for students and their families.
 
 
The district continues to collaborate with the Department of Mental Health to coordinate with local mental health
 
agencies to provide School Based Mental Health services at all school sites for eligible students.
 
 
Behavior specialists provide student and staff support for students needing intensive behavior support and/or 
intervention.
 
 
Bilingual paraprofessional sup
port staff provide assistance in the classroom for English Learners. Bilingual assistants 
receive ongoing professional development in the areas of strategies to support students learning English within the 
classroom; review of district wide academic progra
ms supporting English Learners; specialized language practice used for 
translation during parent/teacher conferences; protocols for English Learner identification; and criteria for student 
reclassification.

Several programs, designed to build 
students' emotional intelligence and capacity and to promote positive and proactive 
social decision making, reduce bullying, and build an inclusive culture continue to be implemented districtwide. Two of 
these are BoysTown (implemented in grades Kindergart
en through 8) and Leadership Development through Physical 
Education for students in grades 4, 5, and 6.
 
 
A variety of online mathematics (i.e. Big Brains and ALEKS) and reading intervention (i.e. FastForWord) programs are 
accessible for students.  In addit
ion to being used during the school day, students can also access these programs from 
home.  These online interventions are site
-
specific.
 
 
A variety of extended learning opportunities like before/after school tutoring and/or lunchtime Learning Lab support
 
were 
offered at all sites.  Learning Labs provide support with homework and opportunities for collaborative learning sessions.  
Tutoring may provide review of foundational skills, frontloading of key skills and concepts, and/or homework assistance.  
Five 
days of intersession support is provided for middle school students during each spring and summer intersession.  An 
Extended School Year program is available during the first part of summer intersession for those students with disabilities 
who qualify.  A 
traditional district wide summer school program was on hold for the summer of 2018 due to significant 
maintenance and repairs at school sites. In lieu of the summer school program for elementary students, optional 
interactive Summer Learning Kits were purc
hased for parents and caregivers to use with their students over the summer 
intersession. The Kits contained games, tools, and materials to sharpen and support reading, writing, and math skills.  
Additionally, the district offered its third summer KinderCa
mp during the summer.  The three
-
day experience was designed 
to provide an opportunity for incoming Kindergarteners and their parents to learn about Kindergarten expectations in a 
day camp

type environment.

The goal of professional 
learning is to provide staff members the support that they need to meet the diverse educational 
needs of Westside students. The key area of focus for professional development and support for the 2018
-
2019 school 
year was the use of assessment data, particu
larly common formative assessment data, to guide and inform instruction.
 
 
Teachers, classified instructional classroom support staff, and site administrators are provided four days of professional 
development each year. These days are calendared work days.
  
For all groups, two of the days are dedicated to issues and 
needs related specifically to our English Learners, foster youth, or other at
-
risk students.  For teachers and site 
administrators, two of the four days are devoted to building their capacity to
 
use data, particularly formative assessment 
data, to inform instruction.  For classified instructional staff, two days were devoted a to a variety of topics including 
trauma
-
informed support for at
-
risk youth; BoysTown; Leadership Development through Phys
ical Education; and meeting 
the academic needs of students with exceptional needs.
 
 
Teachers are also encouraged to engage in optional professional learning opportunities that relate to their specific 
teaching assignment. Teachers are compensated at a cont
ractual hourly rate for their participation in these sessions.
 
 
Similar opportunities are provided for our site administrators.  Most regularly attend applicable ACSA Academies.  70% of

district has developed a robust system for new teacher support including 1:1 support, Professional Learning Communities 
(PLCs), and direct classroom support. New teachers are assigned a men
tor/coach dependent upon their credential status. 
Support providers, mentors, and coaches in the program are veteran teachers who have been released full
-
time from their 
classroom responsibilities.  Every new teacher is supported weekly at their site by th
eir mentor/coach with the focus of 
support being aligned to their goal and individual support plan.  Full time administrators/coaches also support the pre
-
interns and interns based upon the requirements of their university's memorandum of understanding and
 
the 
requirements of the CTC.  The pre
-
intern and intern teachers participate in biweekly professional development based 
upon the district initiatives as well as their unique developmental needs.  Teachers holding a Preliminary credential are 
supported by 
teachers on special assignment who serve as full time Support Providers.  Those holding a Preliminary 
credential attend a series of six professional development opportunities specially designed and aligned with the California 
Standards for the Teaching Pro
fession (CSTPs). For veteran teachers needing additional support, the Peer Assistance and 
Review (PAR) program is designed to improve the education of students by providing opportunities for additional training 
for all teachers.
