Activities reflect the school's\rgoals and objectives and are part of Loma Verde's School Plan for Student Achievement.  Staff development topics for  2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19\rincluded a focus on literacy with an emphasis on comprehension, vocabulary development, full implementation of the Benchmark Advanced language\rarts program, social emotional learning, and mathematics.  All primary teachers received extensive literacy training with a focus on expository reading\rand writing on the California Content Standards.  Teachers attended specialized training in areas determined by teachers and the principal as part of\rtheir professional growth.  All teachers continue to receive training on how to utilize the California Content Standards to ensure mastery for all children.\r\rStaff Development topics are detailed more fully below and included:\r\r1.Writing,  with an emphasis on reading comprehension and vocabulary development.  Teachers received training on the writing framework -\rStep Up To Writing, the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Units of Study. The Data Team  (DT) and all teachers have been trained\rin the implementation of the Gradual Release of Responsibility model of instruction with an emphasis in the focus lesson/modeling.  During\rthe 2018-2019 school year, teachers consistently used Illuminate data to develop action plans when planning to ensure the academic success\rof all students.\r\r2.Reading Comprehension.  Loma Verde staff was trained in and continues to develop an understanding of the components of reading\rcomprehension utilizing the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention.  Loma Verde staff works closely with district resource teachers to\rconsistently fine-tune teaching skills in the area of reading comprehension and writing.  The Instructional Leadership Team continues to work\rwith the district cohort to develop a deeper understanding of instructional techniques that lead to higher levels of student engagement and\rproductivity.  At Loma Verde, we consistently monitor student achievement with Illuminate data.  Professional development in analyzing the\rdata and planning for instructional programs is a critical part of our ongoing learning.\r\r3.Deconstructing the Standards, Understanding and Analyzing Student Data, Expository Writing, Reading Comprehension for English Learners -\rIn order to ensure students are closing the achievement gap, our teachers engage in grade level discussion over the importance of teaching\rour students essential standards they need to learn to be successful in their current grade level, to help them in future grade levels, and to\rprepare them to compete and succeed in college and in their future careers.  An important aspect of our students' success has to do with\rassessing our students' learning.  Teachers use this information (or data) to prepare lessons that will challenge students to continue to achieve\rand to intervene with students who need additional support.  We believe our students need to learn to be creative writers.  For this reason,\rour teachers dedicate three hours to literacy with a focus on the read-write connection during which time our students learn to write and make\rconnections with the texts they read.  Our teachers receive training on Guided Language Acquisition Design strategies with an end in mind - to\rteach ALL students, including English Learners, to be high-achieving students.\r\r4.Social Emotional Learning is a focus of our school this year.  We are in the third year of our PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Supports) for\rour school.  Teachers continue to receive support with Restorative Practices, Second Step, and Sanford Harmony Curriculum to help deepen\rstudents self-efficacy.  ... Unnamed: 6

Activities reflect the school's\rgoals and objectives and are part of Loma Verde's School Plan for Student Achievement.  Staff development topics for  2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19\rincluded a focus on literacy with an emphasis on comprehension, vocabulary development, full implementation of the Benchmark Advanced language\rarts program, social emotional learning, and mathematics.  All primary teachers received extensive literacy training with a focus on expository reading\rand writing on the California Content Standards.  Teachers attended specialized training in areas determined by teachers and the principal as part of\rtheir professional growth.  All teachers continue to receive training on how to utilize the California Content Standards to ensure mastery for all children.\r\rStaff Development topics are detailed more fully below and included:\r\r1.Writing,  with an emphasis on reading comprehension and vocabulary development.  Teachers received training on the writing framework -\rStep Up To Writing, the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Units of Study. The Data Team  (DT) and all teachers have been trained\rin the implementation of the Gradual Release of Responsibility model of instruction with an emphasis in the focus lesson/modeling.  During\rthe 2018-2019 school year, teachers consistently used Illuminate data to develop action plans when planning to ensure the academic success\rof all students.\r\r2.Reading Comprehension.  Loma Verde staff was trained in and continues to develop an understanding of the components of reading\rcomprehension utilizing the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention.  Loma Verde staff works closely with district resource teachers to\rconsistently fine-tune teaching skills in the area of reading comprehension and writing.  The Instructional Leadership Team continues to work\rwith the district cohort to develop a deeper understanding of instructional techniques that lead to higher levels of student engagement and\rproductivity.  At Loma Verde, we consistently monitor student achievement with Illuminate data.  Professional development in analyzing the\rdata and planning for instructional programs is a critical part of our ongoing learning.\r\r3.Deconstructing the Standards, Understanding and Analyzing Student Data, Expository Writing, Reading Comprehension for English Learners -\rIn order to ensure students are closing the achievement gap, our teachers engage in grade level discussion over the importance of teaching\rour students essential standards they need to learn to be successful in their current grade level, to help them in future grade levels, and to\rprepare them to compete and succeed in college and in their future careers.  An important aspect of our students' success has to do with\rassessing our students' learning.  Teachers use this information (or data) to prepare lessons that will challenge students to continue to achieve\rand to intervene with students who need additional support.  We believe our students need to learn to be creative writers.  For this reason,\rour teachers dedicate three hours to literacy with a focus on the read-write connection during which time our students learn to write and make\rconnections with the texts they read.  Our teachers receive training on Guided Language Acquisition Design strategies with an end in mind - to\rteach ALL students, including English Learners, to be high-achieving students.\r\r4.Social Emotional Learning is a focus of our school this year.  We are in the third year of our PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention Supports) for\rour school.
