Early student dismissal on Wednesdays also provides teachers an additional 90 minutes each week to collaborate and articulate with other\rgrade-level teachers in professional learning communities.\r\rThe administration fully supports all staff development with fiscal and personnel resources and personal participation. Staff training is consistent with\rthe school goals for curriculum, instruction and assessment for improved student achievement. The curriculum and instruction department offers\radditional trainings and in-services throughout the year.\r\rOver the past several years, there has been a focus on meeting the students’ social emotional needs as well as academics. Recent professional\rdevelopment has centered around early childhood trauma and its effects on the brain. Valley Oak is in the initial stages of becoming a trauma informed\rschool.\r\rValley Oak has also received training in Kagan Cooperative Learning Strategies in grades 1-6. These strategies taught to the students increase the level of\rengagement of all students regardless of ability. Teach-ers have reported that students are more engaged and are working closely with students they\rmight not normally have worked with.\r\rThrough the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) funding, a teacher on special assignment works with our staff in the area of technology and comes\ron site to work with students and teachers to utilize the many technologies available to them. Our Clovis West area has also hired a transition counselor\rand learning director to assist students in the transition from elementary to middle school. Each school has a dedicated person who works two days a\rweek—or more as needed—with our students who do not have a support system at home, mentoring them to be on the path to college. These individuals\rwork with the students in goal setting and building a trusting relationship with another adult on campus who cares about their progress and emotional\rwell-being.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

Early student dismissal on Wednesdays also provides teachers an additional 90 minutes each week to collaborate and articulate with other\rgrade-level teachers in professional learning communities.\r\rThe administration fully supports all staff development with fiscal and personnel resources and personal participation. Staff training is consistent with\rthe school goals for curriculum, instruction and assessment for improved student achievement. The curriculum and instruction department offers\radditional trainings and in-services throughout the year.\r\rOver the past several years, there has been a focus on meeting the students’ social emotional needs as well as academics. Recent professional\rdevelopment has centered around early childhood trauma and its effects on the brain. Valley Oak is in the initial stages of becoming a trauma informed\rschool.\r\rValley Oak has also received training in Kagan Cooperative Learning Strategies in grades 1-6. These strategies taught to the students increase the level of\rengagement of all students regardless of ability. Teach-ers have reported that students are more engaged and are working closely with students they\rmight not normally have worked with.\r\rThrough the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) funding, a teacher on special assignment works with our staff in the area of technology and comes\ron site to work with students and teachers to utilize the many technologies available to them. Our Clovis West area has also hired a transition counselor\rand learning director to assist students in the transition from elementary to middle school. Each school has a dedicated person who works two days a\rweek—or more as needed—with our students who do not have a support system at home, mentoring them to be on the path to college. These individuals\rwork with the students in goal setting and building a trusting relationship with another adult on campus who cares about their progress and emotional\rwell-being.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...
