Training is available\rthrough three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release days and during the\rsummer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the implementation of our\radopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities integrate content\rdevelopment and research-based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and\rSocio-economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research from the\rCalifornia State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in language and literacy,\rscience and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards and strategies to support\rconceptual understanding and improve student learning.\r\rTeachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learning communities within and\racross sites and in departments or grade levels - both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district-level training with site-based\rprofessional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed professional learning opportunities by\revaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and feedback surveys) from teacher\rand leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strategies during the year. We also\revaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on-going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District\rleadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for student successes and\rchallenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then informs the district’s LCAP and each site’s\rSPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade-level and classroom data),\rwhere they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month-to-month adjustments in professional learning\rstrategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union representatives to elicit their\rfeedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the district LCAP. Additionally,\rstarting this year, SMFCSD will gather once-a-year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current\rstrategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.\r\rOur beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District-based Induction program. Veteran teachers can\rparticipate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.  ... Unnamed: 6

Training is available\rthrough three professional development days, staff meetings, scheduled release times during the school year, on early release days and during the\rsummer. Our primary focus for professional development is aligning instruction to meet the California State Standards and the implementation of our\radopted materials for mathematics and English Language Arts/English Language development. Professional learning opportunities integrate content\rdevelopment and research-based instructional practices to meet the needs of all learners, especially English Learners, Students with Disabilities and\rSocio-economically Disadvantaged. Professional Development in SMFCSD is grounded in the California State Standards and the research from the\rCalifornia State Adopted ELA/ELD, Mathematics and NGSS Frameworks. Elementary teachers have the opportunity for training in language and literacy,\rscience and mathematics. Middle School teachers receive subject specific professional development on the California Standards and strategies to support\rconceptual understanding and improve student learning.\r\rTeachers engage in a variety of Professional Development structures including, site or department specific PD, teacher learning communities within and\racross sites and in departments or grade levels - both in large and small groups. Our district also coordinates district-level training with site-based\rprofessional development opportunities based on site data. Over the last year, district and site leaders developed professional learning opportunities by\revaluating and adjusting our professional growth strategies, first by gathering immediate feedback (e.g., exit tickets and feedback surveys) from teacher\rand leader training and collaboration sessions. This data was then used to adjust and focus training and collaboration strategies during the year. We also\revaluate and adjust professional growth strategies through on-going examination of student performance data (academic and wellness). District\rleadership meets quarterly with school leaders to review current student data, to identify the professional growth causes for student successes and\rchallenges, to monitor the impact of key professional growth strategies and to plan forward. This work then informs the district’s LCAP and each site’s\rSPSA. In parallel with this work, site leaders lead the same process with teacher teams using more specific data (e.g. grade-level and classroom data),\rwhere they couple that data with teacher reflections on their professional learning and plan month-to-month adjustments in professional learning\rstrategies and yearly adjustments in their SPSAs. District leaders also lead a similar process with SMFCSD teacher union representatives to elicit their\rfeedback on the district professional growth strategies and to get their recommendations for strategy adjustments in the district LCAP. Additionally,\rstarting this year, SMFCSD will gather once-a-year survey feedback from teachers on their professional learning needs and on their experience of current\rstrategies which will inform yearly adjustments to LCAP and SPSA professional growth strategies.\r\rOur beginning teachers also receive additional professional development provided by our District-based Induction program. Veteran teachers can\rparticipate in a Peer Assistance Review (PAR) program for individual support.  ... Unnamed: 11
