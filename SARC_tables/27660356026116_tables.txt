We are located in Greenfield,\rCalifornia in South Monterey County. In addition to providing a safe, nurturing, and positive\renvironment, Mary Chapa is continuously revisiting, refining and re-teaching best practices\rto drive instruction to its highest levels. Our schoolwide initiatives include: Positive Behavior\rInterventions and Supports (PBIS), Arts Integration through a collaboration with Turnaround\rArts: California, Stemscopes Science Exploration Kits, and developing all students to be\r21st Century College and Career Ready through Common Core State Standards and the\rintegration of technology. As a district, we have also begun our partnership with LEGO\rEducation and have a new LEGO Innovation Lab right on campus!\rTeachers in grades 3-6 in English Language Arts and Mathematics align teaching and formative and summative\rassessments to Smarter Balanced and Common Core State Standards. Our grade levels meet and receive\rprofessional development training weekly. Based on grade-level short term goals, weekly grade-level and\rProfessional Learning Community (PLC) meetings, teachers analyze data results from Common Formative\rAssessments (CFA). Progress monitoring takes place through grade level collaboration sessions and information\ris shared with all team members via Google Drive.\rMary Chapa received an initiative from the Turnaround Arts: California to embed the arts into all Common Core\rcurricular areas. Students receive instruction from our full-time Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teacher in the\rarea of visual arts. The common area of the school has been converted into an art gallery, and all students have\rthe opportunity to participate in a Disney Spring Musical.  During the 2019-2020 school year, we will be performing,\r“A Jungle Book:Kids!”\rAll classrooms are equipped with a Promethean/Smart Board and a document camera. Laptops are available in\rall classrooms for grades at a ratio of nearly 1:1. Technology is used by teachers to support instruction, give\ronline assessments, provide intervention, and engage students in learning, including coding through LEGO\rEducation.\rIn accordance with Proposition 98, every school in California is required to issue an annual School Accountability\rReport Card. However, we view this as not only a means of complying with state legislature, but as an opportunity\rto keep our community well informed. We desire to keep the lines of communication open and welcome any\rsuggestions, comments, or questions you may have. It is the opinion of the district, myself in particular, that a\rwell-informed public is vital in continuing to advance in an ever-evolving world.\rDr. Eusebio Martinez, Principal\rdistriCt & sChool\rStudent Enrollment by\rd\rSubgroup/Grade LevelesCription\r2018-19\rGreenfield Union School District is located in the heart of the\rSalinas Valley, approximately 135 miles south of San Francisco.% of Total# of\rThe city is surrounded by a rich agricultural area producing aStudent GroupEnrollmentGrade LevelStudents\rlarge portion of the nation’s fruits and vegetables.
