In all of these venues, information regarding the development and efficacy of the curriculum and instruction are\rshared. The school continues to explore ways to encourage more parental and community involvement in the support of its educational program.\rPAC meetings have the ELAC wrapped in and are offered 6 times a year.  Parents and stakeholders are encouraged to participate in the development\rof the Local Control and Accountability Plan, and they are asked to provide input on the progress of the LCAP throughout the year.\rContact Information\rParents or community members who wish to participate in leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or become a volunteer may\rcontact Vista Norte Public Charter at (909) 509-5496.\rState Priority: Pupil Engagement\rThe SARC provides the following information relevant to the Pupil Engagement State Priority (Priority5):\r• High school dropout rates\r• High school graduation rates\rDropout & Graduation Rates\rIn knowing the “at risk of dropping out” status of the majority of students enrolling in the school, we begin interventions from the point of enrollment.\rUpon enrollment, students participate in a course entitled Professional Skills. In this course students learn study skills and strategies to be more\rsuccessful in school, especially in the area of time management. We believe students are less likely to dropout if they have an ideas of the career\ropportunities available to them..\rStudents also participate in academic assessments, such as NWEA, after enrollment. The academic assessments assist faculty and the students\rto understand the strengths and weaknesses of the student. More importantly, this method helps students receive any remedial help they may need\rand ensures students are not enrolling in courses to far removed from their current academic abilities. Unlimited free tutoring availability also serves\ras an intervention for students, when they struggle with particular concepts. Together, all of early interventions are intended to promote attendance\rand reduce the likelihood of student drop outs. However, these standard interventions are not always met with student success.\rWhen faculty and staff at (school) witness a decline in the attendance of a particular student, more specific and targeted interventions take place in\rprogressive steps:\r• A missed day of school results in a call home from the student’s teacher\r• A pattern of missed school days results in a parent-teacher or adult student-teacher conference\r• A continued pattern of missed schools days after a teacher conference results in an Attendance Intervention Meeting (A.I.M).  In this meeting\rthe parent or adult student meet with the Student Retention Specialist to discuss the legal requirements of school attendance for minors and\rproblems adults face as high school drop outs.\r• A continued pattern of missed school days after an A.I.M. intervention is escalated to a Student Retention Meeting (S.R.S) intervention.  Student\rRetention Meetings include the School Counselor, School Administrator, and the Student Retention Specialist.  When the student and parent\rmeet with the S.R.S team. Serious conversations take place about the appropriateness of independent study for the student, school options, and\rthe serious long-term consequences of dropping out of school\rThe most recent data available is from the 2017-18 school year. Because the school opened in the fall of 2018, there is no data to report in\rthis section for the school.\rState Priority: School Climate\rThe SARC provides the following information relevant to the School Climate State Priority (Priority 6):\r• Pupil suspension rates\r• Pupil expulsion rates\r• Other local measures on the sense of safety\rSuspensions & Expulsions\rSuspensions & Expulsions\rThe table displays the suspension and expulsion rates at the school, in the district,\rSuspensionsExpulsions\rand throughout the state.

Involvement\rThe SARC provides the following information relevant to the Parental Involvement State Priority (Priority 3):\r• Efforts the school district makes to seek parent input in making decisions for the school district and each school site\rParent & Community Involvement (School Year 2019-20)\rVista Norte Public Charter utilizes a number of strategies to increase parental involvement, including school open houses, back-to-school nights, a\rquarterly school newsletter, volunteer opportunities in the classroom and field trips, and quarterly Parental Advisory Council (PAC) and English Learner\rAdvisory Council (ELAC) meetings. In all of these venues, information regarding the development and efficacy of the curriculum and instruction are\rshared. The school continues to explore ways to encourage more parental and community involvement in the support of its educational program.\rPAC meetings have the ELAC wrapped in and are offered 6 times a year.  Parents and stakeholders are encouraged to participate in the development\rof the Local Control and Accountability Plan, and they are asked to provide input on the progress of the LCAP throughout the year.\rContact Information\rParents or community members who wish to participate in leadership teams, school committees, school activities, or become a volunteer may\rcontact Vista Norte Public Charter at (909) 509-5496.\rState Priority: Pupil Engagement\rThe SARC provides the following information relevant to the Pupil Engagement State Priority (Priority5):\r• High school dropout rates\r• High school graduation rates\rDropout & Graduation Rates\rIn knowing the “at risk of dropping out” status of the majority of students enrolling in the school, we begin interventions from the point of enrollment.\rUpon enrollment, students participate in a course entitled Professional Skills. In this course students learn study skills and strategies to be more\rsuccessful in school, especially in the area of time management. We believe students are less likely to dropout if they have an ideas of the career\ropportunities available to them..\rStudents also participate in academic assessments, such as NWEA, after enrollment. The academic assessments assist faculty and the students\rto understand the strengths and weaknesses of the student. More importantly, this method helps students receive any remedial help they may need\rand ensures students are not enrolling in courses to far removed from their current academic abilities. Unlimited free tutoring availability also serves\ras an intervention for students, when they struggle with particular concepts. Together, all of early interventions are intended to promote attendance\rand reduce the likelihood of student drop outs. However, these standard interventions are not always met with student success.\rWhen faculty and staff at (school) witness a decline in the attendance of a particular student, more specific and targeted interventions take place in\rprogressive steps:\r• A missed day of school results in a call home from the student’s teacher\r• A pattern of missed school days results in a parent-teacher or adult student-teacher conference\r• A continued pattern of missed schools days after a teacher conference results in an Attendance Intervention Meeting (A.I.M).  In this meeting\rthe parent or adult student meet with the Student Retention Specialist to discuss the legal requirements of school attendance for minors and\rproblems adults face as high school drop outs.\r• A continued pattern of missed school days after an A.I.M. intervention is escalated to a Student Retention Meeting (S.R.S) intervention.  Student\rRetention Meetings include the School Counselor, School Administrator, and the Student Retention Specialist.  When the student and parent\rmeet with the S.R.S team. Serious conversations take place about the appropriateness of independent study for the student, school options, and\rthe serious long-term consequences of dropping out of school\rThe most recent data available is from the 2017-18 school year. Because the school opened in the fall of 2018, there is no data to report in\rthis section for the school.\rState Priority: School Climate\rThe SARC provides the following information relevant to the School Climate State Priority (Priority 6):\r• Pupil suspension rates\r• Pupil expulsion rates\r• Other local measures on the sense of safety\rSuspensions & Expulsions\rSuspensions & Expulsions\rThe table displays the suspension and expulsion rates at the school, in the district,\rSuspensionsExpulsions\rand throughout the state.
