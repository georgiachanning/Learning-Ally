The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of eachCalifornia public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all Local Educational Agencies(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intendto meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities.Additionally, data reported in a LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.• For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARCwebpage at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/.• For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF Webpage athttp://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/.• For additional information about the school, parents and community members should contact the schoolprincipal or the district office.DataQuestDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the county,and the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., testdata, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding Englishlearners).School Mission StatementThe school’s mission is to provide students seeking an alternative school setting with a personalized approachto learning that empowers them to take responsibility for their education and to graduate with the skills theyneed to become responsible citizens and lifelong learners.In order to carry out this mission, the school strives to equip the surrounding area students with the educationalskills necessary in the 21st century – the ability to read, write, speak, and calculate with clarity and precisionand the ability to participate intelligently and responsibly in a global society. The school offers alternativechoices through site-based learning, independent study, and distance learning to enable students to acquirethe knowledge necessary to make a difference in their lives.The school provides a diverse, student-centered environment in which all students are held to high academicand behavioral standards. Students work in collaborative relationships, both within and outside the school,and perform service to the community. Through a personalized learning approach to education, the schoolstrives to develop students who are competent, self-motivated, life-long learners. In order to accomplish this,the school emphasizes increased parental involvement, more one-on-one teacher and student interaction,attention to differences in learning styles, student-driven participation in developing the learning process,technology access, varied learning environments, teacher and parent development programs, and choices incurriculum programs.The school places a strong emphasis on parental involvement within the learning process. Parents are viewedas an essential link in improving education; therefore, parents are encouraged to take part in their children’seducation through frequent communication with the teachers, participation in school related functions, andattendance in school sponsored parent development workshops. By providing a vehicle for meaningfulparental involvement, the school strives to bridge the gap between school and home. It is the hope of theschool that students will observe first-hand their parents and teachers working together to make a differencein their education and future.School Profile (School Year 2019-20)Kings Valley Academy II opened in the fall of 2017. It is a public charter school that offers a personalizededucational program for high school students and families who prefer using an Independent Study model tomeet academic needs. Typical students are those who have become dissatisfied with the quality of educationthey are receiving in the local public school systems. Students come to the school because they wereunsuccessful in the traditional high school setting or they needed a more personalized approach to education.]
