All of these services are coordinated by the district management team and support the\reducational programs in the district.\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and thecounty. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

All of these services are coordinated by the district management team and support the\reducational programs in the district.\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and thecounty. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

All of these services are coordinated by the district management team and support the\reducational programs in the district.\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and thecounty. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

All of these services are coordinated by the district management team and support the\reducational programs in the district.\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and thecounty. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

All of these services are coordinated by the district management team and support the\reducational programs in the district.\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and thecounty. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.
