El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class. Staff development is provided to focus on how to teach and integrate STEAM subject matter, and how to make it relevant and engaging for\rour students to learn.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$6,390$631$5759$86,027\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-33.01.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-26.310.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level.

The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class. Staff development is provided to focus on how to teach and integrate STEAM subject matter, and how to make it relevant and engaging for\rour students to learn.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$6,390$631$5759$86,027\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-33.01.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-26.310.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level.

The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class. Staff development is provided to focus on how to teach and integrate STEAM subject matter, and how to make it relevant and engaging for\rour students to learn.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$6,390$631$5759$86,027\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-33.01.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-26.310.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level.

Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level. As a professional learning community, we evaluate and revise our mission statement, create and update curriculum, and focus on\rstudent goals each year. Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) is embraced by the staff as they engage in lessons and challenges with\rtheir class. Staff development is provided to focus on how to teach and integrate STEAM subject matter, and how to make it relevant and engaging for\rour students to learn.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$6,390$631$5759$86,027\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-33.01.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-26.310.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level.

El Portal’s staff is constantly seeking ways to\rimprove our programs. Our staff has received ongoing training in reading comprehension strategies for the last couple years.  This year our staff\rdevelopment has been focused on the writing process. Several of our teachers have attended seminars in math, reading, and technology and have\rbrought the material back to the staff and presented at an in-service to the staff.  The staff has also received extensive training in working with our English\rLanguage Learners. All of our staff has been trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD). One afternoon each week is provided by the district\rfor the purpose of staff development.  Grade level teams meet on a regular basis to evaluate instructional strategies and to implement new methods to\rprovide the best possible instruction. One of El Portal’s many strengths is the team effort among the staff as they build a strong academic program at\reach grade level.
