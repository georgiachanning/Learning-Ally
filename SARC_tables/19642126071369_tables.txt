Staff\rmembers work collaboratively to determine the school's needs and take direction from District and State requirements when establishing professional\rdevelopment goals for the school year.\r\rSchool-wide training focus areas include writing, mathematics, and using data to drive instruction.  Instructional Learning Rounds provide demonstration\rlessons in classrooms and time for debriefing and discussion.  Our teachers meet weekly to collaborate on instructional practice.  This is sometimes as a\rstaff, and other times in grade-level teams.  Teachers also receive monthly grade-level planning time to look at progress monitoring data and the needs\rof their individual students.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$53,310$51,374School Site-527705276.6682321\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,353$80,151D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A6155$82,836.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$103,681$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$126,865$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$126,865$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$145,416$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$243,357$245,810\rSchool Site/District-15.4-6.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-34.7-4.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries38%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.
