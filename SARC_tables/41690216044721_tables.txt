Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$12,110$4,195$7,915$84,602\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,281$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-4.52.9\r\rSchool Site/ State5.326.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$12,110$4,195$7,915$84,602\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,281$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-4.52.9\r\rSchool Site/ State5.326.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$12,110$4,195$7,915$84,602\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,281$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-4.52.9\r\rSchool Site/ State5.326.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$12,110$4,195$7,915$84,602\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,281$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-4.52.9\r\rSchool Site/ State5.326.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$12,110$4,195$7,915$84,602\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,281$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-4.52.9\r\rSchool Site/ State5.326.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.
