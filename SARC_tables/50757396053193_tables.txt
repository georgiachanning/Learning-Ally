Multiple measures including CAASPP\rresults, CELDT achievement data, common formative assessments, and data from site educational rounds were utilized to prioritize needs. Additionally,\rTUSD’s initiatives and staff input continue to drive the professional development offerings.\rStaff is provided with weekly embedded collaboration time in addition to opportunities for extended collaboration at site determined periods throughout\rthe school year.  The collaboration time allows teachers to apply new learning and make strategic decisions regarding the use of curriculum and\rassessments.\r\rYear one and year two teachers are enrolled in TUSD’s Induction Program which is in the second year of implementation. The Induction Program activities\rare based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession which outlines the numerous interconnected skills that comprise the professional\rpractices of teaching. New administrators are supported through their participation in the Stanislaus County Office of Education Administrator Induction\rProgram.\r\rProfessional development and support has been provided in the following areas: Professional Learning Communities; Math Instruction; ELA/ELD\rInstruction; Special Education; Instructional Best Practices; Guided Language Acquisition and Design (GLAD); Advanced Placement;  Technology; Digital\rCitizenship, Small Group Instruction; and Next Generation Science Standards.
