Three professional development days are organized by the LLCSD\rEducational Services office.  This year, teachers were trained in Depth of Knowledge (DOK)and applying the rigor for each DOK level in their classrooms.\rIn addition, our science teachers continue to work with UCLA to refine lessons and provide real-world experiences for children.  Our math teachers work\rwith our district experts to refine learning experiences for children.  This assists our ongoing efforts to refine our instruction.  Moreover, our teachers\rregularly collaborate 2 days per week to design lessons and activities that are in alignment with Common Core state standards.  These lessons increase\rthe level of inquiry, collaboration, citing of textual evidence, primary source referencing, writing,  practical applications of content and critical reading.\rThese goals are further supported by our 1:1 ratio of Chromebooks in every classroom for every student.  Technology is integrated into all aspects of\rclassroom lessons to add depth to each activity.\r\rPrior to Common Core, Lake Center staff participated in a great deal of training in Effective Instruction.  Teachers were trained in the areas of “teaching\rto an objective,” “active participation,” and checking for understanding.” These three elements of effective instruction have become standard practice\rhere at Lake Center and have been naturally embedded into Common Core lessons.\r\rAs we move forward in 2019-2020, we continue to support our teachers through professional development.  Lake Center teachers regularly attend\rAdvancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) workshops where they further enhance their instructional delivery practices.  One of these practices\ris using Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and Reading (WICOR) across all subject matters.  During this school year, we are focusing on the\rWICOR strategies with particular emphasis on focused note taking, using notes as an instructional tool, and responding in writing about those notes or\rclass essential questions.  Our professional development activities and their implementation, are monitored through Data Reflection Sessions 5 times\rper year.  To help our teachers grow professionally as a team, Lake Center plans multiple site directed professional development sessions that cover such\rtopics as PBIS, Special Education, LCAP,  and the concept of rigor/depth of knowledge.  Moreover, our Site Academic Leadership Team (SALT) provides\rsupport and additional professional development to staff.  Our ability to continuously improve our practices with additional materials and professional\rdevelopment is generously supported through Supplemental Concentration funding.  ... Unnamed: 6

Three professional development days are organized by the LLCSD\rEducational Services office.  This year, teachers were trained in Depth of Knowledge (DOK)and applying the rigor for each DOK level in their classrooms.\rIn addition, our science teachers continue to work with UCLA to refine lessons and provide real-world experiences for children.  Our math teachers work\rwith our district experts to refine learning experiences for children.  This assists our ongoing efforts to refine our instruction.  Moreover, our teachers\rregularly collaborate 2 days per week to design lessons and activities that are in alignment with Common Core state standards.  These lessons increase\rthe level of inquiry, collaboration, citing of textual evidence, primary source referencing, writing,  practical applications of content and critical reading.\rThese goals are further supported by our 1:1 ratio of Chromebooks in every classroom for every student.  Technology is integrated into all aspects of\rclassroom lessons to add depth to each activity.\r\rPrior to Common Core, Lake Center staff participated in a great deal of training in Effective Instruction.  Teachers were trained in the areas of “teaching\rto an objective,” “active participation,” and checking for understanding.” These three elements of effective instruction have become standard practice\rhere at Lake Center and have been naturally embedded into Common Core lessons.\r\rAs we move forward in 2019-2020, we continue to support our teachers through professional development.  Lake Center teachers regularly attend\rAdvancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) workshops where they further enhance their instructional delivery practices.  One of these practices\ris using Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, and Reading (WICOR) across all subject matters.  During this school year, we are focusing on the\rWICOR strategies with particular emphasis on focused note taking, using notes as an instructional tool, and responding in writing about those notes or\rclass essential questions.  Our professional development activities and their implementation, are monitored through Data Reflection Sessions 5 times\rper year.  To help our teachers grow professionally as a team, Lake Center plans multiple site directed professional development sessions that cover such\rtopics as PBIS, Special Education, LCAP,  and the concept of rigor/depth of knowledge.  Moreover, our Site Academic Leadership Team (SALT) provides\rsupport and additional professional development to staff.  Our ability to continuously improve our practices with additional materials and professional\rdevelopment is generously supported through Supplemental Concentration funding.  ... Unnamed: 11
