We honor individual differences and\rlearningstylesaswellaspromoteasafe,orderly,caringandsupportiveenvironment.We\r------\raccomplish this by maintaining our coveted holistic approach with dedication from staff, parents\r--\rand our community. We make a difference challenging each child to reach his or her full potential,\rSan Mateo-Foster City School\racademically and socially.\rDistrict\r\r1170 Chess Drive\rAcademics\rFoster City, CA  94404\rOur students in grades TK to fifth come to us from neighborhoods near and far extending across\r(650) 312-7700\rthe city of San Mateo. They come with strengths and with challenges. We believe that all students\rwww.smfcsd.net\rare capable of learning to high standards because intelligence defined as problem solving and/or\rDistrict Governing Board\rproduct producing capability is the result of real physiological change in the brain that occurs as a\rNoelia Corzo - Presidentresult of sensory input, processing, organizing and pruning. It is therefore our challenge to design\r\rthe experiences that foster the development of intelligence in each student. We organize the\rKenneth Chin - Vice Presidentstandards-basedcurriculumintorichunitsofinstruction,whichconnectlearningbetween\r\rdisciplines and link to significant ideas. We endeavor further to help each child understand that\rRebecca Hitchcock - Clerks/he has a role in making our community into a place that we all want to live, a respectful\rcommunity, where we support each other to be the best that we can be. We recognize that the\rShara Watkins - Trusteechallengeofhelpingallstudentsreachproficiencyisunprecedentedandwemustlearna\rtremendous amount if we are going to succeed at this. We, parents and staff, come to this challenge\rAlison Proctor - Trusteeas dedicated learners. We understand that together, we are the single most significant controllable\rfactor in student achievement. We are proud of the work that we are doing to improve our\r\rstudents’ achievement on the California Standards Tests. We continuously work on improving our\rDistrict Administration\rtest scores and reducing the gap in achievement between our highest and lowest performing\rJoan Rosas, Ed.D.\rgroups and between our socioeconomically disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students. We\rSuperintendent\rwill continue to identify areas of needed growth and develop strategies to address those needs.\r\rSocial Emotional Development\rThe Life Skills program at Highlands Elementary School is the foundation of our school culture. We\remphasize and model the characteristics that we want our children to develop and demonstrate.\rThey are: caring, cooperation, common sense, courage, curiosity, effort, flexibility, friendship,\rinitiative, integrity, organization, patience, perseverance, pride, problem solving, resourcefulness,\rresponsibility and sense of humor. Our parents embrace these Life Skills and model them in their\rgenerous contributions of time and talent.

We make a difference challenging each child to reach his or her full potential,\rSan Mateo-Foster City School\racademically and socially.\rDistrict\r\r1170 Chess Drive\rAcademics\rFoster City, CA  94404\rOur students in grades TK to fifth come to us from neighborhoods near and far extending across\r(650) 312-7700\rthe city of San Mateo. They come with strengths and with challenges. We believe that all students\rwww.smfcsd.net\rare capable of learning to high standards because intelligence defined as problem solving and/or\rDistrict Governing Board\rproduct producing capability is the result of real physiological change in the brain that occurs as a\rNoelia Corzo - Presidentresult of sensory input, processing, organizing and pruning. It is therefore our challenge to design\r\rthe experiences that foster the development of intelligence in each student. We organize the\rKenneth Chin - Vice Presidentstandards-basedcurriculumintorichunitsofinstruction,whichconnectlearningbetween\r\rdisciplines and link to significant ideas. We endeavor further to help each child understand that\rRebecca Hitchcock - Clerks/he has a role in making our community into a place that we all want to live, a respectful\rcommunity, where we support each other to be the best that we can be. We recognize that the\rShara Watkins - Trusteechallengeofhelpingallstudentsreachproficiencyisunprecedentedandwemustlearna\rtremendous amount if we are going to succeed at this. We, parents and staff, come to this challenge\rAlison Proctor - Trusteeas dedicated learners. We understand that together, we are the single most significant controllable\rfactor in student achievement. We are proud of the work that we are doing to improve our\r\rstudents’ achievement on the California Standards Tests. We continuously work on improving our\rDistrict Administration\rtest scores and reducing the gap in achievement between our highest and lowest performing\rJoan Rosas, Ed.D.\rgroups and between our socioeconomically disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students. We\rSuperintendent\rwill continue to identify areas of needed growth and develop strategies to address those needs.\r\rSocial Emotional Development\rThe Life Skills program at Highlands Elementary School is the foundation of our school culture. We\remphasize and model the characteristics that we want our children to develop and demonstrate.\rThey are: caring, cooperation, common sense, courage, curiosity, effort, flexibility, friendship,\rinitiative, integrity, organization, patience, perseverance, pride, problem solving, resourcefulness,\rresponsibility and sense of humor.

We make a difference challenging each child to reach his or her full potential,\rSan Mateo-Foster City School\racademically and socially.\rDistrict\r\r1170 Chess Drive\rAcademics\rFoster City, CA  94404\rOur students in grades TK to fifth come to us from neighborhoods near and far extending across\r(650) 312-7700\rthe city of San Mateo. They come with strengths and with challenges. We believe that all students\rwww.smfcsd.net\rare capable of learning to high standards because intelligence defined as problem solving and/or\rDistrict Governing Board\rproduct producing capability is the result of real physiological change in the brain that occurs as a\rNoelia Corzo - Presidentresult of sensory input, processing, organizing and pruning. It is therefore our challenge to design\r\rthe experiences that foster the development of intelligence in each student. We organize the\rKenneth Chin - Vice Presidentstandards-basedcurriculumintorichunitsofinstruction,whichconnectlearningbetween\r\rdisciplines and link to significant ideas. We endeavor further to help each child understand that\rRebecca Hitchcock - Clerks/he has a role in making our community into a place that we all want to live, a respectful\rcommunity, where we support each other to be the best that we can be. We recognize that the\rShara Watkins - Trusteechallengeofhelpingallstudentsreachproficiencyisunprecedentedandwemustlearna\rtremendous amount if we are going to succeed at this. We, parents and staff, come to this challenge\rAlison Proctor - Trusteeas dedicated learners. We understand that together, we are the single most significant controllable\rfactor in student achievement. We are proud of the work that we are doing to improve our\r\rstudents’ achievement on the California Standards Tests. We continuously work on improving our\rDistrict Administration\rtest scores and reducing the gap in achievement between our highest and lowest performing\rJoan Rosas, Ed.D.\rgroups and between our socioeconomically disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students. We\rSuperintendent\rwill continue to identify areas of needed growth and develop strategies to address those needs.\r\rSocial Emotional Development\rThe Life Skills program at Highlands Elementary School is the foundation of our school culture. We\remphasize and model the characteristics that we want our children to develop and demonstrate.\rThey are: caring, cooperation, common sense, courage, curiosity, effort, flexibility, friendship,\rinitiative, integrity, organization, patience, perseverance, pride, problem solving, resourcefulness,\rresponsibility and sense of humor.
