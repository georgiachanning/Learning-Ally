Each week, teachers meet in grade-\rlevel groups or as a whole staff to review student work, plan instruction, and review teaching strategies. Staff may also attend training sessions that\raddress their specific interests and needs.  During the summer of 2017 two teachers were trained in Kevin Clark (EL training).\rWe are in our second year of training in the Kevin Clark EL strategies for the 18-19 year.   The training was based on current need as measured by the\rSBAC and local assessments.  Teachers are supported through in-class coaching and training, teacher-principal meetings, as well as coach/mentor\rmeetings.  Roosevelt is an AVID Elementary School.  Teachers have attended training in San Diego.  Currently, five teachers have gone to training.  These\rteachers are providing professional development to the staff.\r\rRecent and ongoing district-wide staff development is largely dedicated to EDI (Explicit Direct Instruction).  The majority of professional development\rduring the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school year was devoted to English Language Literacy.  In the 2017-2018 School year the emphasis has been on\rLanguage Arts and ELD, for the 2018-2019 school year the focus is on English Language Development with the training of staff in the methods promoted\rby Kevin Clark Consulting. The focus remains on Kevin Clark Strategies in the 2019-2020 school year.\rFor the 2015-16 school year in October, 1 full day was dedicated to professional development in the area of English Language Curriculum Development\rTraining.\rFor the 2016-17 School year in October, 1 full day was dedicated to Special Education requirements, Illuminate training, and Kevin Clark training.\rFor the 2018-19 School year in October, 1 full day was dedicated to ELD development with Kevin Clark Consulting.\rFor the 2019-2020 school year in October, 1 full day of professional development was devoted to a staff overview of the ELL Roadmap and Kevin Clark\rstrategies.  ...

Each week, teachers meet in grade-\rlevel groups or as a whole staff to review student work, plan instruction, and review teaching strategies. Staff may also attend training sessions that\raddress their specific interests and needs.  During the summer of 2017 two teachers were trained in Kevin Clark (EL training).\rWe are in our second year of training in the Kevin Clark EL strategies for the 18-19 year.   The training was based on current need as measured by the\rSBAC and local assessments.  Teachers are supported through in-class coaching and training, teacher-principal meetings, as well as coach/mentor\rmeetings.  Roosevelt is an AVID Elementary School.  Teachers have attended training in San Diego.  Currently, five teachers have gone to training.  These\rteachers are providing professional development to the staff.\r\rRecent and ongoing district-wide staff development is largely dedicated to EDI (Explicit Direct Instruction).
