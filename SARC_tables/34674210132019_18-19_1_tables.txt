Paseo Grande High School\r2018-2019 School Accountability Report Card\rPublished in the 2019-2020 School Year\rSARC Information\rEvery school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC)\rby February 1st of each year. The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each\rCalifornia public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all Local Educational Agencies\r(LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend\rto meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities.\rAdditionally, data reported in a LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.\r• For more information about SARC requirements, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC\rwebpage at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/.\r• For more information about the LCFF or LCAP, see the CDE LCFF Webpage at http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/\raa/lc/.\r• For additional information about the school, parents and community members should contact the school\rprincipal or the district office.\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest Web page at http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/\rthat contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district, the county,\rand the state. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test\rdata, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English\rlearners).\rSchool Mission Statement\rThe school’s mission is to provide students seeking an alternative school setting with a personalized approach\rto learning that empowers them to take responsibility for their education and to graduate with the skills they\rneed to become responsible citizens and lifelong learners.\rIn order to carry out this mission, the school strives to equip the surrounding area students with the educational\rskills necessary in the 21st century – the ability to read, write, speak, and calculate with clarity and precision\rand the ability to participate intelligently and responsibly in a global society. The school offers alternative\rchoices through site-based learning, independent study, and distance learning to enable students to acquire\rthe knowledge necessary to make a difference in their lives.\rThe school provides a diverse, student-centered environment in which all students are held to high academic\rand behavioral standards. Students work in collaborative relationships, both within and outside the school,\rand perform service to the community. Through a personalized learning approach to education, the school\rstrives to develop students who are competent, self-motivated, life-long learners. In order to accomplish this,\rthe school emphasizes increased parental involvement, more one-on-one teacher and student interaction,\rattention to differences in learning styles, student-driven participation in developing the learning process,\rtechnology access, varied learning environments, teacher and parent development programs, and choices in\rcurriculum programs.\rThe school places a strong emphasis on parental involvement within the learning process. Parents are viewed\ras an essential link in improving education; therefore, parents are encouraged to take part in their children’s\reducation through frequent communication with the teachers, participation in school related functions, and\rattendance in school sponsored parent development workshops. By providing a vehicle for meaningful\rparental involvement, the school strives to bridge the gap between school and home. It is the hope of the\rschool that students will observe first-hand their parents and teachers working together to make a difference\rin their education and future.\rSchool Profile (School Year 2019-20)\rPaseo Grande High School opened in the fall of 2015.  It is a public charter school that offers a personalized\reducational program for high school students and families who prefer completing a virtual Independent Study\rmodel to meet academic needs. Typical students are those who have become dissatisfied with the quality\rof education they are receiving in the local public-school systems. Students come to the school because\rthey were unsuccessful in the traditional high school setting or they needed a more personalized approach\rto education. Other students need the flexibility of an independent study model to meet family obligations\rsuch as work or childcare needs. Regardless of the reason, the school offers a uniquely structured academic\rprogram, rigorously guided by the California Subject Area Content Standards that provides a challenging, yet\rhighly individualized, education for students.

Student\rRetention Meetings include the School Counselor, School Administrator, and the Student Retention Specialist. When the student and parent meet\rwith the S.R.S team, serious conversations take place about the appropriateness of independent study for the student, school options, and the\rserious long-term consequences of dropping out of school.\rThe chart displays the graduation and dropout rates for the school. At the time of publication, data for the 2018-19 school year was not available.\rNote: As an independent charter school, the school’s program, resources, and administration are run independently from the host district, so there is\rno district data to report for comparison in this section.\rNote: The National Center for Education Statistics graduation rate is provided in the table.\rGraduation & Dropout Rates\rDropoutGraduation\r15-1616-1717-1815-1616-1717-18\rSchool25.0%30.6%25.0%18.8%24.5%42.9%\rState9.7%9.1%9.6%83.8%82.7%83.0%\rState Priority: School Climate\rThe SARC provides the following information relevant to the School Climate State Priority (Priority 6):\r• Pupil suspension rates\r• Pupil expulsion rates\r• Other local measures on the sense of safety\rSuspensions & Expulsions\rThe table displays the suspensions and expulsions for the school.

We review our School Safety Plans\rannually and update them if necessary.\rThe safety of students and staff is a primary concern for the school.  Both teachers and administrators supervise the students throughout the school\rday to ensure a safe and positive learning environment. Both staff and student school IDs are expected to be displayed at all times, and visitor to\rthe sites must register in at the front office to receive appropriate identification badges. The school safety plan was last updated and reviewed with\rschool staff in December 2019.\rOther SARC Information\rThe information in this section is required to be in the SARC but is not included in the state priorities for LCFF.\rNote: As an independent charter school, the school’s program, resources, and administration are run independently from the host district, so there is\rno district data to report for comparison in this section.\rClass Size\rDue to the nature of independent study, class size distribution data is unavailable for this school.\rAdvanced Placement Classes (School Year 2018-19)\rPaseo Grande High School does not offer Advanced Placement Classes.\rAdditional Internet Access & Public Libraries\rFor additional research materials and Internet availability, students are encouraged to visit the libraries in their local communities, which contain\rnumerous computer workstations.

We review our School Safety Plans\rannually and update them if necessary.\rThe safety of students and staff is a primary concern for the school.  Both teachers and administrators supervise the students throughout the school\rday to ensure a safe and positive learning environment. Both staff and student school IDs are expected to be displayed at all times, and visitor to\rthe sites must register in at the front office to receive appropriate identification badges. The school safety plan was last updated and reviewed with\rschool staff in December 2019.\rOther SARC Information\rThe information in this section is required to be in the SARC but is not included in the state priorities for LCFF.\rNote: As an independent charter school, the school’s program, resources, and administration are run independently from the host district, so there is\rno district data to report for comparison in this section.\rClass Size\rDue to the nature of independent study, class size distribution data is unavailable for this school.\rAdvanced Placement Classes (School Year 2018-19)\rPaseo Grande High School does not offer Advanced Placement Classes.\rAdditional Internet Access & Public Libraries\rFor additional research materials and Internet availability, students are encouraged to visit the libraries in their local communities, which contain\rnumerous computer workstations.

We review our School Safety Plans\rannually and update them if necessary.\rThe safety of students and staff is a primary concern for the school.  Both teachers and administrators supervise the students throughout the school\rday to ensure a safe and positive learning environment. Both staff and student school IDs are expected to be displayed at all times, and visitor to\rthe sites must register in at the front office to receive appropriate identification badges.
