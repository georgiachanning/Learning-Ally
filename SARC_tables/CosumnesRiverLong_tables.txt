Where Roadrunners Race to Excellence!\rStudents have been educated in the Sloughhouse community for over 165 years when groups of miners, farmers and\rbusiness owners believed their children deserved a quality education. They built schools along the Cosumnes River\rthroughout the years believing it was their responsibility to provide formalized schooling for their children. Although one of\rour oldest schools (Rhoads School) now resides at Elk Grove Regional Park, our new nine-year-old campus has all the\ramenities and technological capabilities of a modern institution of learning.\rThe history of respect and support for education continues at CRES today. Our single most important goal is to ensure that\rour students enjoy academic success throughout their educational experience.\rWe provide a safe, positive learning environment while challenging all students to realize their greatest potential. We are a\rPBIS school that expects and rewards our students each day they are respectful, responsible, and ready to learn.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths, including:\r• A staff that is experienced, skilled, and committed to meeting the learning needs of all students,\r• A student body that is motivated to succeed each and every day,\r• Parents that are committed to supporting the education of their children, and\r• A community that partners with us to help us achieve all of our goals.\rParent support and involvement are important aspects of the success at CRES. Some parents help plan the programs and\rpolicies, while others serve as classroom volunteers or field trip chaperones. Parents also support student success by\rproviding space, time, and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear message that education and regular\rschool attendance are important to the family.\rOur roadrunners race to excellence each and every day here at Cosumnes River Elementary School.\rSheila Caruthers, Principal\rCosumnes River Elementary School                    Unnamed: 0

Where Roadrunners Race to Excellence!\rStudents have been educated in the Sloughhouse community for over 165 years when groups of miners, farmers and\rbusiness owners believed their children deserved a quality education. They built schools along the Cosumnes River\rthroughout the years believing it was their responsibility to provide formalized schooling for their children. Although one of\rour oldest schools (Rhoads School) now resides at Elk Grove Regional Park, our new nine-year-old campus has all the\ramenities and technological capabilities of a modern institution of learning.\rThe history of respect and support for education continues at CRES today. Our single most important goal is to ensure that\rour students enjoy academic success throughout their educational experience.\rWe provide a safe, positive learning environment while challenging all students to realize their greatest potential. We are a\rPBIS school that expects and rewards our students each day they are respectful, responsible, and ready to learn.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths, including:\r• A staff that is experienced, skilled, and committed to meeting the learning needs of all students,\r• A student body that is motivated to succeed each and every day,\r• Parents that are committed to supporting the education of their children, and\r• A community that partners with us to help us achieve all of our goals.\rParent support and involvement are important aspects of the success at CRES. Some parents help plan the programs and\rpolicies, while others serve as classroom volunteers or field trip chaperones. Parents also support student success by\rproviding space, time, and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear message that education and regular\rschool attendance are important to the family.\rOur roadrunners race to excellence each and every day here at Cosumnes River Elementary School.\rSheila Caruthers, Principal\rCosumnes River Elementary School                                         Unnamed: 0

Where Roadrunners Race to Excellence!\rStudents have been educated in the Sloughhouse community for over 165 years when groups of miners, farmers and\rbusiness owners believed their children deserved a quality education. They built schools along the Cosumnes River\rthroughout the years believing it was their responsibility to provide formalized schooling for their children. Although one of\rour oldest schools (Rhoads School) now resides at Elk Grove Regional Park, our new nine-year-old campus has all the\ramenities and technological capabilities of a modern institution of learning.\rThe history of respect and support for education continues at CRES today. Our single most important goal is to ensure that\rour students enjoy academic success throughout their educational experience.\rWe provide a safe, positive learning environment while challenging all students to realize their greatest potential. We are a\rPBIS school that expects and rewards our students each day they are respectful, responsible, and ready to learn.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths, including:\r• A staff that is experienced, skilled, and committed to meeting the learning needs of all students,\r• A student body that is motivated to succeed each and every day,\r• Parents that are committed to supporting the education of their children, and\r• A community that partners with us to help us achieve all of our goals.\rParent support and involvement are important aspects of the success at CRES.

Where Roadrunners Race to Excellence!\rStudents have been educated in the Sloughhouse community for over 165 years when groups of miners, farmers and\rbusiness owners believed their children deserved a quality education. They built schools along the Cosumnes River\rthroughout the years believing it was their responsibility to provide formalized schooling for their children. Although one of\rour oldest schools (Rhoads School) now resides at Elk Grove Regional Park, our new nine-year-old campus has all the\ramenities and technological capabilities of a modern institution of learning.\rThe history of respect and support for education continues at CRES today. Our single most important goal is to ensure that\rour students enjoy academic success throughout their educational experience.\rWe provide a safe, positive learning environment while challenging all students to realize their greatest potential. We are a\rPBIS school that expects and rewards our students each day they are respectful, responsible, and ready to learn.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths, including:\r• A staff that is experienced, skilled, and committed to meeting the learning needs of all students,\r• A student body that is motivated to succeed each and every day,\r• Parents that are committed to supporting the education of their children, and\r• A community that partners with us to help us achieve all of our goals.\rParent support and involvement are important aspects of the success at CRES. Some parents help plan the programs and\rpolicies, while others serve as classroom volunteers or field trip chaperones.

Emergency repair needs are quickly resolved by our custodian or\rdistrict maintenance staff. Our custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a daily cleaning process and\rschedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering school grounds. Restrooms are\rinspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary. The EGUSD Board of Education\rhas adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school office\ror at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rMeasure M funds will allow us to add an additional shade structure to our blacktop area to provide additional bench seating\rand shade for all of our students. The CRES PTA is providing new picnic benches for the additional shade structure when it is\rinstalled. A new solid shed will also be installed near our CRES garden to house tools and equipment for our afterschool\rgarden program. A CRES PTA funded "hydration station" will be located in our cafeteria for student and staff use.  ... Unnamed: 2

[3 rows x 4 columns],   Overall Facility (School Year 2019 - 2020)\rYear and month of the most recent FIT report: 2/26/2019\rOverall Rating\rExemplaryGoodFairPoor\rx\rThe district’s maintenance and grounds departments work in concert with our custodial team to ensure that school buildings,\rclassrooms, and grounds are maintained at exceptional levels to provide a safe and functional environment for all students.\rThe district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to communicate\rmaintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are quickly resolved by our custodian or\rdistrict maintenance staff. Our custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a daily cleaning process and\rschedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering school grounds. Restrooms are\rinspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary. The EGUSD Board of Education\rhas adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school office\ror at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rMeasure M funds will allow us to add an additional shade structure to our blacktop area to provide additional bench seating\rand shade for all of our students. The CRES PTA is providing new picnic benches for the additional shade structure when it is\rinstalled.

[2 rows x 4 columns],   Overall Facility (School Year 2019 - 2020)\rYear and month of the most recent FIT report: 2/26/2019\rOverall Rating\rExemplaryGoodFairPoor\rx\rThe district’s maintenance and grounds departments work in concert with our custodial team to ensure that school buildings,\rclassrooms, and grounds are maintained at exceptional levels to provide a safe and functional environment for all students.\rThe district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to communicate\rmaintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are quickly resolved by our custodian or\rdistrict maintenance staff. Our custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a daily cleaning process and\rschedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering school grounds. Restrooms are\rinspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary. The EGUSD Board of Education\rhas adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school office\ror at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rMeasure M funds will allow us to add an additional shade structure to our blacktop area to provide additional bench seating\rand shade for all of our students. The CRES PTA is providing new picnic benches for the additional shade structure when it is\rinstalled. A new solid shed will also be installed near our CRES garden to house tools and equipment for our afterschool\rgarden program. A CRES PTA funded "hydration station" will be located in our cafeteria for student and staff use.

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5
