The School Site Council (SSC) meets approximately once a month to develop, implement,\rmonitor, and evaluate the school plan for student achievement. School plans align with the district's Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). Parent\rrepresentatives are elected to the School Site Council and serve two year terms. All parents are welcome and encouraged to attend these meetings, as\rwell as the District Advisory Committee (DAC) meetings, as a way to learn more about our school funding and academic goals.\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.
