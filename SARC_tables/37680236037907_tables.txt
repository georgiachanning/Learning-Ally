In 2017-18\rLauderbach focused on ensuring students were accessing text on a daily basis, being provided multiple reading opportunities throughout the day and\rensuring students were demonstrating learning through collaborative groups and independently.  In 2017-18, Lauderbach focused on building our critical\rwriters so that our students are articulate and are able to communicate proficiently and attend to audience, task, and purpose in their writing.  In 2018-\r19, Lauderbach's content focus is Math. All staff will participate in best practices that support the high impact instructional strategies in Math. In addition,\rLauderbach is continuing to focus on building our critical writers so that our students are articulate and are able to communicate proficiently and attend\rto audience, task, and purpose in their writing by focusing on Mentor Text.  Teachers will also receive PD from the district and school on Designated ELD.\rLauderbach staff members will continue to grow professionally in the area of Mathematical Practices and Mathematical Discourse, Guided and\rIndependent Reading by continuing to participate in the Professional Learning Cycle in Math, and opportunities to participate in peer observations. All\rstaff are committed in working collaboratively to analyze student data to better teach to the needs of the individual student.
