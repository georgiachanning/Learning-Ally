For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.  Additionally, Dove Hill utilizes materials from Literature Connections and SNAP designed to enhance and improve  the\rteaching of reading and writing with the support of individual and grade level coaching.  As a staff, we are committed to the successful implementation\rof PBIS and continue to receive professional development for the continued successful implementation.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,538$307$6,231$107,128\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-44.712.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-13.427.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.  Additionally, Dove Hill utilizes materials from Literature Connections and SNAP designed to enhance and improve  the\rteaching of reading and writing with the support of individual and grade level coaching.

For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.  Additionally, Dove Hill utilizes materials from Literature Connections and SNAP designed to enhance and improve  the\rteaching of reading and writing with the support of individual and grade level coaching.

For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.

For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.

For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.  Additionally, Dove Hill utilizes materials from Literature Connections and SNAP designed to enhance and improve  the\rteaching of reading and writing with the support of individual and grade level coaching.

For the past three years, the\rdistrict has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional growth opportunities in\rcurriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.  Monthly, teachers participate in professional staff development that supports implementation of\rCommon Core State Standards at site staff development days.  At Dove Hill, our curricular program has added Sobrato Early Academic Language (SEAL)\rto it's instructional repertoire for students in grades TK-3.  This dovetails nicely with the continued professional development and coaching to enhance\rour reading and writing program.  Additionally, Dove Hill utilizes materials from Literature Connections and SNAP designed to enhance and improve  the\rteaching of reading and writing with the support of individual and grade level coaching.
