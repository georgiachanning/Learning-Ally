Our\rinstructional model is based on current brain research focusing on how children’s brains learn best.  Our Staff Development days are focused on enhancing\rour instructional delivery for students at all ability levels, including strategies that best meet the needs of our English Language Learners and at-risk\rstudents.\r\rCedarcreek staff members have been trained in Systematic English Language Development; new teachers will be trained by the end of the school year.\rIn order to meet the needs of English learners during core curriculum a select group of teachers were trained in Constructing Meaning, which helps\rsupport integrated language development.  Training is continuing with additional teachers participating in training each school year.  This training assists\rour staff members at better meeting the linguistic and academic needs of all of our students.\r\rTechnology in the classrooms has also been a focus this school year.  All classrooms, kindergarten through sixth grade, have access to Chromebooks or\rlaptops in order for them to learn typing skills, use Google classroom, complete research, and engage in individual lessons on the I-Ready program.\rStudents enrich their mathematical skills in problem solving using on-line NextGen Math.  Every classroom also has the newest flat panel technology in\rorder to deliver the most interactive, engaging lessons possible. Professional growth training is provided in the use of these technologies throughout the\rschool year.\r\rIn addition, the district provides Teachers on Special Assignment, TOSA, who support our teachers.  Our TOSA Staff includes a Physical Education teacher,\rtechnology teachers, early Literacy teachers, math teachers, and a science teacher.   The TOSAs provide staff development, demonstration lessons, and\rindividual training for teachers throughout the district.  ... Unnamed: 11

Our\rinstructional model is based on current brain research focusing on how children’s brains learn best.  Our Staff Development days are focused on enhancing\rour instructional delivery for students at all ability levels, including strategies that best meet the needs of our English Language Learners and at-risk\rstudents.\r\rCedarcreek staff members have been trained in Systematic English Language Development; new teachers will be trained by the end of the school year.\rIn order to meet the needs of English learners during core curriculum a select group of teachers were trained in Constructing Meaning, which helps\rsupport integrated language development.  Training is continuing with additional teachers participating in training each school year.  This training assists\rour staff members at better meeting the linguistic and academic needs of all of our students.\r\rTechnology in the classrooms has also been a focus this school year.  All classrooms, kindergarten through sixth grade, have access to Chromebooks or\rlaptops in order for them to learn typing skills, use Google classroom, complete research, and engage in individual lessons on the I-Ready program.\rStudents enrich their mathematical skills in problem solving using on-line NextGen Math.  Every classroom also has the newest flat panel technology in\rorder to deliver the most interactive, engaging lessons possible. Professional growth training is provided in the use of these technologies throughout the\rschool year.\r\rIn addition, the district provides Teachers on Special Assignment, TOSA, who support our teachers.  Our TOSA Staff includes a Physical Education teacher,\rtechnology teachers, early Literacy teachers, math teachers, and a science teacher.   The TOSAs provide staff development, demonstration lessons, and\rindividual training for teachers throughout the district.  ... Unnamed: 6
