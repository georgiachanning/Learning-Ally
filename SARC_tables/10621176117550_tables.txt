A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan les-sons or units as an entire\rgrade level.\r\rAn effective process for staff development and curriculum improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrators. Topics relevant to\rthe needs and priorities of the school are identified early in the year, and monthly staff-development sessions are scheduled accordingly. It should also\rbe pointed out that CUSD offers a New Teacher Training Academy for beginning teachers. This is a two-year program targeted at five performance areas.\r\rTeachers also meet as a grade-level team each week to look at student needs and discuss ways they can support each other to meet those needs.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and culturally relevant understanding.\r\rIn the 2018-19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.\r\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district-sponsored training that\rincluded:  curriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional\rpractices.  ...

A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.\r\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.
