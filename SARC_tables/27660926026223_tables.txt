The\rpriorities were determined by analysis of student data, teacher input and professional research. District professional development is provided by\rteachers, administrators, and professional trainers. The trainings are provided in workshops, staff meetings, PLCs (Professional Learning Communities),\ronline and at conferences. Highland Elementary School has the flexibility to develop its own PD plan at the site level. Teachers have multiple opportunities\rto improve instruction and subject area knowledge. Teachers are supported by administrators at the district and site level, as well as by an Academic\rCoach. There are regular classroom visits to provide feedback and provide support.

The\rpriorities were determined by analysis of student data, teacher input and professional research. District professional development is provided by\rteachers, administrators, and professional trainers. The trainings are provided in workshops, staff meetings, PLCs (Professional Learning Communities),\ronline and at conferences. Highland Elementary School has the flexibility to develop its own PD plan at the site level. Teachers have multiple opportunities\rto improve instruction and subject area knowledge.
