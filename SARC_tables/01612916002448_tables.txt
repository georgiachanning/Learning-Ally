Our teachers meet every\rWednesday in  PLCs to discuss curriculum and student work.  The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meets once per month to assess the professional\rdevelopment needs of the school and plan future staff meeting agenda items. We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.

Our teachers meet every\rWednesday in  PLCs to discuss curriculum and student work.  The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meets once per month to assess the professional\rdevelopment needs of the school and plan future staff meeting agenda items. We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.  Teachers also participate in professional development after-school at the district and site level.\r\rTeachers are also released for full day collaboration with their grade level twice a year.

Our teachers meet every\rWednesday in  PLCs to discuss curriculum and student work.  The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meets once per month to assess the professional\rdevelopment needs of the school and plan future staff meeting agenda items. We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.

We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.  Teachers also participate in professional development after-school at the district and site level.\r\rTeachers are also released for full day collaboration with their grade level twice a year.

Our teachers meet every\rWednesday in  PLCs to discuss curriculum and student work.  The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meets once per month to assess the professional\rdevelopment needs of the school and plan future staff meeting agenda items. We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.  Teachers also participate in professional development after-school at the district and site level.\r\rTeachers are also released for full day collaboration with their grade level twice a year.

Our teachers meet every\rWednesday in  PLCs to discuss curriculum and student work.  The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) meets once per month to assess the professional\rdevelopment needs of the school and plan future staff meeting agenda items. We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.

We continue to include equity as an ongoing staff development focus area.\r\rStaff development is supported for classroom implementation through BTSA (Beginning Teachers Support and Assessment) Support Providers and District\rInstructional Coaches.  Teachers participate in District Professional Development days 2 times per year where they can choose training courses to meet\rtheir individual development needs.
