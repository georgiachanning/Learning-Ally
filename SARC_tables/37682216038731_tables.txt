The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district-wide professional development throughout the year. Areas of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for\rimplementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, curriculum training in language arts, English Language\rDevelopment, Mathematics, and Social Emotional Learning, as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners. Teachers of students\rwith special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. This\rprofessional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade-level teams, and through individual mentoring by the school\radministrator. The District also assists in the coordination of the BTSA Induction Support program for first and second year teachers. Teachers who are\rexperiencing difficultly or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.\r\rLast year the National School District hired two Social Workers.  The Social Workers provided professional development for Central School in the areas\rof Restorative Practices, and Social Emotional Learning.  In addition, the National School District also hired one full-time counselor for each school.  All\rcounselors have been provided professional development on the Sanford Harmony program, a curriculum focusing on the Social Emotional learning of\rstudents.  This year classroom teachers have been participating in professional development on the UCI (University of California Irvine) Math framework.\rThe UCI Math framework replaced the Rigorous Curriculum Design Math framework in the National School District.  The Mathematics professional\rdevelopment has been ongoing this school year. Teachers have had the opportunity to attend training during their non-school days as well as on the\rclock, and have been trained by consultants from the University of Irvine.  Last year the National School District  hired three District Resource Teachers\rwho have been providing additional professional development in Mathematics to teachers as well, in addition to other content areas. Most currently the\rNational School District Resource Teachers have been providing professional development in the area of English Language Arts and the English Language\rDevelopment standards and demonstrating to teachers how these standards work in tandem with one another. The National School District Resource\rTeachers are also available to provide coaching to classroom teachers and can offer modeled lessons in the classrooms.\r\rThe National School District has adopted the new English Language Arts program, Benchmark, as well as English Language Arts materials from the\rpublisher, American Reading Company.  Additional professional development on the new adoption will continue through the remainder of the school\ryear.  Our Language Arts Specialists at the school sites along with the Resource (RSP) Teachers, will be receiving training on the new English Language\rArts adoption in order to be able to provide additional professional development at their individual sites as well in order to assist staff with the\rimplementation of the new materials.  In addition to the professional development that teachers have been receiving this school year, site administrators\rhave also received professional development from the National School District Educational Services Department in the areas of the UCI Mathematics\rframework, Restorative Practices, Social Emotional Learning, and also professional development by American Reading Company.  In addition to\rcertificated staff and administrators, our classified staff has also been receiving professional development this school year.  Campus supervisors have\rreceived training in Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) as well as Restorative Practices.  In addition, our classified staff was trained by site\radministrators in the area of sexual harassment, school safety, and the school safety plans.  Finally, all employees have received training on Mandated\rReporting.  ... Unnamed: 6
