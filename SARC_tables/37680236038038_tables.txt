All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.  ...

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners. Imagine Learning, a computer-based language development program, provides structured practice to identified students at individual\rlevels.\r\rValley Vista has invested in a data and assessment management system (Illuminateed) and continues to update and purchase more computers and other\rtechnology tools for teaching such as laptops, document cameras, LCD projectors, and Smart TVs in order to provide our students and teachers with the\rtechnology know-how that is increasingly necessary in our society.

All Valley Vista students develop\rcompetence in the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, history-social science, physical education, and health education. Our Gifted And\rTalented Education (GATE) students are challenged academically through a differentiated classroom program and receive various extension learning\ropportunities provided by certificated classroom teachers and/or Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) teachers. In addition, GATE students may receive\rexperiences such as field trips and/or writing explorations led by our GATE certified teachers and/or at times volunteers.\r\rDistrict funds are used to provide for regular classroom teacher collaboration through the incorporation of VAPA teachers. Planning, data analysis, and\ron-going professional collaborative learning is the focus of site collaboration sessions.  All Valley Vista students participate in VAPA rotations that include\rArt, Theater, and Dance instruction. In addition, we have a Science teacher rotation for all our students. Our school's Response to Intervention begins\rwith a Student Study Team (SST) that monitors the progress of target students receiving interventions and modifications of the regular education\rprogram.  Classroom teachers provide invention sessions to students in need using materials and/or strategies designed to address particular, identified\rlearning gaps. Students use adaptive, web-based programs in order to extend their learning: 2nd through 6th graders use Achieve 3000, 1st-6th use\rAccelerated Reader, Kinder-2nd grade use Smarty Ants and/or RazKids. All students have access to ThinkCentral and Dreambox for math.\r\rWe include part-time English language assistant to provide timely state assessments and additional needs-based information to teachers of English\rlanguage learners.
