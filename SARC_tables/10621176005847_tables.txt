Areas of priority included the following:\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in math\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social science and science text for reading\rinstruction\r•Closing the achievement gap with our Focus Group Students\r•Developing the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program to reward positive behaviors\r\rTeachers: Professional-growth time for teachers is provided each week on early-release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\r\rTeachers are aware of school and district funds that provide for substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level\rarticulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student achievement.\r\rTeachers, upon their return from these conferences, share valuable information with their colleagues. The district also provides professional growth\ropportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars. New teachers to the profession or grade level receive further support\rthrough the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Sup-port and Assessment (BTSA) program and through their association with individual support\rproviders.\r\rCole places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\r\rParaprofessionals and other school personnel: Cole believes that paraprofessionals and other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on\rstudents and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made aware of the availability of school and district staff development and\rtraining funds. Personnel are invited to attend meet-ngs in which school resources are being allocated, participate in forums on current educational\rtopics, attend school commit-tees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.\r\rVolunteers: Cole utilizes many members of the community to enhance support to its students and strengthen the ties within the entire community.\rTraining for volunteers is provided at the district or site level. Volunteer members participate in many capacities, including the high school physical-\reducation tutorial program, crossing guards, parent classroom volunteers, SSC and SART.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\r\rTeachers are aware of school and district funds that provide for substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level\rarticulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student achievement.\r\rTeachers, upon their return from these conferences, share valuable information with their colleagues. The district also provides professional growth\ropportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars. New teachers to the profession or grade level receive further support\rthrough the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Sup-port and Assessment (BTSA) program and through their association with individual support\rproviders.\r\rCole places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\r\rParaprofessionals and other school personnel: Cole believes that paraprofessionals and other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on\rstudents and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made aware of the availability of school and district staff development and\rtraining funds. Personnel are invited to attend meet-ngs in which school resources are being allocated, participate in forums on current educational\rtopics, attend school commit-tees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.\r\rVolunteers: Cole utilizes many members of the community to enhance support to its students and strengthen the ties within the entire community.\rTraining for volunteers is provided at the district or site level. Volunteer members participate in many capacities, including the high school physical-\reducation tutorial program, crossing guards, parent classroom volunteers, SSC and SART.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.

Areas of priority included the following:\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in math\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social science and science text for reading\rinstruction\r•Closing the achievement gap with our Focus Group Students\r•Developing the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program to reward positive behaviors\r\rTeachers: Professional-growth time for teachers is provided each week on early-release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\r\rTeachers are aware of school and district funds that provide for substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level\rarticulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student achievement.\r\rTeachers, upon their return from these conferences, share valuable information with their colleagues. The district also provides professional growth\ropportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars. New teachers to the profession or grade level receive further support\rthrough the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Sup-port and Assessment (BTSA) program and through their association with individual support\rproviders.\r\rCole places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\r\rParaprofessionals and other school personnel: Cole believes that paraprofessionals and other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on\rstudents and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made aware of the availability of school and district staff development and\rtraining funds. Personnel are invited to attend meet-ngs in which school resources are being allocated, participate in forums on current educational\rtopics, attend school commit-tees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.\r\rVolunteers: Cole utilizes many members of the community to enhance support to its students and strengthen the ties within the entire community.\rTraining for volunteers is provided at the district or site level. Volunteer members participate in many capacities, including the high school physical-\reducation tutorial program, crossing guards, parent classroom volunteers, SSC and SART.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

Areas of priority included the following:\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in math\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social science and science text for reading\rinstruction\r•Closing the achievement gap with our Focus Group Students\r•Developing the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program to reward positive behaviors\r\rTeachers: Professional-growth time for teachers is provided each week on early-release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\r\rTeachers are aware of school and district funds that provide for substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level\rarticulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student achievement.\r\rTeachers, upon their return from these conferences, share valuable information with their colleagues. The district also provides professional growth\ropportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars. New teachers to the profession or grade level receive further support\rthrough the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Sup-port and Assessment (BTSA) program and through their association with individual support\rproviders.\r\rCole places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\r\rParaprofessionals and other school personnel: Cole believes that paraprofessionals and other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on\rstudents and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made aware of the availability of school and district staff development and\rtraining funds. Personnel are invited to attend meet-ngs in which school resources are being allocated, participate in forums on current educational\rtopics, attend school commit-tees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.\r\rVolunteers: Cole utilizes many members of the community to enhance support to its students and strengthen the ties within the entire community.\rTraining for volunteers is provided at the district or site level. Volunteer members participate in many capacities, including the high school physical-\reducation tutorial program, crossing guards, parent classroom volunteers, SSC and SART.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

Areas of priority included the following:\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in math\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social science and science text for reading\rinstruction\r•Closing the achievement gap with our Focus Group Students\r•Developing the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program to reward positive behaviors\r\rTeachers: Professional-growth time for teachers is provided each week on early-release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\r\rTeachers are aware of school and district funds that provide for substitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level\rarticulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student achievement.\r\rTeachers, upon their return from these conferences, share valuable information with their colleagues. The district also provides professional growth\ropportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars. New teachers to the profession or grade level receive further support\rthrough the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Sup-port and Assessment (BTSA) program and through their association with individual support\rproviders.\r\rCole places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\r\rParaprofessionals and other school personnel: Cole believes that paraprofessionals and other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on\rstudents and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made aware of the availability of school and district staff development and\rtraining funds. Personnel are invited to attend meet-ngs in which school resources are being allocated, participate in forums on current educational\rtopics, attend school commit-tees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.\r\rVolunteers: Cole utilizes many members of the community to enhance support to its students and strengthen the ties within the entire community.\rTraining for volunteers is provided at the district or site level. Volunteer members participate in many capacities, including the high school physical-\reducation tutorial program, crossing guards, parent classroom volunteers, SSC and SART.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff. Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.
