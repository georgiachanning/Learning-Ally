Grade level collaboration is also being utilized to analyze student performance. Staff training is delivered at staff meetings, district\rmeetings, conferences and workshops. Staff is supported by grade level meetings, walkthroughs, principal feedback, and assessments.\r\rPrincipal Cohort Group meetings and walkthroughs are another source of professional development for the staff.
