The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system, enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the District Office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rSummer of 2015 new portables were brought on campus and the track was redone. With the passing of Measure M,\rTsukamoto will benefit from the district's Facilities Master Plan over the next 10 years. Improvements will include\rmodernization of facilities, including technology updates and overall site improvements, as identified and prioritized by district\rpersonnel, site staff, and community input and planning. Our heating/air conditioning system and alarm system were updated\rthis past year.  ... Unnamed: 2

[3 rows x 4 columns],   Overall Facility (School Year 2019 - 2020)\rYear and month of the most recent FIT report: 5/14/2019\rOverall Rating\rExemplaryGoodFairPoor\rx\rThe district’s Maintenance and Grounds Departments work in concert with the school site custodial team to ensure that\rschool buildings, classrooms, and grounds are maintained at exceptional levels to provide a safe and functional environment\rfor all students. The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system, enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the District Office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rSummer of 2015 new portables were brought on campus and the track was redone. With the passing of Measure M,\rTsukamoto will benefit from the district's Facilities Master Plan over the next 10 years. Improvements will include\rmodernization of facilities, including technology updates and overall site improvements, as identified and prioritized by district\rpersonnel, site staff, and community input and planning. Our heating/air conditioning system and alarm system were updated\rthis past year.  ... Unnamed: 2

[2 rows x 4 columns],   Overall Facility (School Year 2019 - 2020)\rYear and month of the most recent FIT report: 5/14/2019\rOverall Rating\rExemplaryGoodFairPoor\rx\rThe district’s Maintenance and Grounds Departments work in concert with the school site custodial team to ensure that\rschool buildings, classrooms, and grounds are maintained at exceptional levels to provide a safe and functional environment\rfor all students. The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system, enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the District Office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rSummer of 2015 new portables were brought on campus and the track was redone. With the passing of Measure M,\rTsukamoto will benefit from the district's Facilities Master Plan over the next 10 years. Improvements will include\rmodernization of facilities, including technology updates and overall site improvements, as identified and prioritized by district\rpersonnel, site staff, and community input and planning. Our heating/air conditioning system and alarm system were updated\rthis past year.

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the\rtotal number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                 Unnamed: 5
