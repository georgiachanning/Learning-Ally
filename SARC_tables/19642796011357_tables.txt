Based on our areas for growth as seen in our student data, our primary areas of focus over the past three\ryears have been on Rigorous Writing, Integrated Arts, and Best First Instruction practices.  Teachers are supported through class observations and\rfeedback, Teachers on Special Assignment provide support for planning, and they participate in PLC data protocols.\r\rThe district annually holds professional development days in which teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional learning opportunities in\rcurriculum and instructional practice in support of a continuous cycle of improvement. Professional learning opportunities include grade level and/or\rcontent-specific programming on full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data continues to be the\rdetermining factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last three years have been\rin the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history-social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as\rwell as the use of student data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district staff, Teachers on Special\rAssignment, as well as consultants and coaches who specialize in content-area pedagogy. Professional learning is structured in job-embedded workshops\rand professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and coaching support, and\rstudent work/data analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes strategies and pedagogy to support all learners access rigorous, grade-level\rstandards. All professional learning includes a special emphasis on supporting the development of English learners’ development of academic language\rand literacy.\r\rBeginning in 2017 through 2020, all teachers participated in six days of systematic, district-wide professional learning with a focus on instructional\rstrategies in support of our three student success drivers: academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive rigor.
