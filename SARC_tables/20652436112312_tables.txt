The content of staff development clearly reflects established school\rgoals for curriculum, instruction, student assessment, and student achievement.\r\rThe school’s priority goals are met through the completion of a variety of staff development activities and the Cycle of Inquiry (COI) process. We plan\rstaff training to support the professional and personal growth of personnel who work with students at Lincoln. Each grade level also participates in Lesson\rDesign days working with the Teacher on Special Assignment to aid in implementation of the Common Core State Standards. These activities help staff\rmembers refine existing skills, learn new skills, and gain knowledge needed for effective implementation of the curriculum. The teachers, administrators,\rand support teachers (technology and intervention) are directly involved in planning and conducting the staff development. During teacher planning\rtime, teachers participate in grade level Professional Learning Communities (PLC), meeting at regular intervals to align curriculum, to review student\rdata, to create common formative assessments, and to share successful teaching strategies.\r\rWe evaluate these activities and use the results to further meet the needs of staff. We set aside funds for staff to attend seminars and trainings.\r\rTeachers participate in weekly staff development to learn new instructional strategies, seeking to keep current with new research-based teaching and\rlearning strategies. We implement Direct Instruction strategies in 2nd through 6th grade, and Write From The Beginning and Thinking Maps in\rKindergarten through 6th grades.\r\rThe district dedicated specific days to staff development. Topics for staff development during the 2018-19 school year include; Common Core, Lesson\rDesign implementing Common Core Standards, RtI Academic & Behavior Plan & Strategies, student engagement strategies and English Language\rDevelopment Strategies.  ...

The content of staff development clearly reflects established school\rgoals for curriculum, instruction, student assessment, and student achievement.\r\rThe school’s priority goals are met through the completion of a variety of staff development activities and the Cycle of Inquiry (COI) process. We plan\rstaff training to support the professional and personal growth of personnel who work with students at Lincoln. Each grade level also participates in Lesson\rDesign days working with the Teacher on Special Assignment to aid in implementation of the Common Core State Standards. These activities help staff\rmembers refine existing skills, learn new skills, and gain knowledge needed for effective implementation of the curriculum. The teachers, administrators,\rand support teachers (technology and intervention) are directly involved in planning and conducting the staff development. During teacher planning\rtime, teachers participate in grade level Professional Learning Communities (PLC), meeting at regular intervals to align curriculum, to review student\rdata, to create common formative assessments, and to share successful teaching strategies.\r\rWe evaluate these activities and use the results to further meet the needs of staff. We set aside funds for staff to attend seminars and trainings.\r\rTeachers participate in weekly staff development to learn new instructional strategies, seeking to keep current with new research-based teaching and\rlearning strategies. We implement Direct Instruction strategies in 2nd through 6th grade, and Write From The Beginning and Thinking Maps in\rKindergarten through 6th grades.\r\rThe district dedicated specific days to staff development. Topics for staff development during the 2018-19 school year include; Common Core, Lesson\rDesign implementing Common Core Standards, RtI Academic & Behavior Plan & Strategies, student engagement strategies and English Language\rDevelopment Strategies.  ...
