Keeping up to\rdate on the latest educational research and best practices helps us grow as educators and allows us to respond appropriately to our students’ needs.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, our staff participated in on-site in-services, workshops, grade-level meetings and staff meetings centered on the needs\rof our students based on assessment data. Topics of focus for the up-coming year will be Professional Learning Communities (PLC), Multi-Tiered System\rofSupport(MTSS),Social-EmotionalSupportforStudents,MathProblemSolving,BuildingInternalCoherenceandwritingcommonformative\rassessments. As part of our Internal Coherence work, our staff is learning about justifying answers through written responses across the curriculum. We\rhope to refine that shared learning by developing a clear progression of justification skills from transitional kindergarten to sixth grade. During the 2019-\r2020 school year, our team will be participating in staff development sessions dedicated to the new math curriculum pilot and a continuation of our\rMulti-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) implementation.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\r\rIn the 2019-20 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.\r\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

Keeping up to\rdate on the latest educational research and best practices helps us grow as educators and allows us to respond appropriately to our students’ needs.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, our staff participated in on-site in-services, workshops, grade-level meetings and staff meetings centered on the needs\rof our students based on assessment data. Topics of focus for the up-coming year will be Professional Learning Communities (PLC), Multi-Tiered System\rofSupport(MTSS),Social-EmotionalSupportforStudents,MathProblemSolving,BuildingInternalCoherenceandwritingcommonformative\rassessments. As part of our Internal Coherence work, our staff is learning about justifying answers through written responses across the curriculum. We\rhope to refine that shared learning by developing a clear progression of justification skills from transitional kindergarten to sixth grade. During the 2019-\r2020 school year, our team will be participating in staff development sessions dedicated to the new math curriculum pilot and a continuation of our\rMulti-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) implementation.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\r\rIn the 2019-20 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.\r\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.
