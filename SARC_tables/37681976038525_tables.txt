In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a common language around high quality teaching\rand learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional learning communities. This\rwork has included a deeper dive into content standards through the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective\rassessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on aligning instruction to\rstandards and student experience, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.\r\rNew for the 2019-20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while still\roffering face-to-face professional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi-year seminars where\rteachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards-based instruction, Mindful\rMath where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District math curriculum more\raccessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can use to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional\rdevelopment continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education, NGSS and effective\rintegration of technology into instruction.\r\rWith professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that it is relevant,\rtimely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to analyze student data and discuss best\rpractices to address the needs of each and every student.\r\rThe district offers workshops and multiple-day seminars, after-school workshops, online courses, and one-on-one coaching and modeling. Select teachers\ralso attend conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing professional development\rat site learning days and staff meetings.  ... Unnamed: 11

In recent years professional learning has emphasized developing a common language around high quality teaching\rand learning and building collaborative cultures that promote high levels of learning for all students through professional learning communities. This\rwork has included a deeper dive into content standards through the selection of essential standards and discussions around mastery and effective\rassessment. In response to student performance data and classroom observation, current professional learning focuses on aligning instruction to\rstandards and student experience, with extra time and resources dedicated to mathematics and English learners.\r\rNew for the 2019-20 school year is our Blended Professional Development program which will offer online professional development options while still\roffering face-to-face professional development. Some of the professional learning that we will offer includes: Igniting ELD multi-year seminars where\rteachers learn and implement strategies for designated and integrated ELD and using formative assessment to guide standards-based instruction, Mindful\rMath where participants will develop deeper understandings of math teaching and how to enrich it while making the District math curriculum more\raccessible to their students, and ProAct, which teaches participants techniques they can use to deescalate a child's behavior.  Additional professional\rdevelopment continues to address professional learning communities, curriculum adoptions, differentiation, special education, NGSS and effective\rintegration of technology into instruction.\r\rWith professional learning communities as a foundation, professional development is approached from multiple angles to ensure that it is relevant,\rtimely, and targeted to both student and teacher needs. Teachers meet weekly, as a grade level or discipline, to analyze student data and discuss best\rpractices to address the needs of each and every student.\r\rThe district offers workshops and multiple-day seminars, after-school workshops, online courses, and one-on-one coaching and modeling. Select teachers\ralso attend conferences and workshops offered through outside agencies.  District staff also partners with principals providing professional development\rat site learning days and staff meetings.  ... Unnamed: 6
