Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exemplary teachers in the District as\rwell as receive district training and attend professional workshops and seminars.\r\rOver the past three years, components of our professional development (PD) have evolved to meet the instructional needs of our students. This began\rwith the primary focus area for Polk's staff development is the continued development of our grade level Professional Learning Communities(PLCs). We\rrefined our primary focus to ensure that students continue to receive intentional literacy support based on their academic needs, combined with\rproviding instructional support in literacy for all grades TK-6 within the classroom. Over the past two years, our focus has included alongside our literacy\rdevelopment, an aligned focus for out integrated and designated ELD instruction and supports. Reflective looking at both the SBAC and ELPAC data\rcommunicated a need for continued building of capacity and refinement of instructional practices. This professional development focus helps continued\rthe process of building the systems and expertise in our staff to provide the best literacy/EL support on a daily basis through whole-class teaching and\rsmall group instruction while expanding that capacity into the content areas of science and social studies. Teachers continue to be supported in this\rprocess through the Professional Development delivered, PLC collaboration, model lessons (provided by on-site and district personnel), and reflective\rdialogue around current data.\r\r\rDuring the 2017-2018 school year, we continued to adapt our literacy support systems to meet our students' needs. We continued the opportunities for\rstaff to strengthen their capacity in the areas of reading and reading assessments. Professional Development was focused on the articulation and\rimplementation of Learning Goals and Success Criteria in conjunction with Effective Feedback. Utilizing writing as the starting point for this development\rallows an opportunity for each of those focus areas to have an impacting role in student performance. We have continued to focus on our EL students\rand strategies that benefit all students in their reading development. Becoming familiar with the new ELA adoption and enhancing our ability to break\rdown the text to ensure an understanding for all of our students has been threaded throughout our PD timeline for the school year.\r\rDuring the 2018-2019 school year, we continue our focus on literacy and EL. ELPD has focused on model lesson observation of a designated lesson in\rconjunction with an opportunity to hear the process for the design of the lesson observed. Debrief opportunities allowed for teachers to ask specific\rquestions about the lesson or the incorporation of strategies utilized into their own designated EL instruction. A valuable component of the ELPD was\rthe planning time that grade levels had at the conclusion of the debrief to build a designated lesson to utilize within their classroom. PD had also focused\ron integrated ELD instructional practices and strategies. Focused on how to connect EL supports throughout the instructional day and across grade levels.\rWe are also conducting the Lesson Study process as a site-based professional development for all grade levels (TK-6). This will allow all grade-level teams\rthe ability to collectively plan, teach (observe student learning), and debrief around a lesson that they identified as one' take-away' to will provide insight\rinto their instructional practice. PD in the spring will also include sessions on Social Emotional Learning to enhance our capacity to effectively support\rstudents who require additional support in this area.\r\rAs we progress through the 2019-2020 school year, we focus our professional development on supporting ELA and math using science and social studies\rcurriculum.

Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exemplary teachers in the District as\rwell as receive district training and attend professional workshops and seminars.\r\rOver the past three years, components of our professional development (PD) have evolved to meet the instructional needs of our students. This began\rwith the primary focus area for Polk's staff development is the continued development of our grade level Professional Learning Communities(PLCs). We\rrefined our primary focus to ensure that students continue to receive intentional literacy support based on their academic needs, combined with\rproviding instructional support in literacy for all grades TK-6 within the classroom. Over the past two years, our focus has included alongside our literacy\rdevelopment, an aligned focus for out integrated and designated ELD instruction and supports. Reflective looking at both the SBAC and ELPAC data\rcommunicated a need for continued building of capacity and refinement of instructional practices. This professional development focus helps continued\rthe process of building the systems and expertise in our staff to provide the best literacy/EL support on a daily basis through whole-class teaching and\rsmall group instruction while expanding that capacity into the content areas of science and social studies. Teachers continue to be supported in this\rprocess through the Professional Development delivered, PLC collaboration, model lessons (provided by on-site and district personnel), and reflective\rdialogue around current data.\r\r\rDuring the 2017-2018 school year, we continued to adapt our literacy support systems to meet our students' needs. We continued the opportunities for\rstaff to strengthen their capacity in the areas of reading and reading assessments. Professional Development was focused on the articulation and\rimplementation of Learning Goals and Success Criteria in conjunction with Effective Feedback. Utilizing writing as the starting point for this development\rallows an opportunity for each of those focus areas to have an impacting role in student performance. We have continued to focus on our EL students\rand strategies that benefit all students in their reading development. Becoming familiar with the new ELA adoption and enhancing our ability to break\rdown the text to ensure an understanding for all of our students has been threaded throughout our PD timeline for the school year.\r\rDuring the 2018-2019 school year, we continue our focus on literacy and EL. ELPD has focused on model lesson observation of a designated lesson in\rconjunction with an opportunity to hear the process for the design of the lesson observed. Debrief opportunities allowed for teachers to ask specific\rquestions about the lesson or the incorporation of strategies utilized into their own designated EL instruction. A valuable component of the ELPD was\rthe planning time that grade levels had at the conclusion of the debrief to build a designated lesson to utilize within their classroom. PD had also focused\ron integrated ELD instructional practices and strategies. Focused on how to connect EL supports throughout the instructional day and across grade levels.\rWe are also conducting the Lesson Study process as a site-based professional development for all grade levels (TK-6). This will allow all grade-level teams\rthe ability to collectively plan, teach (observe student learning), and debrief around a lesson that they identified as one' take-away' to will provide insight\rinto their instructional practice. PD in the spring will also include sessions on Social Emotional Learning to enhance our capacity to effectively support\rstudents who require additional support in this area.\r\rAs we progress through the 2019-2020 school year, we focus our professional development on supporting ELA and math using science and social studies\rcurriculum. In addition an emphasis on integrated EL best practices for science and social studies lesson design and instructional implementation.\rAdditional topics support the use of literacy programs such as Rhyme Magic and supporting math instruction through the use of identifying specific  ...
