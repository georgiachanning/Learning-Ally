This will be the 2nd year of this professional development which will empower our teachers to\rdeliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the California Common Core Standards. The project includes hands-on, research-based professional\rdevelopment, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath\radoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education researchers. A focus on\rprofessional development around the area of mathematics and English language arts was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAASPP\rdata. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers have and will continue to receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD\rframework. The ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language\rlearners and the need for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas\rof focus have been delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock\rofferings and during individual teacher planning days. Kimball Elementary, being a dual - language immersion school has also received staff development\ron GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) in order to assist students in becoming bi-literate. With our new English Language Arts adoption,\rBENCHMARK/ADELANTE all teachers continue to receive staff development in the implementation of all components of the materials. To support daily,\rrobust and rigorous reading, the National School District has adopted the American Reading Company 100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff\rdevelopment on best practices as we implement this reading program with our students. The American Reading Company will focus on providing students\rwith motivational reading materials at the students' independent reading abilities, set power goals and involve parents in ensuring that students are\rreading for at least :30 minutes per day. In addition to the staff development outlined, our district resource teachers will provide English language\rdevelopment academies to ensure that our English language learners will show positive growth in their language development skills. Our counselors have\rreceived training on the Sanford Harmony social-emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum\rin all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on\rhow to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. All of our teachers\rhave also received training on the de-escalation component of the Crisis Prevention Institute training.  ... Unnamed: 6

This will be the 2nd year of this professional development which will empower our teachers to\rdeliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the California Common Core Standards. The project includes hands-on, research-based professional\rdevelopment, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath\radoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education researchers. A focus on\rprofessional development around the area of mathematics and English language arts was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAASPP\rdata. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers have and will continue to receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD\rframework. The ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language\rlearners and the need for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas\rof focus have been delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock\rofferings and during individual teacher planning days. Kimball Elementary, being a dual - language immersion school has also received staff development\ron GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) in order to assist students in becoming bi-literate. With our new English Language Arts adoption,\rBENCHMARK/ADELANTE all teachers continue to receive staff development in the implementation of all components of the materials. To support daily,\rrobust and rigorous reading, the National School District has adopted the American Reading Company 100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff\rdevelopment on best practices as we implement this reading program with our students. The American Reading Company will focus on providing students\rwith motivational reading materials at the students' independent reading abilities, set power goals and involve parents in ensuring that students are\rreading for at least :30 minutes per day. In addition to the staff development outlined, our district resource teachers will provide English language\rdevelopment academies to ensure that our English language learners will show positive growth in their language development skills. Our counselors have\rreceived training on the Sanford Harmony social-emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum\rin all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on\rhow to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. All of our teachers\rhave also received training on the de-escalation component of the Crisis Prevention Institute training.  ... Unnamed: 11
