Professional\rdevelopment is provided at both the district and site.  The school facilitates and supports 45-minute Professional Learning Community (PLC)  collaborative\rmeetings twice a week in order for teachers in all grades to analyze, discuss, and utilize the results of common assessments, district benchmarks, and\rstate assessments to guide instruction, instructional planning, and student placement. Every other week teachers attend staff development on minimum\rdays after school based on the district and school site goals.\r\rDue to the shifts in ELA and Math CCSS and the results of the SBAC, McKinley has focused professional development for teachers from 17-18, 18-19, and\r19-20 school years to specific training in ELA instructional shifts, the teaching of reading through guided reading, literature circles, and close reading\rstrategies. In Math, the staff was introduced to the 8 Math Practices, teaching for conceptual knowledge, as well as best practices to teach procedural\rlessons. In addition, teachers were provided professional development for English learners and the ELD standards in integrated and designated settings.\rIn 18-19 and 19-20 the PD focus shifted to specifically train teachers on strategies of Academic Conversations using Academic language and accountable\rtalk.  Specifically the structure and intent of the academic conversations.  Teachers are also receiving on-going training and support at both the site and\rDistrict level in the implementation of Common Core State Standards and Authentic Performance Based Tasks, as well as utilizing technology within the\rclassroom.  A specific calendar outlining goals and objectives is provided to teachers each year.\r\rDuring the  2016-2017 school year, the McKinley staff received training over the summer on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to go with a school-\rwide process called The Leader in Me. The 7 Habits training was selected because there was an identified need to develop student efficacy and motivation.\rA grant from Franklin Foundation has enabled McKinley to able to teach the whole child social and emotional needs that had been lacking.  Students are\rlearning how to become a leader of their learning and to take ownership of their education which in turn builds their esteem and self-worth. In 2017-\r2018 McKinley staff aligned the 7 Habits to goal setting.  Students, classes, grade levels and teachers all set goals that aligned to the school-wide goals to\rincrease academic achievement. Students led the parent-teacher conference by presenting their goals and Leadership Notebooks.  During the 2018-2019\rMcKinley continues to weave the principles of the 7 Habits through the Empowering Instruction professional development that is based on the work of\rMarzano, Hattie, DuFour, Fisher, and Fry.  The end goal is to teach students the skills they need to be successful for college, career, and community for\rthe 21st Century. During 2019-2020 McKinley will incorporate the 7 Habits into the new Social Emotional Learning  curriculum adoption, by asking the\rquestion, "How does this concept relate to the 7 Habits?"\r\rThe staff received training during 2016-2017 on Visible Learning.  Administration and team of teachers received several days of training based on John\rHattie’s work of Visible Learning and developed an action plan that was implemented during the school year that emphasized Learning Outcomes and\rSuccess Criteria in ELA and Math.  In addition to the continued work of the aforementioned, McKinley will continue the Visible Learning work by including\reffective feedback for the 2017-2018 school year.  In the last three years, the percentage of proficiency for McKinley has significantly increased in ELA\rand math on the SBAC, there is still a need for students to develop skills in critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving. The 2018-2019 and\r2019-2020 academic focus is to develop skills related to academic discourse in all subject areas.  Teachers 3-6 are involved in a lesson study in math.  ... Unnamed: 6

Professional\rdevelopment is provided at both the district and site.  The school facilitates and supports 45-minute Professional Learning Community (PLC)  collaborative\rmeetings twice a week in order for teachers in all grades to analyze, discuss, and utilize the results of common assessments, district benchmarks, and\rstate assessments to guide instruction, instructional planning, and student placement. Every other week teachers attend staff development on minimum\rdays after school based on the district and school site goals.\r\rDue to the shifts in ELA and Math CCSS and the results of the SBAC, McKinley has focused professional development for teachers from 17-18, 18-19, and\r19-20 school years to specific training in ELA instructional shifts, the teaching of reading through guided reading, literature circles, and close reading\rstrategies. In Math, the staff was introduced to the 8 Math Practices, teaching for conceptual knowledge, as well as best practices to teach procedural\rlessons. In addition, teachers were provided professional development for English learners and the ELD standards in integrated and designated settings.\rIn 18-19 and 19-20 the PD focus shifted to specifically train teachers on strategies of Academic Conversations using Academic language and accountable\rtalk.  Specifically the structure and intent of the academic conversations.  Teachers are also receiving on-going training and support at both the site and\rDistrict level in the implementation of Common Core State Standards and Authentic Performance Based Tasks, as well as utilizing technology within the\rclassroom.  A specific calendar outlining goals and objectives is provided to teachers each year.\r\rDuring the  2016-2017 school year, the McKinley staff received training over the summer on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People to go with a school-\rwide process called The Leader in Me. The 7 Habits training was selected because there was an identified need to develop student efficacy and motivation.\rA grant from Franklin Foundation has enabled McKinley to able to teach the whole child social and emotional needs that had been lacking.  Students are\rlearning how to become a leader of their learning and to take ownership of their education which in turn builds their esteem and self-worth. In 2017-\r2018 McKinley staff aligned the 7 Habits to goal setting.  Students, classes, grade levels and teachers all set goals that aligned to the school-wide goals to\rincrease academic achievement. Students led the parent-teacher conference by presenting their goals and Leadership Notebooks.  During the 2018-2019\rMcKinley continues to weave the principles of the 7 Habits through the Empowering Instruction professional development that is based on the work of\rMarzano, Hattie, DuFour, Fisher, and Fry.  The end goal is to teach students the skills they need to be successful for college, career, and community for\rthe 21st Century. During 2019-2020 McKinley will incorporate the 7 Habits into the new Social Emotional Learning  curriculum adoption, by asking the\rquestion, "How does this concept relate to the 7 Habits?"\r\rThe staff received training during 2016-2017 on Visible Learning.  Administration and team of teachers received several days of training based on John\rHattie’s work of Visible Learning and developed an action plan that was implemented during the school year that emphasized Learning Outcomes and\rSuccess Criteria in ELA and Math.  In addition to the continued work of the aforementioned, McKinley will continue the Visible Learning work by including\reffective feedback for the 2017-2018 school year.  In the last three years, the percentage of proficiency for McKinley has significantly increased in ELA\rand math on the SBAC, there is still a need for students to develop skills in critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving. The 2018-2019 and\r2019-2020 academic focus is to develop skills related to academic discourse in all subject areas.  Teachers 3-6 are involved in a lesson study in math.  ... Unnamed: 11
