The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school.

With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction. Teachers are supported by discussing the\rprofessional learning at staff meetings and during PLC time.  Each year, we have offered at least 17 days of on-going professional learning time to our\rstaff.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12137.722751.629386.09$85,937\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District2.75.4\r\rSchool Site/ State22.34.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

The district provides\rprofessional learning on English Language Arts and English Language development, and supports the teachers in developing expertise in our newly\radopted ELA program. Staff members are encouraged to participate in their specific areas of interest. With the addition of new science and engineering\rcurriculum and iPads/Chromebooks in the classrooms, on-site training is being provided twice monthly to meet the specific needs of our students and\rteachers. Our vertical teams of teachers meet monthly to determine areas of need for professional learning.  These teams are the facilitators and or\rpresenters.  The professional learnings occur the first week teachers return to school. and the first and third Wednesdays after school. This year, we are\rusing personalized professional development (ed camp style) opportunity where teachers are given time to improve their skills in their areas of interest,\rspecifically as it relates to  literacy, mathematics, restorativepractices andinquiry-based instruction.
