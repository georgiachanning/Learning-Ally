We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative. Teacher\rleaders facilitated a training on the NGSS Science and Engineering Practice of Modeling and phenomena-based instruction.\rThe focus of 2017-18 professional development was on the implementation of a new TK-5th grade math program: Bridges in Mathematics.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$53,526$49,378School Site-$10,776.92$4,251.32$6,525.60$72,916.03\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$78,104$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,542.17$74,413.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$94,809$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$130,315$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$155,467$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$220,996$189,346\rSchool Site/District-0.3-2.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-14.0-6.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative. Teacher\rleaders facilitated a training on the NGSS Science and Engineering Practice of Modeling and phenomena-based instruction.\rThe focus of 2017-18 professional development was on the implementation of a new TK-5th grade math program: Bridges in Mathematics.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$53,526$49,378School Site-$10,776.92$4,251.32$6,525.60$72,916.03\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$78,104$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,542.17$74,413.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$94,809$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$130,315$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$155,467$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$220,996$189,346\rSchool Site/District-0.3-2.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-14.0-6.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher. Additionally, we have a cadre of literacy coaches who\rare in their second year of working with their colleagues in supporting the implementation of Reading and Writing Workshop.\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, teachers received training on Implicit Bias and Compassionate Dialogue as a part of our district Equity Initiative.

We kicked off the year with an inservice on Culturally Responsive Teaching as a part of our Equity and Inclusion initiative. Our\rOctober professional development day was led by a cadre of teacher leaders who introduced their colleagues to the History-Social Science Standards\rdriving questions and the importance of including the counternarrative in their teaching. Our final professional development day of 2019-20 took the\rform of a mini-conference in which teachers shared expertise on a variety of topics including Low Floor/High Ceiling Math Tasks, Sensory Integration\rTechniques, Examining Implicit Bias, and Tier One Strategies for the General Education Teacher.
