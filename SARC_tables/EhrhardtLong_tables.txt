The rigor and\rbreadth of the instructional program, safety of the campus, and warmth of the learning environment are the key components\rin ensuring success for each child in meeting the standards for their grade. Opportunities for both individual and collaborative\rlearning exist in every classroom and support implementation of the California Common Core State Standards. Our success\rin implementing our mission can be further evidenced through our school's special strengths, including: a commitment to\rmeeting each child's needs through differentiated instruction within the classroom, a dedicated "WIN-What I Need"\rdifferentiation block each day, and communication with parents in ways that allow them to partner with the school to improve\rtheir child's performance. Parent support and involvement continue to be important aspects of the student success at John\rEhrhardt Elementary.\rOur Parent Teacher Organization, Watch D.O.G.S., and parent advisories provide opportunities for involvement. Parent\rvolunteers serve as essential support for the development of programs and policies that benefit our students. Parents also\rsupport student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework, and by sending a clear message\rthat regular on time school attendance is important.\rThe physical and emotional safety of our students is a school-wide priority and Positive Behavior Supports and Interventions\rsupport our students as they are safe, responsible, and respectful. Citizenship and academic success is celebrated at\rmonthly assemblies, with Eagle tickets and weekly prize drawings. The atmosphere of the school makes our students feel\rcomfortable and secure.\rMarianne Williams, Principal\rJohn Ehrhardt Elementary                        Unnamed: 0

The rigor and\rbreadth of the instructional program, safety of the campus, and warmth of the learning environment are the key components\rin ensuring success for each child in meeting the standards for their grade. Opportunities for both individual and collaborative\rlearning exist in every classroom and support implementation of the California Common Core State Standards. Our success\rin implementing our mission can be further evidenced through our school's special strengths, including: a commitment to\rmeeting each child's needs through differentiated instruction within the classroom, a dedicated "WIN-What I Need"\rdifferentiation block each day, and communication with parents in ways that allow them to partner with the school to improve\rtheir child's performance. Parent support and involvement continue to be important aspects of the student success at John\rEhrhardt Elementary.\rOur Parent Teacher Organization, Watch D.O.G.S., and parent advisories provide opportunities for involvement. Parent\rvolunteers serve as essential support for the development of programs and policies that benefit our students. Parents also\rsupport student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework, and by sending a clear message\rthat regular on time school attendance is important.\rThe physical and emotional safety of our students is a school-wide priority and Positive Behavior Supports and Interventions\rsupport our students as they are safe, responsible, and respectful.

The rigor and\rbreadth of the instructional program, safety of the campus, and warmth of the learning environment are the key components\rin ensuring success for each child in meeting the standards for their grade. Opportunities for both individual and collaborative\rlearning exist in every classroom and support implementation of the California Common Core State Standards. Our success\rin implementing our mission can be further evidenced through our school's special strengths, including: a commitment to\rmeeting each child's needs through differentiated instruction within the classroom, a dedicated "WIN-What I Need"\rdifferentiation block each day, and communication with parents in ways that allow them to partner with the school to improve\rtheir child's performance. Parent support and involvement continue to be important aspects of the student success at John\rEhrhardt Elementary.\rOur Parent Teacher Organization, Watch D.O.G.S., and parent advisories provide opportunities for involvement. Parent\rvolunteers serve as essential support for the development of programs and policies that benefit our students. Parents also\rsupport student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework, and by sending a clear message\rthat regular on time school attendance is important.\rThe physical and emotional safety of our students is a school-wide priority and Positive Behavior Supports and Interventions\rsupport our students as they are safe, responsible, and respectful.

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rNone applicable.  ...

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5
