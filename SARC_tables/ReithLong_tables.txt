We provide a unique and wonderful educational experience for children, starting with the\rsafety of the campus, and continuing with the warmth of our learning environment. We are proud of our after-school program,\r“Jaguar Club,” where students continue their academic day with enrichment activities and homework help. Our goal is to\rclose the achievement gap, and create a child who is college, trade school, career ready and life ready. We will do this with\rfour focus areas. We focus on our child’s social and emotional needs. Our school continues to provide outstanding services\rwith our PBIS Program, counsellors, mental health therapists and school psychologist. We use data to support the\rintervention needs of every child. We involve and collaborate with our parent community to enhance our school programs.\rWe partner with our families to create a learning environment that best meets every child’s needs. Lastly, every teacher on\rour campus provides our students with high quality instruction. We commit to learning and growing daily to provide each\rchild with the needed tools to be successful in our school and into their future. We pride ourselves on family and community\rengagement. Families are encouraged to join us for our themed spirit days, Family Lunch Days, College and Career Faire, or\rafter school events: Harvest Festival, Family Make and Take Academic Nights, Talent Show, Art Night Ice-Cream Social,\rand Holiday Festivities.

We involve and collaborate with our parent community to enhance our school programs.\rWe partner with our families to create a learning environment that best meets every child’s needs. Lastly, every teacher on\rour campus provides our students with high quality instruction. We commit to learning and growing daily to provide each\rchild with the needed tools to be successful in our school and into their future. We pride ourselves on family and community\rengagement. Families are encouraged to join us for our themed spirit days, Family Lunch Days, College and Career Faire, or\rafter school events: Harvest Festival, Family Make and Take Academic Nights, Talent Show, Art Night Ice-Cream Social,\rand Holiday Festivities.

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are resolved by either the\rschool custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a\rdaily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering\rschool grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary.\rThe Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Our school prides itself on staying clean\rand in good repair.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rWith the recent passage of Measure M in November, 2016's election, our school will receive upgrades in flooring, security\rcomponents, and technology. Our school underwent construction to replace the roofs on many of our buildings on site.  ... Unnamed: 2

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are resolved by either the\rschool custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a\rdaily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering\rschool grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary.\rThe Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Our school prides itself on staying clean\rand in good repair.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rWith the recent passage of Measure M in November, 2016's election, our school will receive upgrades in flooring, security\rcomponents, and technology. Our school underwent construction to replace the roofs on many of our buildings on site.  ... Unnamed: 2

[2 rows x 4 columns],   Overall Facility (School Year 2019 - 2020)\rYear and month of the most recent FIT report: 8/21/2019\rOverall Rating\rExemplaryGoodFairPoor\rx\rThe district’s maintenance and grounds departments work in connection with the school site custodial team to ensure that\rschool buildings, classrooms, and grounds are maintained at exceptional levels to provide a safe and functional environment\rfor all students. The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are resolved by either the\rschool custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a\rdaily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering\rschool grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary.\rThe Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. Our school prides itself on staying clean\rand in good repair.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rWith the recent passage of Measure M in November, 2016's election, our school will receive upgrades in flooring, security\rcomponents, and technology. Our school underwent construction to replace the roofs on many of our buildings on site.

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the\rtotal number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                 Unnamed: 5
