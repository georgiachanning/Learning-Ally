For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.

For the past four years, the district has sponsored three staff development days annually where teachers are offered a broad-based\rvariety of professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies.\r\rThe administration along with the teachers of Tom Matsumoto Elementary School seek out opportunities to travel offsite to attend workshops,\rconferences, and inservices with the understanding that those staff members will bring back information to share with all staff. As we implement the\rCommon Core State Standards, our focus has been on shifts in teaching strategies, observation of deployment of the CCSS in other schools and districts,\rand the practical of use of technology for problem solving, critical thinking, and testing.\r\rThe administration has been instrumental in helping our teachers and staff understand best teaching practices and helps to ensure that teachers feel\rsupported in the classroom. The administrator is available to support classroom instruction, works with teachers at weekly staff meetings, and discuss\rgoals regularly to ensure needs are being addressed.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$56,010$45,741School Site-$6,000$286$5,714$102,823\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$90,633$81,840-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,818$94,781.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$104,878$102,065-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,663.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$138,740$129,221\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$141,310$132,874Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$128,660\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$191,425$224,581\rSchool Site/District-52.87.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-22.023.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries42%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rIn addition to general state funding, all schools within Evergreen School District received state and federal categorical funding for the following support\rprograms:\r•\rLCAP funds or Supplemental Funds\r•\rTitle I, Targeted Assistance (for these schools: LeyVa, Dove Hill, Holly Oak, Katherine Smith, Montgomery, and O.B.
