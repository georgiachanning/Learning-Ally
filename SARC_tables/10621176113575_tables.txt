It allows our staff to learn about new trends in education and to refine existing programs in accordance with current research. Annually,\rstudent-assessment results and input from the School-Based Coordinated Program (SBCP) Needs Assessment Survey identifies staff-development\rpriorities and supports the goals for achievement of the School Site Plan (SSP). Long-range plans are drawn to provide continuity and differentiated\rinstruction to ensure all students reach levels of proficiency or above.\r\rProfessional development is ongoing to ensure our staff keeps abreast of new learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques, and applied technology\rin the field of education. A monthly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rAn effective process for staff development and curriculum improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrators. Topics relevant to\rthe needs and priorities of the school are identified early in the year, and monthly staff-development sessions are scheduled accordingly. It should also\rbe pointed out that CUSD offers a New Teacher Training Academy for beginning teachers. This is a two-year program targeted at five performance areas.\r\rDuring the 2019-20 school year, Cedarwood staff is focusing on reading and math. In reading, teachers are receiving continued training on close reading\rstrategies.

Teachers are also\rworking to build students’ confidence when working with math. They are providing students strategies to help them solve math problems. These\rprofessional development opportunities are monthly. Teachers also use data to guide their instruction throughout the school year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs: first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the Common Core State and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\r\rIn the 2019-20 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.
