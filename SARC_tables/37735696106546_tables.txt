This instructional focus is embedded in the professional development opportunities at Reynolds. In\raddition, there is a focus on language arts instruction in order to support student achievement in these areas.\r\rThe teaching staff at Reynolds Elementary is diligent in utilizing the professional development opportunities to further develop their instructional\rpractice.  Teachers participate in Professional Learning Community meetings with their grade level partners.  These meetings are structured to monitor\revery students' academic progress in reading and mathematics and to support teachers in developing lessons that support the learning of the Common\rCore State Standards.\r\rProfessional Development opportunities are scheduled prior to the start of school each year and in January to facilitate designated curriculum\rinstructional planning for the teaching staff.\r\rThe focus of our professional development has been on the Common Core State Standards through teachers participation in district workshops to gain\ran understanding of what students are expected to learn in K-12 Mathematics and English Language Arts. Teachers are provided time through\rProfessional Learning Community meetings and through release time to plan and develop instruction implementing the new Common Core Standards\rbased upon the knowledge obtained through the district workshops.\r\rTeachers offer support to their colleagues by collaborating on the implementation of the CCSS through PLC meetings with the school principal.\rAssessments are the guide to support student learning which is an ongoing measure of teaching and learning.  MAP testing (Measures of Academic\rProgress) results are compiled at the end of each trimester to help evaluate student progress in grades 2-5. Kindergarten and first grade teachers utiltize\rdistrict assessment results at the end of each trimester to measure student growth in reading and mathematics. Every student is assessed in reading\rthroughout the school year and students receive targeted guided reading based upon their instructional level.  ... Unnamed: 11
