The District provides or coordinates on-going training based on needs identified through student performance indicators,\rincluding results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, District\riReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding specific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for\rStudent Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences that allow them to\rgrow professionally and provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading intervention\rand technology as well as follow-up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration\ron student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom-based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching\rimplemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and\rMapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning, 21st Century\rClassroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning,\rand Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all-day workshops, after-school workshops and meetings, individual\rcoaching/mentoring, and off-site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers.

Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading intervention\rand technology as well as follow-up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration\ron student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom-based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching\rimplemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and\rMapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning, 21st Century\rClassroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning,\rand Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all-day workshops, after-school workshops and meetings, individual\rcoaching/mentoring, and off-site conferences.

Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading intervention\rand technology as well as follow-up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration\ron student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom-based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching\rimplemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and\rMapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning, 21st Century\rClassroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning,\rand Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all-day workshops, after-school workshops and meetings, individual\rcoaching/mentoring, and off-site conferences.

Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences that allow them to\rgrow professionally and provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading intervention\rand technology as well as follow-up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration\ron student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom-based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching\rimplemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and\rMapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning, 21st Century\rClassroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning,\rand Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all-day workshops, after-school workshops and meetings, individual\rcoaching/mentoring, and off-site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review\rProgram is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the District calendar includes a\rcollaboration day schedule each week to allow for on-going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.\r\r\rState Average for\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesDistrict\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rCategory DistrictAmount State Average for\rCategory\rDistricts In Same\rAmount\rTeacher Salaries37%35%\rCategory\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\rBeginning Teacher Salary$48,457$51,374\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,801$80,151Benefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,526$100,143\r\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$120,328$126,896\rFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$125,053$133,668\rAverage\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$143,664$143,746\rLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rSuperintendent Salary$248,434$245,810Salary\r\rSchool Site-11499.575361.936137.6473273.97\rD---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A6597.81$80,166.00\rS- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00

quality, research-based professional development is essential to continuous improvement of\rteaching skills and concepts. The District provides or coordinates on-going training based on needs identified through student performance indicators,\rincluding results of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, District\riReady benchmark assessments, and input from sites regarding specific needs. Professional development is aligned with the District Strategic Plan for\rStudent Achievement and Board goals. Teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators participate in workshops, and conferences that allow them to\rgrow professionally and provide opportunities for collegial sharing. Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading intervention\rand technology as well as follow-up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration\ron student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom-based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching\rimplemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and\rMapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning, 21st Century\rClassroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning,\rand Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all-day workshops, after-school workshops and meetings, individual\rcoaching/mentoring, and off-site conferences. The Induction (formerly BTSA) program provides support to new teachers. The Peer Assistance and Review\rProgram is available to provide support to teachers in the areas of content knowledge and teaching strategies. Currently, the District calendar includes a\rcollaboration day schedule each week to allow for on-going teacher dialogue and collaboration to meet student needs.\r\r\rState Average for\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesDistrict\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rCategory DistrictAmount State Average for\rCategory\rDistricts In Same\rAmount\rTeacher Salaries37%35%\rCategory\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\rBeginning Teacher Salary$48,457$51,374\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,801$80,151Benefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,526$100,143\r\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$120,328$126,896\rFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$125,053$133,668\rAverage\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$143,664$143,746\rLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rSuperintendent Salary$248,434$245,810Salary\r\rSchool Site-11499.575361.936137.6473273.97\rD---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A6597.81$80,166.00\rS- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00

Regular meetings of teacher leaders in literacy, mathematics, reading intervention\rand technology as well as follow-up coaching support full implementation of training. Additionally, each school provides time for teacher collaboration\ron student achievement data, curriculum development, and review of classroom-based performance measures. Examples of workshops and coaching\rimplemented as the result of analysis of student achievement include: Effective Teaching Strategies, Classroom Management, Curriculum Alignment and\rMapping, English Language Development, AVID, Thinking Maps, Positive Behavior Intervention Support, Social Emotional Learning, 21st Century\rClassroom Technology, Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Modeling Academic Language, Universal Design for Learning,\rand Parent Engagement. Staff members participate in professional development in all-day workshops, after-school workshops and meetings, individual\rcoaching/mentoring, and off-site conferences.
