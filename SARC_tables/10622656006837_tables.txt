Teachers attend an additional five days. Three days are for professional development. The remaining\rtwo days are used for staff meetings and room preparation.\r\rProfessional development at Riverview Elementary School is designed to meet the individual needs of teachers as well as broader school concerns.\rProfessional development may take the form of training, coaching, peer observation, or constructive self-reflection and are consistent with our school\rvision and goals. Principal, teachers, instructional aides, and other support personnel may take part in these activities.\r\rFor the 17-18 and 18-19 school years, staff studied researched based best instructional practices, learner engagement strategies, and lesson design to\rmeet the needs of students performing below proficiency. Staff, grade level, and vertical team meetings also provide regularopportunities for\rprofessional collaboration, as do district data analysis and interpretation committee meetings. A professional learning community continues to meet\rthroughout the school year to plan, implement, observe, and reflect on instructional strategies. The district provides early release of students every\rWednesday to allow teachers time to reflect on the Cycle of Inquiry, including review of student data, planning instruction, and collaboration. Teachers\rreceived specific training at the August Buy-Back days. District instructional coaches followed-up with additional training days, observations, modeling\rand feedback. Riverview administration also participated in this staff development. Administrators work on teams to observe their site teachers and\rteachers at other sites to provide feedback.  All ELA teachers were trained throughout the year on "Write from the Beginning and Beyond."  The "Write\rfrom the Beginning" training were held approximately one Wednesday each month for the last several years.   Several teachers also participated in NGSS\rtraining.\r\rIn 2019-2020 in addition to the district provided professional development, Riverview staff participated in Autism Training and Safety Care Training.  We\rcontinue to focus on Collaborative Teams and data analysis to the individual student level.  School-wide we have placed a focus on Math RtI and utilize\rdata to drive the instruction during this time.  Four teachers have joined the NGSS team and participate in trainings and lesson studies around Science.\rRiverview Elementary School continues to emphasize collaborative team building, assessment and data collection, and effective teaching strategies in its\rprofessional development program. Staff, grade level, and vertical team meetings also provide regular opportunities for professional collaboration, as\rdo district meetings. Teachers attend various conferences and workshops based on teacher needs. Buy-back and early release days provide time for\rquality professional development and collaboration.  Wednesday early release days are utilized for Grade Level Collaboration Meetings and district Write\rfrom the Beginning Training.\r\rRiverview also continues to engage in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), assessment and data collection, and effective teaching strategies, with\rcontinuousmonitoringofoursignificantsubgroups:StudentsWithDisabilities,EnglishLanguageLearners,Hispanic,andSocio-economically\rDisadvantaged. To supplement student learning, the Riverview staff received training on ways to use "Thinking Maps" as an instructional strategy.\r\rKCUSD Special Education Department provides monthly staff development for special education teachers and professional development for special\reducation techs through-out the school year.

Teachers attend an additional five days. Three days are for professional development. The remaining\rtwo days are used for staff meetings and room preparation.\r\rProfessional development at Riverview Elementary School is designed to meet the individual needs of teachers as well as broader school concerns.\rProfessional development may take the form of training, coaching, peer observation, or constructive self-reflection and are consistent with our school\rvision and goals. Principal, teachers, instructional aides, and other support personnel may take part in these activities.\r\rFor the 17-18 and 18-19 school years, staff studied researched based best instructional practices, learner engagement strategies, and lesson design to\rmeet the needs of students performing below proficiency. Staff, grade level, and vertical team meetings also provide regularopportunities for\rprofessional collaboration, as do district data analysis and interpretation committee meetings. A professional learning community continues to meet\rthroughout the school year to plan, implement, observe, and reflect on instructional strategies. The district provides early release of students every\rWednesday to allow teachers time to reflect on the Cycle of Inquiry, including review of student data, planning instruction, and collaboration. Teachers\rreceived specific training at the August Buy-Back days. District instructional coaches followed-up with additional training days, observations, modeling\rand feedback. Riverview administration also participated in this staff development. Administrators work on teams to observe their site teachers and\rteachers at other sites to provide feedback.  All ELA teachers were trained throughout the year on "Write from the Beginning and Beyond."  The "Write\rfrom the Beginning" training were held approximately one Wednesday each month for the last several years.   Several teachers also participated in NGSS\rtraining.\r\rIn 2019-2020 in addition to the district provided professional development, Riverview staff participated in Autism Training and Safety Care Training.  We\rcontinue to focus on Collaborative Teams and data analysis to the individual student level.  School-wide we have placed a focus on Math RtI and utilize\rdata to drive the instruction during this time.  Four teachers have joined the NGSS team and participate in trainings and lesson studies around Science.\rRiverview Elementary School continues to emphasize collaborative team building, assessment and data collection, and effective teaching strategies in its\rprofessional development program. Staff, grade level, and vertical team meetings also provide regular opportunities for professional collaboration, as\rdo district meetings. Teachers attend various conferences and workshops based on teacher needs. Buy-back and early release days provide time for\rquality professional development and collaboration.  Wednesday early release days are utilized for Grade Level Collaboration Meetings and district Write\rfrom the Beginning Training.\r\rRiverview also continues to engage in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), assessment and data collection, and effective teaching strategies, with\rcontinuousmonitoringofoursignificantsubgroups:StudentsWithDisabilities,EnglishLanguageLearners,Hispanic,andSocio-economically\rDisadvantaged.
