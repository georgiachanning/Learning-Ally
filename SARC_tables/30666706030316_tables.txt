Staff\rdevelopment concentrations are selected and identified based upon student assessment results, teacher input, state content standards, and professional\rdevelopment surveys. Multiple Teared Systems of Support (MTSS) staff development has been an addition in the last couple of years to assist our students\rthrough specific interventions. Professional development has occurred through after-school workshops, workshops attended through organizations such\ras CABE, district workshops, and individual mentoring (particularly in special education).\r\rAll staff development activities at Santa Ana Unified School District are focused on increasing student learning and proficiency.
