To help with their efforts, our Campus\rBeautification and Garden Academy are in full effect with our students and teachers monitoring the cleanliness of our school\rgrounds. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff arrival. Restrooms are inspected\rthroughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked and sanitary. Logs are kept in all bathrooms. Monthly facilities\rcheck lists are completed and approved. Areas of need are immediately addressed to ensure that our students and staff are\rprovided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for\rall schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school or district offices.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rPriorities identified at Donner: • Major building systems upgrades including heating and air conditioning, alarms and intercom\rsystem. • Security measures including camera systems • Technology improvements • Restroom renovations • Play field and\rplayground improvements • Drinking fountains • Interior and exterior paint • Carpeting and flooring improvements Project\rpriorities will be determined by the Board of Education. Not all priorities are guaranteed.  ... Unnamed: 2

[3 rows x 4 columns],   Overall Facility (School Year 2019 - 2020)\rYear and month of the most recent FIT report: 12/3/2019\rOverall Rating\rExemplaryGoodFairPoor\rx\rOur custodial crew takes pride in the cleanliness and maintenance of our school. To help with their efforts, our Campus\rBeautification and Garden Academy are in full effect with our students and teachers monitoring the cleanliness of our school\rgrounds. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff arrival. Restrooms are inspected\rthroughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked and sanitary. Logs are kept in all bathrooms. Monthly facilities\rcheck lists are completed and approved. Areas of need are immediately addressed to ensure that our students and staff are\rprovided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for\rall schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school or district offices.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rPriorities identified at Donner: • Major building systems upgrades including heating and air conditioning, alarms and intercom\rsystem. • Security measures including camera systems • Technology improvements • Restroom renovations • Play field and\rplayground improvements • Drinking fountains • Interior and exterior paint • Carpeting and flooring improvements Project\rpriorities will be determined by the Board of Education. Not all priorities are guaranteed.  ... Unnamed: 2

To help with their efforts, our Campus\rBeautification and Garden Academy are in full effect with our students and teachers monitoring the cleanliness of our school\rgrounds. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff arrival. Restrooms are inspected\rthroughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked and sanitary. Logs are kept in all bathrooms. Monthly facilities\rcheck lists are completed and approved. Areas of need are immediately addressed to ensure that our students and staff are\rprovided with a clean, safe, and functional learning environment. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for\rall schools in the district. A summary of these standards is available at the school or district offices.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rPriorities identified at Donner: • Major building systems upgrades including heating and air conditioning, alarms and intercom\rsystem. • Security measures including camera systems • Technology improvements • Restroom renovations • Play field and\rplayground improvements • Drinking fountains • Interior and exterior paint • Carpeting and flooring improvements Project\rpriorities will be determined by the Board of Education.

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5

The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the\rtotal number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                 Unnamed: 5
