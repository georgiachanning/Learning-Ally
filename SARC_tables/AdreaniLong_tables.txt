All aspects of the\rschool contribute to providing children with the skills they need to be successful learners.\rOur district's mission is to provide a learning community that challenges ALL students to realize their greatest potential. We\rfocus on supporting our students in reaching our district's bold goals.\rThrough the efforts of our staff, students and families, we have maintained the highest CAASPP scores in EGUSD under the\rrigor of the California Common Core Standards in English/Language Arts and Math. We know our students will continue to\rachieve at the highest level and appreciate the Adreani community's commitment to strong academics.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths: Positive\rBehavior Intervention Systems (PBIS), physical education, technology instruction, high expectations for all students and\rGATE. In addition, we frequently celebrate students for their behavioral and academic success. Parent support and\rinvolvement are part of the foundation that contributes to the success of Arnold Adreani Elementary. Some serve as\rclassroom or library volunteers, while others plan family events and activities. Parents also support student success by\rproviding space, time and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear message that education and regular\rschool attendance are important to the family. Staff and students alike deeply appreciate the contributions of our community.\rThe safety of our students is this school's first priority and the discipline policy is strictly enforced. We emphasize safe,\rrespectful, and responsible behavior...we call this, "The Wildhawk Way." All adults visiting the campus are required to check\rin through the school office. This is all part of our priority of making students feel comfortable and secure on campus.\rMark Vierra, Principal\rArnold Adreani Elementary School                       Unnamed: 0

All aspects of the\rschool contribute to providing children with the skills they need to be successful learners.\rOur district's mission is to provide a learning community that challenges ALL students to realize their greatest potential. We\rfocus on supporting our students in reaching our district's bold goals.\rThrough the efforts of our staff, students and families, we have maintained the highest CAASPP scores in EGUSD under the\rrigor of the California Common Core Standards in English/Language Arts and Math. We know our students will continue to\rachieve at the highest level and appreciate the Adreani community's commitment to strong academics.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths: Positive\rBehavior Intervention Systems (PBIS), physical education, technology instruction, high expectations for all students and\rGATE. In addition, we frequently celebrate students for their behavioral and academic success. Parent support and\rinvolvement are part of the foundation that contributes to the success of Arnold Adreani Elementary. Some serve as\rclassroom or library volunteers, while others plan family events and activities. Parents also support student success by\rproviding space, time and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear message that education and regular\rschool attendance are important to the family. Staff and students alike deeply appreciate the contributions of our community.\rThe safety of our students is this school's first priority and the discipline policy is strictly enforced.

All aspects of the\rschool contribute to providing children with the skills they need to be successful learners.\rOur district's mission is to provide a learning community that challenges ALL students to realize their greatest potential. We\rfocus on supporting our students in reaching our district's bold goals.\rThrough the efforts of our staff, students and families, we have maintained the highest CAASPP scores in EGUSD under the\rrigor of the California Common Core Standards in English/Language Arts and Math. We know our students will continue to\rachieve at the highest level and appreciate the Adreani community's commitment to strong academics.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths: Positive\rBehavior Intervention Systems (PBIS), physical education, technology instruction, high expectations for all students and\rGATE. In addition, we frequently celebrate students for their behavioral and academic success. Parent support and\rinvolvement are part of the foundation that contributes to the success of Arnold Adreani Elementary. Some serve as\rclassroom or library volunteers, while others plan family events and activities. Parents also support student success by\rproviding space, time and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear message that education and regular\rschool attendance are important to the family. Staff and students alike deeply appreciate the contributions of our community.\rThe safety of our students is this school's first priority and the discipline policy is strictly enforced.

All aspects of the\rschool contribute to providing children with the skills they need to be successful learners.\rOur district's mission is to provide a learning community that challenges ALL students to realize their greatest potential. We\rfocus on supporting our students in reaching our district's bold goals.\rThrough the efforts of our staff, students and families, we have maintained the highest CAASPP scores in EGUSD under the\rrigor of the California Common Core Standards in English/Language Arts and Math. We know our students will continue to\rachieve at the highest level and appreciate the Adreani community's commitment to strong academics.\rOur success in implementing our district's mission can be evidenced through our school's special strengths: Positive\rBehavior Intervention Systems (PBIS), physical education, technology instruction, high expectations for all students and\rGATE. In addition, we frequently celebrate students for their behavioral and academic success. Parent support and\rinvolvement are part of the foundation that contributes to the success of Arnold Adreani Elementary. Some serve as\rclassroom or library volunteers, while others plan family events and activities. Parents also support student success by\rproviding space, time and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a clear message that education and regular\rschool attendance are important to the family. Staff and students alike deeply appreciate the contributions of our community.\rThe safety of our students is this school's first priority and the discipline policy is strictly enforced. We emphasize safe,\rrespectful, and responsible behavior...we call this, "The Wildhawk Way." All adults visiting the campus are required to check\rin through the school office.

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the lead custodian inspects the school prior to students and\rstaff entering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe,\rand sanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these\rstandards is available at the school office, or at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rThis year, through the approval of Measure M, our campus will be receiving a shade structure that is slated to be constructed\rnear the play structure.  ...

A summary of these\rstandards is available at the school office, or at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rThis year, through the approval of Measure M, our campus will be receiving a shade structure that is slated to be constructed\rnear the play structure.

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5
