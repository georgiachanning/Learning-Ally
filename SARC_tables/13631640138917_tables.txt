The school’s programs focus on preparing students to think conceptually, communicate effectively, and apply skills in real-world\rcontexts. Curriculum and instructional strategies that foster critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and academic skills are consistently taught to\rthe students to ensure work-readiness skills.\r\rImperial High School prepares students for the work force through exposure to life skills curriculum in economics/civics classes. Skills such as writing\rresumes, preparing for interviews, filling out applications, balancing checking accounts, and budgeting are taught. Expected School Wide Learning Results\r(ESLR’s) guide curricular programs, preparing students for post secondary careers and education. Imperial High School’s ESLR’s are as follows: T.I.G.E.R -\rT- Team Players, I - Investigative People, G - Global Citizens, E - Effective Communicators, R - Responsible Students.\r\rCollege and military recruiters visit the campus at various times throughout the school year to provide information to students. Students also attend\rnumerous college fairs. Imperial High School is participating in the early outreach program with the University of California which involves tutoring,\rmentoring, academic preparation, and college counseling. School counselors provide additional academic, career, and personal counseling. Imperial High\rSchool also participates in outreach programs such as Talent Search, M.E.S.A. (Mathematics-Engineering-Science-Achievement)\r\rCourses are evaluated by employment readiness standards, business/community stakeholder support, and placement of students in employment, post-\rsecondaryeducation,orthemilitary.AllcareerpreparationcoursesincorporateCTEcurriculumstandardsandsatisfythedistrict’sgraduation\rrequirement. The following Regional Occupation Program and Career Technology courses offered to Imperial High School students: Ag Mechanics II, Food\rTechnology, Fire Science, Interior Design, Medical Terminology, Retail Trades, Graphic Design, Nursing Assistant, Ag Science, Ag Mechanics, and\rVeterinarian Science.\r\rRogelio Ruvalcaba  is the primary contact for Imperial Unified School District’s Career Technical Committee. The chart displays information about student\rparticipation in Imperial High School’s Career Technical Education (CTE) programs\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length\rof time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print\rdocuments.

The school’s programs focus on preparing students to think conceptually, communicate effectively, and apply skills in real-world\rcontexts. Curriculum and instructional strategies that foster critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and academic skills are consistently taught to\rthe students to ensure work-readiness skills.\r\rImperial High School prepares students for the work force through exposure to life skills curriculum in economics/civics classes.
