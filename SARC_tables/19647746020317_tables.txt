The need for additional mathematics professional development was identified by\rthe underperformance of students district-wide on the CAASPP assessment. To address this need, teachers in grades 4-6 also received Swum Math\rProfessional Development and coaching to deliver math supports to supplement Core math instruction and increase student achievement.\r\rTeachers attend multiple professional developments throughout the school year to help students close the achievement gap and develop Intervention\rplans. Using the common assessment data for English learners (ELs), students with disabilities (SWD), and other strategic subgroups are used to provide\rstudents with intervention during the school day to raise academic achievement. Wilson provides intensive students, including ELs and SWD, with\rstrategic interventions during the day and an extended day after school intervention. The professional development is provided by the school site and\rdistrict staff during early release days and pupil free days. Teachers also collaborate during Data Reflection Sessions and monthly Guided Planning\rSessions.

The need for additional mathematics professional development was identified by\rthe underperformance of students district-wide on the CAASPP assessment. To address this need, teachers in grades 4-6 also received Swum Math\rProfessional Development and coaching to deliver math supports to supplement Core math instruction and increase student achievement.\r\rTeachers attend multiple professional developments throughout the school year to help students close the achievement gap and develop Intervention\rplans. Using the common assessment data for English learners (ELs), students with disabilities (SWD), and other strategic subgroups are used to provide\rstudents with intervention during the school day to raise academic achievement.
