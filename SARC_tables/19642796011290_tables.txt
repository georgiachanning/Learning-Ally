Grade level teams are provided partial day release time every 6 weeks (each grade level meets on a different day) and two early release days\reach month to participate in Professional Learning Communities where teams hold data-driven conversations focused on student learning and planning\rhow they will respond to the data. Professional development opportunities are delivered through grade level collaborations, after school trainings, and\rconference attendance. Teachers are supported during implementation through in-class coaching, teacher-principal meetings, and collaborations with\rcolleagues. Teachers are also provided the needed instructional materials and technology to implement strategies and practices acquired through\rprofessional development.\r\rThe district annually holds professional development days in which teachers are offered a broad-based variety of professional learning opportunities in\rcurriculum and instructional practice in support of a continuous cycle of improvement. Professional learning opportunities include grade level and/or\rcontent-specific programming on full and partial days as well as after-school opportunities. Student achievement data continues to be the determining\rfactor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last three years have been in the area of\rsupporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history-social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as well as the use\rof student data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district staff, Teachers on Special Assignment, as\rwellasconsultantsandcoacheswhospecializeincontent-areapedagogy.Professionallearningisstructuredinjob-embeddedworkshopsand\rprofessional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and coaching support, and student\rwork/data analysis.

In addition, several opt-in days\rof various ongoing professional learning offerings were held to differentiate among grade and content levels and included standards-aligned instructional\rpractices in support of all learners, including English learners and students with disabilities; college and career readiness; and social-emotional support.  ...

Grade level teams are provided partial day release time every 6 weeks (each grade level meets on a different day) and two early release days\reach month to participate in Professional Learning Communities where teams hold data-driven conversations focused on student learning and planning\rhow they will respond to the data. Professional development opportunities are delivered through grade level collaborations, after school trainings, and\rconference attendance.
