After reviewing summative and formative data, including test scores, student, parent, and staff surveys, and outcomes related to school\rculture and social-emotional learning, district and site leaders along with content teams of lead teachers identify areas of districtwide focus for teacher\rand administrator professional development. This year, areas of focus include\r•Implementing our CCSS-aligned ELA curriculum to maximize impact\r•Refining the teaching of writing to meet the expectations of the Common Core\r•Using common assessments to evaluate writing\r•Expanding our understanding the Standards for Mathematical Practice\r•Designated English Language Development, especially for newcomers and long-term English Learners\r•Supporting students with special needs\r\rProfessional learning occurs through a variety of methodologies. During our six professional development days, teachers attend workshops in which they\rlearn instructional techniques, analyze their students’ work, and collaboratively plan to implement the new techniques. Teacher leaders are occasionally\rsubbed out to attend “trainer of trainers” sessions, which they then facilitate for their peers across the district. Teachers and administrators often avail\rthemselves of workshops and trainings provided by Los Angeles County Office of Education, universities, curriculum publishers, and private education\rentities. Site principals provide individualized coaching and feedback on classroom teaching. Our new teachers who are eligible are encouraged to join\rthe Beginning Teacher Support and Assistance (BTSA)/Induction program, through which they receive mentoring from experienced peers. Each August,\rteachers new to the district attend an orientation which introduces them to key curriculum and initiatives in our district. Both ELD/Intervention specialists\rand special education teachers have a professional learning session once per month to share best practices, analyze data, and align on processes and\rprocedures related to the student groups they serve. Site principals come together monthly for a full day Professional Learning Community and also\rconduct regular learning walks to provide peer feedback on site priorities.\r\rIn addition, the school has 75 minutes of professional development during two “late starts” each month and weekly grade level collaboration time.\rJanson school has been able to continue to provide professional development in Google classroom, Google Apps, and attend Computers Using Educators\rconferences. Janson also continues to participate in The Leader in Me Coaching and community days and iReady coaching and continues to utilize staff\rmeeting time to provide support in areas such as Google Apps, TLIM, iReady and intervention strategies.  ...

After reviewing summative and formative data, including test scores, student, parent, and staff surveys, and outcomes related to school\rculture and social-emotional learning, district and site leaders along with content teams of lead teachers identify areas of districtwide focus for teacher\rand administrator professional development. This year, areas of focus include\r•Implementing our CCSS-aligned ELA curriculum to maximize impact\r•Refining the teaching of writing to meet the expectations of the Common Core\r•Using common assessments to evaluate writing\r•Expanding our understanding the Standards for Mathematical Practice\r•Designated English Language Development, especially for newcomers and long-term English Learners\r•Supporting students with special needs\r\rProfessional learning occurs through a variety of methodologies. During our six professional development days, teachers attend workshops in which they\rlearn instructional techniques, analyze their students’ work, and collaboratively plan to implement the new techniques. Teacher leaders are occasionally\rsubbed out to attend “trainer of trainers” sessions, which they then facilitate for their peers across the district. Teachers and administrators often avail\rthemselves of workshops and trainings provided by Los Angeles County Office of Education, universities, curriculum publishers, and private education\rentities. Site principals provide individualized coaching and feedback on classroom teaching. Our new teachers who are eligible are encouraged to join\rthe Beginning Teacher Support and Assistance (BTSA)/Induction program, through which they receive mentoring from experienced peers. Each August,\rteachers new to the district attend an orientation which introduces them to key curriculum and initiatives in our district. Both ELD/Intervention specialists\rand special education teachers have a professional learning session once per month to share best practices, analyze data, and align on processes and\rprocedures related to the student groups they serve. Site principals come together monthly for a full day Professional Learning Community and also\rconduct regular learning walks to provide peer feedback on site priorities.\r\rIn addition, the school has 75 minutes of professional development during two “late starts” each month and weekly grade level collaboration time.\rJanson school has been able to continue to provide professional development in Google classroom, Google Apps, and attend Computers Using Educators\rconferences. Janson also continues to participate in The Leader in Me Coaching and community days and iReady coaching and continues to utilize staff\rmeeting time to provide support in areas such as Google Apps, TLIM, iReady and intervention strategies.  ...
