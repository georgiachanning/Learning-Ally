Teachers were working on developing student self-efficacy through clear expectations of student success and\rdeveloping relationships. For the 2019-2020 school year, data revealed the need to focus on the language development of all students. Collaborative\rconversations/discussions have been the focus of our PLCs this year. Additionally, Clear View has become a Leader in Me school and has dedicated\rprofessional develop time and resources to making this transition.\r\rOur school professional development around collaborative conversations has been largely directed by our Instructional Leadership Team (ILT), made up\rfrom one teacher at each grade level.  Throughout each quarter our ILT team meets during school hours and develops a professional learning cycle based\ron articles or research about our topic. Each PLC includes staff meeting topics, collaboration focus, guided classroom visits, and opportunities for vertical\rarticulation within the staff.  During Bi-Monthly in school collaboration, teachers build their learning on topics related to our PLC, share resources, plan\rlessons, and analyze student work/data.\r\rTeachers are supported through continual professional development and principal feedback based on teacher needs.  Additionally, student data is\rregularly used to guide next steps in our learning as teachers.  As a Leader in Me school, our staff has received two full day trainings from Leader in Me\rtrainers and we have created a Lighthouse team which meets regularly and provides professional development for the staff.\r\rAs a site, we will work with our ILT and district support to focus professional development for teachers on collaborative conversations and implementation\rof high impact language strategies with fidelity.  Our Professional development plan will continue to include in school ILT meetings, staff meetings on\rFriday early release days, during bi-monthly collaboration.  Teachers will be supported with this implementation through feedback and coaching from\rthe principal based on student formal and informal data.  In addition, our District Resource Teacher will continue to provide resources for teachers, model\rlessons, and support with planning and implementation.  ... Unnamed: 6

Teachers were working on developing student self-efficacy through clear expectations of student success and\rdeveloping relationships. For the 2019-2020 school year, data revealed the need to focus on the language development of all students. Collaborative\rconversations/discussions have been the focus of our PLCs this year. Additionally, Clear View has become a Leader in Me school and has dedicated\rprofessional develop time and resources to making this transition.\r\rOur school professional development around collaborative conversations has been largely directed by our Instructional Leadership Team (ILT), made up\rfrom one teacher at each grade level.  Throughout each quarter our ILT team meets during school hours and develops a professional learning cycle based\ron articles or research about our topic. Each PLC includes staff meeting topics, collaboration focus, guided classroom visits, and opportunities for vertical\rarticulation within the staff.  During Bi-Monthly in school collaboration, teachers build their learning on topics related to our PLC, share resources, plan\rlessons, and analyze student work/data.\r\rTeachers are supported through continual professional development and principal feedback based on teacher needs.  Additionally, student data is\rregularly used to guide next steps in our learning as teachers.  As a Leader in Me school, our staff has received two full day trainings from Leader in Me\rtrainers and we have created a Lighthouse team which meets regularly and provides professional development for the staff.\r\rAs a site, we will work with our ILT and district support to focus professional development for teachers on collaborative conversations and implementation\rof high impact language strategies with fidelity.  Our Professional development plan will continue to include in school ILT meetings, staff meetings on\rFriday early release days, during bi-monthly collaboration.  Teachers will be supported with this implementation through feedback and coaching from\rthe principal based on student formal and informal data.  In addition, our District Resource Teacher will continue to provide resources for teachers, model\rlessons, and support with planning and implementation.  ... Unnamed: 11
