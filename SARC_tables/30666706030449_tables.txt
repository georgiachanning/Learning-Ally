All teachers attended training to implement the\rrecently-adopted Houghton-Mifflin Math Expressions curriculum (4 full days) and supplemental Irvine Math Project lessons (12 full days - 2 per grade\rlevel).  Grades K - 3 teachers received professional development on SIPPS to use as replacement for the phonics component of Open Court Reading,\rdistrict-adopted ELA curriculum (2 full days).  All teachers received professional development in writing, three times during the year (6 partial days).\r\rIn 2018-19, Wilson teachers received professional development in two key areas:  1) mathematics - Irvine Math Project training (6 full days)  and  2)\rimplementation of Benchmark Advance, newly adopted ELA/ELD curriculum for grades K - 5 (8 full days).  Mathematics was selected as an area of\rprofessional growth by the Instructional Leadership based on multiple measures data analysis: 2017/18 CAASPP SBAC Math, MAP math and District\rbenchmark assessments'results.Grade-level teamsparticipatedin2three-hour professional conversationssessions,followingFallandWinter\radministrations of the MAP Math assessment (6 partial days).   All staff received training on school safety and emergency procedures (1 full day).  Activity\rMonitors received 5 training sessions on the following topics: team building strategies, student mediation and problem-solve, communication with\rstudents, communication with parents and student engagement (1 full day).\r\rFor the current school year, 2019/20, prior to the first day of instruction, all staff received training on school safety and emergency procedures (1 partial\rday).  In addition, all teachers districtwide were required to participate in MTSS professional development (1 partial day).   For 2019/20, the school has\ridentified Mathematics as a major area for professional growth and development.   All teachers are required to participate in Benchmark Advance ELD\rtraining to implement both, integrated and designated ELD instruction, daily.   Teachers will receive training and coaching on the new components of ST\rMath (1 partial day), Irvine Math Project (8 partial days), and the use of student mathematical discourse to explain their reasoning and develop problem-\rsolving skills.   As indicated by data collected from various 2018/19 District and State assessments, last year Wilson made significant growth in\rmathematics (compared to the prior year, 2017/18); however, overall math scores continue to be lower than overall reading scores across all grade-\rlevels.  Teachers will participate in professional conversations sessions with the principal two times for an hour, to analyze students/class math data,\rdetermine progress, and plan differentiated instruction, based on student needs (4 partial days).  At the beginning of the year teachers in grades K- 3\rwere required to attend DIBELS 8th Edition training.  DIBELS 8th Edition (most recent edition) is used districtwide to assess and monitor students' progress\rin reading (K - 3) (2 partial days).  As indicated in the 2019/20 School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA), teachers in grades 4 and 5 will complete AVID\rEssentials training to support students with research-based strategies to develop 21st Century skills and prepare them for college and careers (4 full\rdays).  ...

All teachers attended training to implement the\rrecently-adopted Houghton-Mifflin Math Expressions curriculum (4 full days) and supplemental Irvine Math Project lessons (12 full days - 2 per grade\rlevel).  Grades K - 3 teachers received professional development on SIPPS to use as replacement for the phonics component of Open Court Reading,\rdistrict-adopted ELA curriculum (2 full days).  All teachers received professional development in writing, three times during the year (6 partial days).\r\rIn 2018-19, Wilson teachers received professional development in two key areas:  1) mathematics - Irvine Math Project training (6 full days)  and  2)\rimplementation of Benchmark Advance, newly adopted ELA/ELD curriculum for grades K - 5 (8 full days).  Mathematics was selected as an area of\rprofessional growth by the Instructional Leadership based on multiple measures data analysis: 2017/18 CAASPP SBAC Math, MAP math and District\rbenchmark assessments'results.Grade-level teamsparticipatedin2three-hour professional conversationssessions,followingFallandWinter\radministrations of the MAP Math assessment (6 partial days).   All staff received training on school safety and emergency procedures (1 full day).  Activity\rMonitors received 5 training sessions on the following topics: team building strategies, student mediation and problem-solve, communication with\rstudents, communication with parents and student engagement (1 full day).\r\rFor the current school year, 2019/20, prior to the first day of instruction, all staff received training on school safety and emergency procedures (1 partial\rday).  In addition, all teachers districtwide were required to participate in MTSS professional development (1 partial day).   For 2019/20, the school has\ridentified Mathematics as a major area for professional growth and development.   All teachers are required to participate in Benchmark Advance ELD\rtraining to implement both, integrated and designated ELD instruction, daily.   Teachers will receive training and coaching on the new components of ST\rMath (1 partial day), Irvine Math Project (8 partial days), and the use of student mathematical discourse to explain their reasoning and develop problem-\rsolving skills.   As indicated by data collected from various 2018/19 District and State assessments, last year Wilson made significant growth in\rmathematics (compared to the prior year, 2017/18); however, overall math scores continue to be lower than overall reading scores across all grade-\rlevels.  Teachers will participate in professional conversations sessions with the principal two times for an hour, to analyze students/class math data,\rdetermine progress, and plan differentiated instruction, based on student needs (4 partial days).  At the beginning of the year teachers in grades K- 3\rwere required to attend DIBELS 8th Edition training.  DIBELS 8th Edition (most recent edition) is used districtwide to assess and monitor students' progress\rin reading (K - 3) (2 partial days).  As indicated in the 2019/20 School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA), teachers in grades 4 and 5 will complete AVID\rEssentials training to support students with research-based strategies to develop 21st Century skills and prepare them for college and careers (4 full\rdays).  ...
