All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives.
