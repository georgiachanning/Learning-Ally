Our high\rquality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies.\rIn 2012-13, we established district-wide K-12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional\rdevelopment offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math\rInitiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS and professional learning\rofferings.\r\rThese learning experiences are supported with on-site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches\rreceived certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one-to-one coaching, team and grade level\rcoaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross-grade level, cross-discipline professional development sessions. These\rtrainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, formative assessment for\rlearning, and lesson design.\r\rIn addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach-led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting.\rThese cohorts are both semester-long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for\rInnovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.\r\rWe ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive\rtrainings along with on-going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework\rfor Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.\r\rUnder the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content\rknowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every\rstaff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.  ... Unnamed: 6

Our high\rquality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies.\rIn 2012-13, we established district-wide K-12 Task Forces in English language arts, mathematics, and other content areas along with targeted professional\rdevelopment offerings. We hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and the Silicon Valley Math\rInitiative. Both organizations are highly respected and have strong ties to the development and implementation of the CCSS and professional learning\rofferings.\r\rThese learning experiences are supported with on-site coaching provided by a team of instructional coaches who work and train together. The coaches\rreceived certification as Common Core trainers through the Leadership and Learning Center. They provide one-to-one coaching, team and grade level\rcoaching, whole school professional development, in addition to targeted cross-grade level, cross-discipline professional development sessions. These\rtrainings connect to every aspect of school practice: relevant and rigorous curriculum, intentional instructional practices, formative assessment for\rlearning, and lesson design.\r\rIn addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach-led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting.\rThese cohorts are both semester-long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for\rInnovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously.\r\rWe ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project (formerly known as BTSA). Our summer intensive\rtrainings along with on-going staff development days and release day trainings deeply align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework\rfor Excellence: Supporting Students and their Learning; Supporting Staff and their Work.\r\rUnder the leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content\rknowledge, strengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every\rstaff member helps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.  ... Unnamed: 11
