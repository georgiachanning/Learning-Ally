The school plays an integral part in the lives of the families, the\rneighboring businesses and the surrounding community. The quaint, rustic looking town of Julian is located sixty miles\rnortheast of San Diego, and is an extremely popular tourist retreat throughout the year. Known as the apple country, the\rold fashioned, picturesque towns privacy and close knit community atmosphere is highly valued by the local townspeople,\rmany of whose families have lived in the area for several generations. Julian Union is a school district consisting of one\relementary and one junior high school. Since the attendance area encompasses 618.6 square miles, and its boundaries go\r--------from the desert floor to the top of the mountains, the school buses provide the lifeline between students and the schools.\rJulian Union Elementary SchoolThe community income is derived mainly from cattle ranching, apple farming, and tourism. Many parents commute off the\rmountain to work in the city since the community has no large business or industry. The school district is the largest\rDistrict\remployer in the community. The population has remained fairly constant the last few years, although the expectations for\r1704 Cape Horn\rfuture growth, looms on the horizon.\rJulian, CA 92036\r\r(760) 765-0661\rMISSION STATEMENT “There is a child behind everything we do.”\rhttps://sites.google.com/a/juesd.net/Our Mission is...

Julian Union is a school district consisting of one\relementary and one junior high school. Since the attendance area encompasses 618.6 square miles, and its boundaries go\r--------from the desert floor to the top of the mountains, the school buses provide the lifeline between students and the schools.\rJulian Union Elementary SchoolThe community income is derived mainly from cattle ranching, apple farming, and tourism.

Known as the apple country, the\rold fashioned, picturesque towns privacy and close knit community atmosphere is highly valued by the local townspeople,\rmany of whose families have lived in the area for several generations. Julian Union is a school district consisting of one\relementary and one junior high school. Since the attendance area encompasses 618.6 square miles, and its boundaries go\r--------from the desert floor to the top of the mountains, the school buses provide the lifeline between students and the schools.\rJulian Union Elementary SchoolThe community income is derived mainly from cattle ranching, apple farming, and tourism. Many parents commute off the\rmountain to work in the city since the community has no large business or industry. The school district is the largest\rDistrict\remployer in the community. The population has remained fairly constant the last few years, although the expectations for\r1704 Cape Horn\rfuture growth, looms on the horizon.\rJulian, CA 92036\r\r(760) 765-0661\rMISSION STATEMENT “There is a child behind everything we do.”\rhttps://sites.google.com/a/juesd.net/Our Mission is...

The school plays an integral part in the lives of the families, the\rneighboring businesses and the surrounding community. The quaint, rustic looking town of Julian is located sixty miles\rnortheast of San Diego, and is an extremely popular tourist retreat throughout the year. Known as the apple country, the\rold fashioned, picturesque towns privacy and close knit community atmosphere is highly valued by the local townspeople,\rmany of whose families have lived in the area for several generations. Julian Union is a school district consisting of one\relementary and one junior high school. Since the attendance area encompasses 618.6 square miles, and its boundaries go\r--------from the desert floor to the top of the mountains, the school buses provide the lifeline between students and the schools.\rJulian Union Elementary SchoolThe community income is derived mainly from cattle ranching, apple farming, and tourism. Many parents commute off the\rmountain to work in the city since the community has no large business or industry. The school district is the largest\rDistrict\remployer in the community. The population has remained fairly constant the last few years, although the expectations for\r1704 Cape Horn\rfuture growth, looms on the horizon.\rJulian, CA 92036\r\r(760) 765-0661\rMISSION STATEMENT “There is a child behind everything we do.”\rhttps://sites.google.com/a/juesd.net/Our Mission is...
