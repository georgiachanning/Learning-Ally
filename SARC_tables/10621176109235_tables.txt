A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade\rlevel through our Professional Learning Community and Data Team process.\r\rPinedale’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge and applica tion of technology through Google Classroom,\ras well as analysis of student assessment results through implementing effective professional learning communities (PLCs) to better inform instruction.\rPinedale is in its fifth year of implementation of AVID Elementary, and our newest strand of AVID is focused on Culturally Relevant Teaching (CRT). We\rare also focusing staff development on Trauma Informed Practices as many of our students are coming in with more social-emotional issues. Teachers\rnew to the profession are supported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers. All\rteachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as at tendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\r\rIn the 2018-19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.\r\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade\rlevel through our Professional Learning Community and Data Team process.\r\rPinedale’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge and applica tion of technology through Google Classroom,\ras well as analysis of student assessment results through implementing effective professional learning communities (PLCs) to better inform instruction.\rPinedale is in its fifth year of implementation of AVID Elementary, and our newest strand of AVID is focused on Culturally Relevant Teaching (CRT). We\rare also focusing staff development on Trauma Informed Practices as many of our students are coming in with more social-emotional issues. Teachers\rnew to the profession are supported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers. All\rteachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as at tendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\r\rIn the 2018-19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.\r\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.
