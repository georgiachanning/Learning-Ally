Based upon our\r\rSchool Plan for Student Achievement, School Site Councils members (five parents,\rNancy Hipolito\rthree teachers, one administrator and one classified employee) will visit all classrooms\rAssistant Superintendent\rto evaluate what every teacher is doing around program quality. We do this because\rHuman Resources\rwe want to meet the state requirement for meeting or exceeding the standards on the\rSBAC.\rGregory Fromm\r\rChief Business Official\r\rLincoln Elementary School prides itself in involving the parents and community members in every\raspect of our school. We welcome visitors on our campus for many different reasons, including\rParent Visitation Days for the different curriculum areas, Awards Assemblies, Family Math, Literacy\rNights, Multicultural Assemblies, and other special events. We believe that parents, community\rmembers, and staff must collaboratively work together to make an impact in student academic\rprogress. We are very proud of our fine traditions and school pride at Lincoln Elementary School.\r\rGeraldine Rescinito, PRINCIPAL

Based upon our\r\rSchool Plan for Student Achievement, School Site Councils members (five parents,\rNancy Hipolito\rthree teachers, one administrator and one classified employee) will visit all classrooms\rAssistant Superintendent\rto evaluate what every teacher is doing around program quality. We do this because\rHuman Resources\rwe want to meet the state requirement for meeting or exceeding the standards on the\rSBAC.\rGregory Fromm\r\rChief Business Official\r\rLincoln Elementary School prides itself in involving the parents and community members in every\raspect of our school. We welcome visitors on our campus for many different reasons, including\rParent Visitation Days for the different curriculum areas, Awards Assemblies, Family Math, Literacy\rNights, Multicultural Assemblies, and other special events.

Based upon our\r\rSchool Plan for Student Achievement, School Site Councils members (five parents,\rNancy Hipolito\rthree teachers, one administrator and one classified employee) will visit all classrooms\rAssistant Superintendent\rto evaluate what every teacher is doing around program quality. We do this because\rHuman Resources\rwe want to meet the state requirement for meeting or exceeding the standards on the\rSBAC.\rGregory Fromm\r\rChief Business Official\r\rLincoln Elementary School prides itself in involving the parents and community members in every\raspect of our school. We welcome visitors on our campus for many different reasons, including\rParent Visitation Days for the different curriculum areas, Awards Assemblies, Family Math, Literacy\rNights, Multicultural Assemblies, and other special events.

Based upon our\r\rSchool Plan for Student Achievement, School Site Councils members (five parents,\rNancy Hipolito\rthree teachers, one administrator and one classified employee) will visit all classrooms\rAssistant Superintendent\rto evaluate what every teacher is doing around program quality. We do this because\rHuman Resources\rwe want to meet the state requirement for meeting or exceeding the standards on the\rSBAC.\rGregory Fromm\r\rChief Business Official\r\rLincoln Elementary School prides itself in involving the parents and community members in every\raspect of our school. We welcome visitors on our campus for many different reasons, including\rParent Visitation Days for the different curriculum areas, Awards Assemblies, Family Math, Literacy\rNights, Multicultural Assemblies, and other special events.
