These professional development\rdays are aligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan.  The Marengo staff, along with the other elementary school staffs,\rparticipate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.  Finally, our Technology Integration Coach works individually and with small groups of teachers on\rprofessional development and instructional technology in the classroom.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,783$46,208School Site-$10,641$2,766$7,875$80,915\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$80,620$72,218D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,645$84,070.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$112,570$92,742-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$72,949.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$117,445$134,864\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$120,284$118,220Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$147,000$127,356\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$240,443$186,823\rSchool Site/District3.0-4.3\r\rSchool Site/ State7.512.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%33%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

These professional development\rdays are aligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan.  The Marengo staff, along with the other elementary school staffs,\rparticipate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).

Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.

Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.  Finally, our Technology Integration Coach works individually and with small groups of teachers on\rprofessional development and instructional technology in the classroom.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,783$46,208School Site-$10,641$2,766$7,875$80,915\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$80,620$72,218D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,645$84,070.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$112,570$92,742-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$72,949.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$117,445$134,864\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$120,284$118,220Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$147,000$127,356\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$240,443$186,823\rSchool Site/District3.0-4.3\r\rSchool Site/ State7.512.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%33%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

These professional development\rdays are aligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan.  The Marengo staff, along with the other elementary school staffs,\rparticipate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).

These professional development\rdays are aligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan.  The Marengo staff, along with the other elementary school staffs,\rparticipate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.

These professional development\rdays are aligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan.  The Marengo staff, along with the other elementary school staffs,\rparticipate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.

Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.

These professional development\rdays are aligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan.  The Marengo staff, along with the other elementary school staffs,\rparticipate. Topics that have been addressed include Common Core State Standards (CCSS), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), English Language\rArts curriculum, the evaluation of student writing, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), examination of multiple measures, differentiated learning\rstrategies, Thinking Maps, curriculum mapping and Project-Based Learning (PBL).\r\rStaff development is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, during grade level release-time and through attendance at various conferences.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans address teaching standards agreed upon\rby teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade level meetings at the school site and district-wide, data analysis meetings and peer planning meetings\rallow for teachers to learn from their peers.
