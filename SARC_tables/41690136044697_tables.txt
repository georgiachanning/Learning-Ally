In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.

In the 2018-2019 school year, teachers\rused SBAC data to identify areas of growth on which to focus. Listening and Speaking was a common area of growth across grade levels. Teachers met in\rdepartments throughout the school year to review and discuss progress in this area, as well as identify needs for their department.\rThis was done on Site-designated Early Release Days. Teacher directed early release days were used for teacher planning and collaboration. Professional\rdevelopment days were also used to provide teachers with additional training that reinforced the areas of focus. Integrated ELD strategies, particularly\rin regards to speaking and listening, was provided to all grades and subjects.
