Institute week in August was used to do follow-up trainings around the Key Learning Principles,\rreading-comprehension strategies, and the new reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

Institute week in August was used to do follow-up trainings around the Key Learning Principles,\rreading-comprehension strategies, and the new reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

Institute week in August was used to do follow-up trainings around the Key Learning Principles,\rreading-comprehension strategies, and the new reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.

The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.

Institute week in August was used to do follow-up trainings around the Key Learning Principles,\rreading-comprehension strategies, and the new reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

Institute week in August was used to do follow-up trainings around the Key Learning Principles,\rreading-comprehension strategies, and the new reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\r\rState Average for\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In Same\rAmountState Average for\rDistrict Category\r\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,914$48,612Category\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$64,773$74,676Teacher Salaries34%34%\rHighest Teacher Salary$87,991$99,791Administrative Salaries5%5%\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$109,974$125,830\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$113,593$131,167\r\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$124,720$144,822\r\rSuperintendent Salary$230,000$275,796  ...

Institute week in August was used to do follow-up trainings around the Key Learning Principles,\rreading-comprehension strategies, and the new reading series, Benchmark Literacy. The staff learned about some of the strategies from the Positive\rBehavioral Interventions and Sup ports (PBIS) program and incorporated them in our schoolwide discipline system. Miramonte Staff will also participate\rin training with AVID, as well as Trauma Informed Schools to support students in ALL areas of need.\r\rAs an ongoing professional development, after three years of building Internal Coherence, the teachers will participate in Instructional Rounds with a\rfocus on reading comprehension. This process allows teachers to conduct peer observations, discuss their findings and make recommendations for\roverall school improvement. Teachers also attend several workshops provided by the District’s Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Department,\rtechnology trainings and state conferences each year.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.
