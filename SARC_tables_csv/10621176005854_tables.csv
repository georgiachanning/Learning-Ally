A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.

Dry Creek staff abreast of new learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques and applied technology\rin the field of education. A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.

Dry Creek staff abreast of new learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques and applied technology\rin the field of education. A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\r\rState Average for\rDistrict CategoryState Average for District\r\rDistricts In Same AmountDistricts In Same\rPercent of District Budget\rAmount Category\r\rCategory\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,914$48,612\rTeacher Salaries34%34%\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$64,773$74,676\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\rHighest Teacher Salary$87,991$99,791*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$109,974$125,830\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$113,593$131,167\r\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)\r$124,720$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$230,000$275,796

Dry Creek staff abreast of new learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques and applied technology\rin the field of education. A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\r\rState Average for\rDistrict CategoryState Average for District\r\rDistricts In Same AmountDistricts In Same\rPercent of District Budget\rAmount Category\r\rCategory\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,914$48,612\rTeacher Salaries34%34%\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$64,773$74,676\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\rHighest Teacher Salary$87,991$99,791*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$109,974$125,830\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$113,593$131,167\r\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)\r$124,720$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$230,000$275,796  ...

A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days.

Dry Creek staff abreast of new learning strategies, innovative teaching techniques and applied technology\rin the field of education. A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\r\rState Average for\rDistrict CategoryState Average for District\r\rDistricts In Same AmountDistricts In Same\rPercent of District Budget\rAmount Category\r\rCategory\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,914$48,612\rTeacher Salaries34%34%\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$64,773$74,676\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\rHighest Teacher Salary$87,991$99,791*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$109,974$125,830\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$113,593$131,167\r\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)\r$124,720$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$230,000$275,796  ...

A weekly planning opportunity is provided for teachers to coordinate and plan lessons or units as an entire grade level.\r\rDry Creek’s professional development currently focuses on improving our collective knowledge of curriculum and needed changes in instructional\rdelivery. Our third- through sixth-grade classes participated in the third statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment tests in the spring of 2019. The Dry\rCreek students performed well on the assessments in comparison to all schools in CUSD, and this school year’s fourth- through sixth-grade teachers are\rusing the results to engage students in meaningful conversations about areas of strength and growth. As students become more familiar with this new\rrigorous assessment system, we believe our students will rise to the challenge and demonstrate mastery of the California State Standards.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are sup-ported by a formal mentoring system, which includes release time to observe lessons taught by veteran teachers.\rAll teachers are encouraged to participate in external professional improvement opportunities, such as attendance at conferences and workshops.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.
