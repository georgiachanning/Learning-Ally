Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.

Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.

Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.

School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

for Teachers\r\rMeasure2017-182018-192019-20\rNumber of school days dedicated to Staff Development and Continuous Improvement161818\r\rWednesday afternoons are a busy time at Gardenhill Elementary School, and it is on our Wednesday shortened days that Gardenhill staff meets in grade\rlevel teams, and as a staff, learning and becoming better instructional leaders.  Wednesdays are also a vital time for team planning.  The primary areas\rof focus for Wednesday staff developments focus around three areas: Common Core Standards, Common Core Assessments (formative and summative),\rand STEM Education.  Gardenhill teachers have spent many hours unpacking the Common Core standards during staff meetings and substitute days to\rmake sure they understand the level of complexity needed and the skills and knowledge needed for students to meet the new standards.  Additionally,\rNLMUSD has adopted a new Common Core Mathematics textbook (Houghton Mifflin Math Expressions), Benchmark Advance ELA curriculum, writing\rmaterials (Lucy Calkin's Writing Units, and foundational K - 2 phonics materials.   To ensure Gardenhill students are meeting grade level essential\rstandards, Gardenhill grade level teams also meet every other Thursday as a professional learning community during the school day to analyze data,\rdiscuss which students have met the essential standard, and plan for our daily intervention block.  We continue this cycle by writing SMART goals for our\rformative and summative assessments.   Addtionally,  Gardenhill teachers are diving into Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) education\rusing the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Launch curriculum.  11 teachers were trained in the past in San Diego as PLTW lead teachers. Building level training\rtook place with all K - 5 teachers, and we continue to develop our knowledge on project-based learning during the year and in the Next Generation\rScience Standards.  Grades K - 5 will have a minimum of two STEM modules this year.  As you can see, Gardenhill values staff development, and we\rbelieve in learning and growing as professionals.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-11260.122751.358508.7894859.33\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-7.57.2\r\rSchool Site/ State12.514.5\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...
