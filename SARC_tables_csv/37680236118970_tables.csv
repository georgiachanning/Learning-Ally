While these teachers are providing instruction in these areas,\rclassroom teachers are given the opportunity to collaborate and review instructional practices, as well as receive professional development in identified\rareas of need.\r\r\rOur 2017-18 professional development is focused on 3 Reads Protocol and Guided Language Acquisition Development (GLAD).\r\rOur 2018-19 professional development focused on learning intentions, success criteria, high impact language development strategies, and Sanford\rHarmony.\r\rOur 2019-2020 professional development focused on conditions of the problem, high impact language development strategies and using accountable\rtalk across all grade levels and all curricula using a professional learning cycle.\r\rProfessional development (PD) delivery:  PD has been provided via a variety of methods including, but not limited to:\r•on site staff meetings;\r•reciprocal teacher observation;\r•professional texts and readings;\r•professional development provided by the district;\r•resource teacher modeled and/or coached, as needed through January 2019, when she was promoted to a position at the district office; and,\r•feedback and modeling provided by administration\r\rTeacher support during implementation:\r•Teachers are encouraged to implement these new instructional strategies and observed through the lens of safe practice.\r•Teachers receive instructional feedback via regular walkthroughs or regularly scheduled observations by administration, and are encouraged\rnot only to consider next steps but to share their findings within their grade levels and system-wide.\r•Biweekly observation findings are shared during professional development meetings and in grade-level collaboration.\r•Quarterly student monitoring, regular observations of student learning and teacher practice are discussed with each teacher where we share\rstrategies and next steps for instructional plans for growth for each child.\r•A compilation of student progress is shared regularly with staff for consideration of adjustments in their practice.\r•Quarterly instructional conferences are held with teachers to discuss instructional suggestions/strategies and techniques and open up to\rquestions or feedback they may seek.  ...
