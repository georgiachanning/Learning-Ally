Principal, teachers, instructional aides, and other support personnel may take part in these activities.\r\rIn the 2016-19 school years Dunlap School focused on implementing the newly adopted Engage NY curriculums in both ELA and math.  Training was\rprovided to support teacher implementation and understanding of how they should best utilize these curricular resources.  There was also a focus on\rthe integration and emphasis of targeted vocabulary through the use of response frames and front loading activities.  These practices were adopted to\rsupport all student learning, especially English Language Learners.  Regular grade level PLC meetings serve as a platform for grade level specific trainings\rand the sharing of best practices.  Site based PLC meetings are held every other Wednesday to provide grade level support of direct instruction strategies,\rdata collection and ongoing common core training and support.  Teachers are allowed release time to plan for instruction/intervention and to observe\rother teacher's lessons at other school sites.\r\rIn the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years Dunlap School contracted with the English Learner Group who provided training on the ELD Framework and\rStandards.  Teachers were taught how to understand the ELD standards and how it fits with the framework in developing designated and integrated\rapproaches to instruction in each content area.\r\rSchool administration performs walkthrough observations daily in each classroom. Monthly goals are established to improve instructional delivery and\rbenefit student achievement. Administration provides real-time coaching during walkthroughs and always provides feedback to teachers.  ... Unnamed: 11

Principal, teachers, instructional aides, and other support personnel may take part in these activities.\r\rIn the 2016-19 school years Dunlap School focused on implementing the newly adopted Engage NY curriculums in both ELA and math.  Training was\rprovided to support teacher implementation and understanding of how they should best utilize these curricular resources.  There was also a focus on\rthe integration and emphasis of targeted vocabulary through the use of response frames and front loading activities.  These practices were adopted to\rsupport all student learning, especially English Language Learners.  Regular grade level PLC meetings serve as a platform for grade level specific trainings\rand the sharing of best practices.  Site based PLC meetings are held every other Wednesday to provide grade level support of direct instruction strategies,\rdata collection and ongoing common core training and support.  Teachers are allowed release time to plan for instruction/intervention and to observe\rother teacher's lessons at other school sites.\r\rIn the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years Dunlap School contracted with the English Learner Group who provided training on the ELD Framework and\rStandards.  Teachers were taught how to understand the ELD standards and how it fits with the framework in developing designated and integrated\rapproaches to instruction in each content area.\r\rSchool administration performs walkthrough observations daily in each classroom. Monthly goals are established to improve instructional delivery and\rbenefit student achievement. Administration provides real-time coaching during walkthroughs and always provides feedback to teachers.  ... Unnamed: 6
