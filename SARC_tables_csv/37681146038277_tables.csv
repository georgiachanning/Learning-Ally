All Science units in Grades K-8 are NGSS aligned. All teachers are supported in\rtheir implementation of new supplemental curriculum, Lingual Learning, to teach English Language Development (ELD).  All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis.

All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis. All teachers are required to attend a minimum of 30 hours of professional development each\ryear.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,133$49,378School Site-$6,935.24$207.95$6,727.29$86,817.00\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,797$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,620.00$86,806.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$102,373$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$124,108$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$130,350$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$285,670$189,346\rSchool Site/District1.60.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-11.011.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries34%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis. All teachers are required to attend a minimum of 30 hours of professional development each\ryear.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,133$49,378School Site-$6,935.24$207.95$6,727.29$86,817.00\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,797$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,620.00$86,806.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$102,373$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$124,108$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$130,350$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$285,670$189,346\rSchool Site/District1.60.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-11.011.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries34%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

All Science units in Grades K-8 are NGSS aligned. All teachers are supported in\rtheir implementation of new supplemental curriculum, Lingual Learning, to teach English Language Development (ELD).  All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis.

All Science units in Grades K-8 are NGSS aligned. All teachers are supported in\rtheir implementation of new supplemental curriculum, Lingual Learning, to teach English Language Development (ELD).  All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis. All teachers are required to attend a minimum of 30 hours of professional development each\ryear.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,133$49,378School Site-$6,935.24$207.95$6,727.29$86,817.00\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,797$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,620.00$86,806.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$102,373$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$124,108$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$130,350$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$285,670$189,346\rSchool Site/District1.60.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-11.011.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries34%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis.

All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis. All teachers are required to attend a minimum of 30 hours of professional development each\ryear.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,133$49,378School Site-$6,935.24$207.95$6,727.29$86,817.00\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,797$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,620.00$86,806.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$102,373$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$124,108$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$130,350$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$285,670$189,346\rSchool Site/District1.60.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-11.011.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries34%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

All Science units in Grades K-8 are NGSS aligned. All teachers are supported in\rtheir implementation of new supplemental curriculum, Lingual Learning, to teach English Language Development (ELD).  All teachers have attended\rstandards-based training in California State Standards Mathematics and English Language Arts, and are in the fifth year implementation of an online\rplanning tool, Lessoneer. The district is in the third year partnership with Discovery Education/STEMformation to support our efforts to redesign teaching\rand learning with a systematic, comprehensive approach for creating and implementing personalized and inquiry-based STEM classrooms. Every school\rsite also developed site-specific professional growth plans that are aligned with the FUESD Blueprint for Student Success 3.0. Each Wednesday is a\rshortened school day devoted to structured teacher collaboration and planning. All teachers and classified staff have been trained in the District's student\rand adult leadership initiative, The Leader in Me, based on Stephen Covey's work in developing the “7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Staff members\rattend training outside of the district facilitated by highly trained and respected professional educators to support the effective implementation of\rinstructional initiatives. During the 2019-20 school year staff attended professional development in the areas of Mathematics Conceptual Understanding,\rSTEM, English Language Development and Data Analysis. All teachers are required to attend a minimum of 30 hours of professional development each\ryear.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,133$49,378School Site-$6,935.24$207.95$6,727.29$86,817.00\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,797$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$6,620.00$86,806.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$102,373$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$124,108$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$130,350$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$285,670$189,346\rSchool Site/District1.60.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-11.011.2\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries34%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.
