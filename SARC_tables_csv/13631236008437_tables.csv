[   Principal’s Message\rPublished January 2020\rI’d like to welcome you to Harding Elementary School’s Annual School Accountability Report Card\rand thank you for taking time to explore it. As principal, I could not be more proud of the school\rover which I preside, and am honored to have the opportunity to share the basis for such pride\rwith you. The purpose of this report card is to afford you further insight into the quality education\rprogram we offer.\rIt is the belief of Harding Elementary School that students will excel in an environment that is\rtailored to their evolving needs, and conducive to all facets of the learning process. It is due to\rthis belief that we have been able to successfully develop a comprehensive education system\rthat promotes cultural diversity, individuality, and intellectual achievement. We strive to provide\rstudents with not only the stimulation and encouragement to accomplish such feats, but the\rmeans to do so as well.\rIn our long-standing tradition of excellence, we maintain our commitment to students, parents,\rcommunity members, and staff to provide the best educational experience possible. We renew\rthis commitment yearly in hopes that together we will continue to improve our effectiveness in\redifying students of today, in order to prepare them to become productive citizens of tomorrow.\rIt is in light of this fact that we welcome any suggestions, ideas, or comments you may have.\rThank you for assisting Harding Elementary School in making our students’ experiences here\rmemorable and enjoyable.\rSchool Behavioral Expectation\rHarding Eagles are a community of respectful learners who make smart choices and persevere\rtowards academic success.\rDistrict & School Description\rTheElCentroElementarySchoolDistrictis\rlocated in Imperial County, and is surrounded by\rStudent Enrollment by\rthousandsofacresofCalifornia’smostStudent Group and Grade Level\rproductive farming land.
