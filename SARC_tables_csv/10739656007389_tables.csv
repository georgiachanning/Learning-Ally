Professional\rdevelopment (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was\rassembled and meets regularly to discuss school-wide progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students and the student population as a whole.\rTeachers also attend workshops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar\rissues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019-2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the Science curriculum and\rproper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math strategies and have hosted\rtraining and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies within the classroom setting at Teague.\r\rTeachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district-wide grade-level collaboration that affords them\ropportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST practices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning\rcommunities, and planning.  Teachers are supported with substitutes if PD is during the day.

Professional\rdevelopment (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was\rassembled and meets regularly to discuss school-wide progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students and the student population as a whole.\rTeachers also attend workshops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar\rissues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019-2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the Science curriculum and\rproper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math strategies and have hosted\rtraining and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies within the classroom setting at Teague.\r\rTeachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district-wide grade-level collaboration that affords them\ropportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST practices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning\rcommunities, and planning.

Professional\rdevelopment (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was\rassembled and meets regularly to discuss school-wide progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students and the student population as a whole.\rTeachers also attend workshops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar\rissues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019-2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the Science curriculum and\rproper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math strategies and have hosted\rtraining and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies within the classroom setting at Teague.\r\rTeachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district-wide grade-level collaboration that affords them\ropportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST practices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning\rcommunities, and planning.

Professional\rdevelopment (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was\rassembled and meets regularly to discuss school-wide progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students and the student population as a whole.\rTeachers also attend workshops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar\rissues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019-2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the Science curriculum and\rproper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math strategies and have hosted\rtraining and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies within the classroom setting at Teague.\r\rTeachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district-wide grade-level collaboration that affords them\ropportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST practices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning\rcommunities, and planning.

Professional\rdevelopment (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was\rassembled and meets regularly to discuss school-wide progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students and the student population as a whole.\rTeachers also attend workshops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar\rissues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019-2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the Science curriculum and\rproper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math strategies and have hosted\rtraining and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies within the classroom setting at Teague.\r\rTeachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district-wide grade-level collaboration that affords them\ropportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST practices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning\rcommunities, and planning.  Teachers are supported with substitutes if PD is during the day.

Professional\rdevelopment (PD) meetings focus on various strategies geared to address the diverse needs of students at Teague Elementary School.  A PBIS team was\rassembled and meets regularly to discuss school-wide progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students and the student population as a whole.\rTeachers also attend workshops and conferences outside of school giving them an opportunity to collaborate with other educators dealing with similar\rissues around school culture and climate.  Also, during the 2019-2020 school year, all teachers are receiving training on using the Science curriculum and\rproper delivery of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Teachers at Teague participate in CGI training regarding math strategies and have hosted\rtraining and provided opportunities for other educators to observe CGI strategies within the classroom setting at Teague.\r\rTeachers at Teague are also provided professional development at the district level through district-wide grade-level collaboration that affords them\ropportunities to address information regarding assessments, BEST practices for effective instruction, differentiation, technology, professional learning\rcommunities, and planning.  Teachers are supported with substitutes if PD is during the day.
