Many factors determine staff develop-ment needs during the 2018-19 school year,\rincluding teacher needs, assessment, and formal and informal discussions between faculty and the administration. Areas of priority include the following.\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading, writing and math using the new textbooks and online support programs for\rstudents\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social sci-ence and science text for reading\rinstruction\r•Use of technology in the classroom to improve lesson engagement and more resources for student learning. Many classes use computers\rand iPods to aid learning in the classroom. Teachers will also be able to take an entire class to the new computer lab for technology-enhanced\rlessons.\r•Supporting instruction provided by our push-in teachers and support staff\r\rTeachers: Professional growth time for teachers is provided each week on early release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student-performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\rTeachers are also supported monthly by individual mentoring and in-class coaching. Teachers are aware of school and district funds that can provide for\rsubstitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level articulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student\rachievement. Programs have focused on teaching writing, reading comprehension and English language development (ELD) curriculum. We also\rimplemented new intervention/reteaching materials for mathematics during class time as well as during our\r\rAfter School Education and Safety (ASES) program.\r\rTeachers attend conferences throughout the year, and upon their return from these conferences, they share valuable information with their colleagues.\rThe district also provides professional growth opportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars.\r\rNew teachers to our school or a grade level receive further support through the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment\r(BTSA) program and through their association with individual support providers.\r\rTarpey places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\rGrade-level leaders and teams have spent time at conferences learning how to develop effective teams as professional learning communities. This\rinformation has helped our students as we focus on common essential standard instruction, data evaluation and strategic intervention support.\r\rTeachers are given extra time to process information gathered from staff development and work with peers toimplement new strategies and\rinstructional practices consistent throughout the grade level and school. Paraprofessionals and other school personnel: Tarpey believes paraprofessionals\rand other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on students and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made\raware of the availability of school and district staff development and training funds. Personnel are invited to attend meetings in which school resources\rare being allocated, participate in forums on current educational topics, attend school committees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.  ...

Many factors determine staff develop-ment needs during the 2018-19 school year,\rincluding teacher needs, assessment, and formal and informal discussions between faculty and the administration. Areas of priority include the following.\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading, writing and math using the new textbooks and online support programs for\rstudents\r•Strategies for improving student achievement in reading comprehension, including utilizing social sci-ence and science text for reading\rinstruction\r•Use of technology in the classroom to improve lesson engagement and more resources for student learning. Many classes use computers\rand iPods to aid learning in the classroom. Teachers will also be able to take an entire class to the new computer lab for technology-enhanced\rlessons.\r•Supporting instruction provided by our push-in teachers and support staff\r\rTeachers: Professional growth time for teachers is provided each week on early release Wednesdays. During this time, teachers share best practices and\rstrategies; review student-performance data to inform instruction, intervention and reteaching; and provide information gleaned from conferences.\rTeachers are also supported monthly by individual mentoring and in-class coaching. Teachers are aware of school and district funds that can provide for\rsubstitutes so that staff may observe other exemplary teachers, meet in grade-level articulation sessions or attend conferences that focus on student\rachievement. Programs have focused on teaching writing, reading comprehension and English language development (ELD) curriculum. We also\rimplemented new intervention/reteaching materials for mathematics during class time as well as during our\r\rAfter School Education and Safety (ASES) program.\r\rTeachers attend conferences throughout the year, and upon their return from these conferences, they share valuable information with their colleagues.\rThe district also provides professional growth opportunities that offer demonstration school forums and educational seminars.\r\rNew teachers to our school or a grade level receive further support through the many workshops of the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment\r(BTSA) program and through their association with individual support providers.\r\rTarpey places strong emphasis on professional growth and provides many formal and informal avenues for teachers to continue their development.\rGrade-level leaders and teams have spent time at conferences learning how to develop effective teams as professional learning communities. This\rinformation has helped our students as we focus on common essential standard instruction, data evaluation and strategic intervention support.\r\rTeachers are given extra time to process information gathered from staff development and work with peers toimplement new strategies and\rinstructional practices consistent throughout the grade level and school. Paraprofessionals and other school personnel: Tarpey believes paraprofessionals\rand other school personnel make a strong and valuable impact on students and their efforts toward educational excellence. All personnel are made\raware of the availability of school and district staff development and training funds. Personnel are invited to attend meetings in which school resources\rare being allocated, participate in forums on current educational topics, attend school committees and be involved in the planning of the yearly program.  ...
