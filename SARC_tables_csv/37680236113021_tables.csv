Activities reflect the school's\rgoals and objectives and are part of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). A variety of data reports are used to analyze growth towards\rmeeting achievement goals as described in the SPSA. Professional Development sessions are held on modified Fridays at school, whole day or half day\rtrainings away from school, and after school on a voluntary basis.\r\rIn 2014-15, staff received PD by attending District academies and sessions provided by the site Resource Teacher.  The ELA focus has evolved to increase\rstudent achievement in reading comprehension by integrating reading and writing, listening, and speaking.  PD is on the implementation of text\rcomplexity, writing from different sources, and explicit and incidental vocabulary.  Professional Development In-services for Achieve 3000 is conducted\rto engage teachers in the full features of this program for 2nd through 6th grades.\r\rThe mathematical focus is to integrate the 8 mathematical practices with the CCSS content standards to increase student achievement.  PD is on the\rimplementation of Eureka Math and conceptual understanding along with student expertise in skills.\r\rThree hours of collaboration time two times per quarter for each grade level is provided for staff to work together in implementing the CCSS in the\rcurriculum.\r\rIn 2015-16, based on CAASPP and local measure data, the school's ELA focus on increasing student achievement in reading comprehension by integrating\rreading, writing, listening, and speaking was continued.  The school Resource Teacher, conducted monthly professional development for staff on the 4T's\r(text structure, text features, text complexity, and implicit/explicit text vocabulary) and the 4E's (evidence, elaboration, example, and explanation) to\rsupport evidence-based responses in both speaking and writing.\r\rIn the area of math, there was a continued focus on the 8 mathematical practices in conjunction with the CCSS to increase student achievement.  All\rteachers attended a summer professional development session in mathematics.  In addition, our school Resource Teacher workedwith staff on\raccountable talk in the classroom with a focus on questioning, prompting, and cueing to increase student discourse.\r\rFurthermore, teachers were supported through multiple trainings with Achieve 3000 representatives to focus on instructional technology to support\rcritical thinking and problem-solving.\r\rTeachers also received three hours of collaboration time two times per quarter for each grade level to work together in implementing the Common Core\rState Standards and specifically focus on the areas of language and math instruction as mentioned above.\r\rIn2016-17,basedonCAASPPandlocalmeasuresdata,theschool'sfocusmovedtowardmathematicalproblem-solvingtoimprovestudents\rachievement.\r\rThe District Resource Teacher met with each grade level every Friday in August and September to ensure all teachers were aware of the available math\rresources and how to use them.  ...

Activities reflect the school's\rgoals and objectives and are part of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA). A variety of data reports are used to analyze growth towards\rmeeting achievement goals as described in the SPSA. Professional Development sessions are held on modified Fridays at school, whole day or half day\rtrainings away from school, and after school on a voluntary basis.\r\rIn 2014-15, staff received PD by attending District academies and sessions provided by the site Resource Teacher.  The ELA focus has evolved to increase\rstudent achievement in reading comprehension by integrating reading and writing, listening, and speaking.  PD is on the implementation of text\rcomplexity, writing from different sources, and explicit and incidental vocabulary.  Professional Development In-services for Achieve 3000 is conducted\rto engage teachers in the full features of this program for 2nd through 6th grades.\r\rThe mathematical focus is to integrate the 8 mathematical practices with the CCSS content standards to increase student achievement.  PD is on the\rimplementation of Eureka Math and conceptual understanding along with student expertise in skills.\r\rThree hours of collaboration time two times per quarter for each grade level is provided for staff to work together in implementing the CCSS in the\rcurriculum.\r\rIn 2015-16, based on CAASPP and local measure data, the school's ELA focus on increasing student achievement in reading comprehension by integrating\rreading, writing, listening, and speaking was continued.  The school Resource Teacher, conducted monthly professional development for staff on the 4T's\r(text structure, text features, text complexity, and implicit/explicit text vocabulary) and the 4E's (evidence, elaboration, example, and explanation) to\rsupport evidence-based responses in both speaking and writing.\r\rIn the area of math, there was a continued focus on the 8 mathematical practices in conjunction with the CCSS to increase student achievement.  All\rteachers attended a summer professional development session in mathematics.  In addition, our school Resource Teacher workedwith staff on\raccountable talk in the classroom with a focus on questioning, prompting, and cueing to increase student discourse.\r\rFurthermore, teachers were supported through multiple trainings with Achieve 3000 representatives to focus on instructional technology to support\rcritical thinking and problem-solving.\r\rTeachers also received three hours of collaboration time two times per quarter for each grade level to work together in implementing the Common Core\rState Standards and specifically focus on the areas of language and math instruction as mentioned above.\r\rIn2016-17,basedonCAASPPandlocalmeasuresdata,theschool'sfocusmovedtowardmathematicalproblem-solvingtoimprovestudents\rachievement.\r\rThe District Resource Teacher met with each grade level every Friday in August and September to ensure all teachers were aware of the available math\rresources and how to use them.  ...
