Extensive time and effort has been put into training on Balanced Math,\rreading and comprehension strategies, structured engagement, and English language development.\r\rProfessional development is based on student, teacher and district needs and programs. Our site focuses trainings and staff development around the\rassessed needs of students and teachers. The staff is actively engaged in on-site staff training sessions each month and can elect to attend additional\rdistrict trainings that are offered weekly, ranging from classroom technology use to lesson design. Professional conferences and county, state and\rnational trainings are also made available. The focus at TK continues to be around solving mathematical problems. An additional focus this year includes\rsocial/ emotional support for staff and students.\r\rThe Induction program connects a beginning teacher with a veteran teacher for mentoring and guidance. Support providers commit to providing service\rto a new teacher for two years in order to help the incoming staff member be successful for students. We have five staff members receiving Induction\rsupport.\r\rIn order to monitor and assess the effectiveness of professional development, teachers are observed formally and in-formally in the classroom. Reflective\rconversations take place between teachers, instructional coaches and administration. Teachers can request in-class coaching, opportunities to participate\rin peer observations, and use district self-assessment tools to advance their own learning. Ultimately, student performance data communicates the\roverall effectiveness of professional development opportunities offered and applied.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school\ryear.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

Extensive time and effort has been put into training on Balanced Math,\rreading and comprehension strategies, structured engagement, and English language development.\r\rProfessional development is based on student, teacher and district needs and programs. Our site focuses trainings and staff development around the\rassessed needs of students and teachers. The staff is actively engaged in on-site staff training sessions each month and can elect to attend additional\rdistrict trainings that are offered weekly, ranging from classroom technology use to lesson design. Professional conferences and county, state and\rnational trainings are also made available. The focus at TK continues to be around solving mathematical problems. An additional focus this year includes\rsocial/ emotional support for staff and students.\r\rThe Induction program connects a beginning teacher with a veteran teacher for mentoring and guidance. Support providers commit to providing service\rto a new teacher for two years in order to help the incoming staff member be successful for students. We have five staff members receiving Induction\rsupport.\r\rIn order to monitor and assess the effectiveness of professional development, teachers are observed formally and in-formally in the classroom. Reflective\rconversations take place between teachers, instructional coaches and administration. Teachers can request in-class coaching, opportunities to participate\rin peer observations, and use district self-assessment tools to advance their own learning. Ultimately, student performance data communicates the\roverall effectiveness of professional development opportunities offered and applied.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school\ryear.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...
