District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential. These programs support\rthe training, development, and retention of high quality teachers using current research on effective teaching and grounds what they are learning in\rdaily practices.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential. These programs support\rthe training, development, and retention of high quality teachers using current research on effective teaching and grounds what they are learning in\rdaily practices.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential. These programs support\rthe training, development, and retention of high quality teachers using current research on effective teaching and grounds what they are learning in\rdaily practices.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential. These programs support\rthe training, development, and retention of high quality teachers using current research on effective teaching and grounds what they are learning in\rdaily practices.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential. These programs support\rthe training, development, and retention of high quality teachers using current research on effective teaching and grounds what they are learning in\rdaily practices.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential.

District teachers and support staff participate in Professional Development Days that are driven by student achievement\rdata, staff learning needs, and research-based best practices. Four District-wide days of professional learning and collaboration for 2018-2019 are\rconcentrated around our academic and whole-child focus areas with an emphasis on English Learners, Foster Youth, and Low-income Pupils. These focus\rareas are in direct alignment with federal, state, and district student achievement academic goals. Additionally, they drive effective instructional\rinterventions to promote students’ academic growth. Each site’s professional development plan is designed collaboratively to address identified student\rachievement and staff needs that are aligned to the District’s focus areas as indicated in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA).\r\rThe District’s Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) facilitate trainings, model best practices, and conduct sessions on lesson design and delivery of\rDistrict focus areas, and other site and District instructional initiatives. A team of TOSAs and veteran teachers serve as the District’s teacher support\rprogram mentors for Garvey’s Teacher Induction Program for participating teachers in the process of clearing their credential. These programs support\rthe training, development, and retention of high quality teachers using current research on effective teaching and grounds what they are learning in\rdaily practices.
