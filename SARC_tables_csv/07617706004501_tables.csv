Three additional staff development were added to the\r2016-17 school calendar for a total of six days.  In 2018-19 teachers were given the option for two additional voluntary PD days.  All K-5 Teachers have\rCommon Planning Time on Mondays with two minimum days scheduled for professional development during the year.  Middle school teachers work in\ra block schedule that provides weekly collaboration time on Wednesday mornings. Teachers at each grade level TK-5 participate in Long Range Planning\r(LRP) Days which focus on using student achievement data to help develop and hone effective instructional strategies and programs.\r\rTeachers have also used LRP time for observing colleagues and utilizing our Literacy, Math, and Technology Teacher Coaches. Teachers also receive\rongoing support and mentoring throughout the year from the Literacy, Math and Technology Coach on special assignment. For 2017-18, the team of\rcoaches helped teachers to focus on improving their instructional practice, developing the opportunities for S.T.E.A.M. based learning, and differentiating\rgrowth opportunities for all teachers. Staff developers from Columbia University Teachers College continue to advance teachers’ skills in Readers and\rWriters Workshop. Outside consultants continue to also provide guidance and support with the implementation of mathematics. Orinda teachers directly\rparticipate in the Bay-Sci program, a partnership with U.C. Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science, which helps develop our NGSS-based Science teaching\rand learning.\r\rSummer training has been offered in the District where teachers receive more specialized training in reading, writing, history-social science, mathematics,\rscience, and technology. Teacher discussion groups and Book Clubs exist at school sites that provide teachers the opportunity to collaboratively share\rprofessional materials of mutual interest. New teachers participate in the Teachers Induction Program through the Contra Costa County Office of\rEducation and includes literacy, math and technology classes.\r\rThe District Technology Coaches model lessons in classrooms, provide classes/ workshops to teachers based upon surveyed needs and interests and\rsupport principals in their efforts to enhance curriculum and instruction through advancing the use of technology and our signature practices in classroom\rinstruction.  ...

Three additional staff development were added to the\r2016-17 school calendar for a total of six days.  In 2018-19 teachers were given the option for two additional voluntary PD days.  All K-5 Teachers have\rCommon Planning Time on Mondays with two minimum days scheduled for professional development during the year.  Middle school teachers work in\ra block schedule that provides weekly collaboration time on Wednesday mornings. Teachers at each grade level TK-5 participate in Long Range Planning\r(LRP) Days which focus on using student achievement data to help develop and hone effective instructional strategies and programs.\r\rTeachers have also used LRP time for observing colleagues and utilizing our Literacy, Math, and Technology Teacher Coaches. Teachers also receive\rongoing support and mentoring throughout the year from the Literacy, Math and Technology Coach on special assignment. For 2017-18, the team of\rcoaches helped teachers to focus on improving their instructional practice, developing the opportunities for S.T.E.A.M. based learning, and differentiating\rgrowth opportunities for all teachers. Staff developers from Columbia University Teachers College continue to advance teachers’ skills in Readers and\rWriters Workshop. Outside consultants continue to also provide guidance and support with the implementation of mathematics. Orinda teachers directly\rparticipate in the Bay-Sci program, a partnership with U.C. Berkeley and Lawrence Hall of Science, which helps develop our NGSS-based Science teaching\rand learning.\r\rSummer training has been offered in the District where teachers receive more specialized training in reading, writing, history-social science, mathematics,\rscience, and technology. Teacher discussion groups and Book Clubs exist at school sites that provide teachers the opportunity to collaboratively share\rprofessional materials of mutual interest.
