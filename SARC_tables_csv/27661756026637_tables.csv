The San Ardo School District had not\r\rredesignated students as Reclassified Fluent English Proficient (RFEP) for a period of seven years\rup until the 2014-15 academic year.  This has presented a difficulty in determining the accuracy of\rthe current population of English Language Learners.  In 2014-15, (2) students were Redesignated\rFluent English Proficient (RFEP) and in 2015-16 (1) student was RFEP, in 2016-17 (21) students were\rRFEP, in 2017-18 (8) students were RFEP, and in 2018-19 (4) students were RFEP.   San Ardo is not\ra migrant farming area, as most families that move to the town tend to stay permanently.  There\rare no health or community services in the area.

It was determined that the school was lacking\rEnglish Language Arts and Mathematics curricular materials aligned with the Common Core State Standards.  Subsequently, students were not\rperforming well on California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress.  The District has since adopted new programs aligned with the Common\rCore State Standards.  Teachers participated in training for the new English Language Arts curriculum with a larger District at the beginning of 2016-17.\rProfessional development has also included training from Project Lead the Way for implementation of the science materials.  Teachers have traveled to\rUniversities such in San Jose, Chico, North Carolina, and Missouri to attend three to five day intensive training in 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2019-20.  The\r2017-18 academic year included professional development from the Monterey County Office of Education on Navigating the Smarter Balanced\rAssessment Consortium (SBAC), the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), and setting SMART goals to increase student\rachievement.  In October of 2017, we also began professional development in Guided Language Acquisition and Design (GLAD) strategies.  This\rprofessional development continued with in-class coaching and modeling through January and February 2018.  The District began the 2018-19 school\ryear with professional development on Step-up to Writing and school safety training.  The professional development continue through-out 2018-19 with\radditional days in January.  Teachers also conducted a review of the new social studies and history materials to implement a new program.  Several\rteachers and the administrator also attended a workshop in 2018-19 on performance-based assessment, balanced assessment systems, CAASPP\rperformance task deconstruction, and creating performance tasks. The 2019-20 academic year began with professional development with the Monterey\rCounty Office of Education reviewing deepening math practices.  The professional development has continued with support providers from MCOE\robserving and supporting teachers in classrooms in mathematics and science.  Teachers also evaluate Next Generation Science Standards newly approved\rcurricula and made a recommendation for an adoption for 2020-21. The administrator attends all of the professional development and facilitates teacher-\rprincipal meetings to address issues with ongoing implementation.\r\rTeachers are paid for two additional days of professional development at the beginning of the school year.  The current administration has supported\rmany days beyond the two provided and will continue to support them.\rNew faculty members may also participate in the Teacher Induction program, in which a facilitator works with beginning and veteran teachers in\rimproving their skills and addressing the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.  ...

Subsequently, students were not\rperforming well on California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress.  The District has since adopted new programs aligned with the Common\rCore State Standards.  Teachers participated in training for the new English Language Arts curriculum with a larger District at the beginning of 2016-17.\rProfessional development has also included training from Project Lead the Way for implementation of the science materials.  Teachers have traveled to\rUniversities such in San Jose, Chico, North Carolina, and Missouri to attend three to five day intensive training in 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2019-20.  The\r2017-18 academic year included professional development from the Monterey County Office of Education on Navigating the Smarter Balanced\rAssessment Consortium (SBAC), the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), and setting SMART goals to increase student\rachievement.  In October of 2017, we also began professional development in Guided Language Acquisition and Design (GLAD) strategies.  This\rprofessional development continued with in-class coaching and modeling through January and February 2018.  The District began the 2018-19 school\ryear with professional development on Step-up to Writing and school safety training.  The professional development continue through-out 2018-19 with\radditional days in January.  Teachers also conducted a review of the new social studies and history materials to implement a new program.  Several\rteachers and the administrator also attended a workshop in 2018-19 on performance-based assessment, balanced assessment systems, CAASPP\rperformance task deconstruction, and creating performance tasks. The 2019-20 academic year began with professional development with the Monterey\rCounty Office of Education reviewing deepening math practices.  The professional development has continued with support providers from MCOE\robserving and supporting teachers in classrooms in mathematics and science.  Teachers also evaluate Next Generation Science Standards newly approved\rcurricula and made a recommendation for an adoption for 2020-21. The administrator attends all of the professional development and facilitates teacher-\rprincipal meetings to address issues with ongoing implementation.\r\rTeachers are paid for two additional days of professional development at the beginning of the school year.  The current administration has supported\rmany days beyond the two provided and will continue to support them.\rNew faculty members may also participate in the Teacher Induction program, in which a facilitator works with beginning and veteran teachers in\rimproving their skills and addressing the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.  ...
