In addition to providing a\rBoard Memberrigorous academic setting, our teachers also concentrate their efforts to ensure that our students\r\rare good communicators, are great thinkers, and are respectful of others.\rDistrict Administration\r\rDr. Hasmik Danielian\rAll staff members are involved in creating a nurturing and challenging learning climate at Dulles\rSuperintendent\rElementary.\rDr. Patricio Vargas\r\rAssistant Superintendent -\rOur classrooms are print-rich environments that create a warm and welcoming place that supports\rEducational Services\rstudent success.\rEstuardo Santillan\r\rAssistant Superintendent, Business\rOur school has established clear performance standards aligned with state content standards and\rServices\rsets high-level expectations for all students.\rJohn Lopez\r\rAssistant Superintendent, Human\rThese efforts are supported by instructional leadership from our site and district, as well as training\rResources\rin research-based instructional strategies.\r\rAt Dulles Elementary School, our students’ individual needs are given the highest priority.\r\rDuring math, our teachers challenge the students to critically think about the processes of each\rconcept, using Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), a research-based instructional math program.\rWith CGI, students not only learn how to solve mathematical problems, they are expected to\rexplain their reasoning as they completed the work. As a teacher sees that a group of students are\rstruggling with a concept, they will pull that group together for a small group lesson to reinforce\rthe concept and address specific issues that the students are experiencing.

In addition to providing a\rBoard Memberrigorous academic setting, our teachers also concentrate their efforts to ensure that our students\r\rare good communicators, are great thinkers, and are respectful of others.\rDistrict Administration\r\rDr. Hasmik Danielian\rAll staff members are involved in creating a nurturing and challenging learning climate at Dulles\rSuperintendent\rElementary.\rDr. Patricio Vargas\r\rAssistant Superintendent -\rOur classrooms are print-rich environments that create a warm and welcoming place that supports\rEducational Services\rstudent success.\rEstuardo Santillan\r\rAssistant Superintendent, Business\rOur school has established clear performance standards aligned with state content standards and\rServices\rsets high-level expectations for all students.\rJohn Lopez\r\rAssistant Superintendent, Human\rThese efforts are supported by instructional leadership from our site and district, as well as training\rResources\rin research-based instructional strategies.\r\rAt Dulles Elementary School, our students’ individual needs are given the highest priority.\r\rDuring math, our teachers challenge the students to critically think about the processes of each\rconcept, using Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), a research-based instructional math program.\rWith CGI, students not only learn how to solve mathematical problems, they are expected to\rexplain their reasoning as they completed the work. As a teacher sees that a group of students are\rstruggling with a concept, they will pull that group together for a small group lesson to reinforce\rthe concept and address specific issues that the students are experiencing.
