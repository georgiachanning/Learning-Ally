Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) is a good example of this district supported PD.\rCGI follows a constructivist model of math instruction.  It allows students to construct meaning as they work through complex, real life word problems.\rTeachers who use this instructional strategy need to be trained in the nuances of lesson planning (to effectively build upon prior knowledge), finding the\rbalance between allowing students to struggle and providing instruction/guidance/feedback, and providing the necessary tools required for students to\rcommunicate their understanding in a variety of ways.  Along with CGI training, district PD opportunities are provided to staff via the Frontline Education\rwebsite.  Staff can view all upcoming trainings and register for any that pertain to their grade level or span.  In addition to this, the district supports our\rnewly hired teachers by providing the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program.  This program places each qualifying teacher with a\rsupport provider/mentor who regularly checks in with the teacher and provides supports necessary for the teacher's professional development.\r\rAt the site level, we have two days as administrators that we use exclusively for PD.  In the 2019-20 calendar year, Rancho Verde held PD on August 5th\rand December 19th.  On the 19th, teachers participated in a PD session on bullying.  In addition to these full days, we also have five annual Staff Meetings\rand 22 Student Early Release Days (SERD).  Our  SERDs are used by grade levels to review student work, analyze data and increase effective instruction\rthrough dialogue.  There are some days where grade levels or spans of grade levels participate in PD opportunities with administration or outside\rresources (ex. Active Shooter drill/Guided Reading/Para expectations/PBIS).  Our Staff Meetings also allow us to hold group PD sessions.  The site level\ralso offers "between the bells" PD via our instructional coach.  Our instructional coach works individually with teachers who request support.  The teacher\rand coach work together to identify areas of need, create an achievable goal, decide how the goal will be measured and then plan out observations and\rother supports the teacher may need in order to meet the goal.\r\rLast year (2018/19) and this year (2019/20), Rancho Verde's primary focus has been math instruction.  A majority of our students are not meeting grade\rlevel standards, as measured by the SBAC state assessment. Online curriculum (iReady Math) was purchased by the district.  We have held several PDs\rregarding usage of this program and continue to familiarize ourselves with the tools the program offers.  Our instructional coach has introduced Number\rCollections to our teachers and it is beginning to be used consistently.  CGI training continues to be completed by all teachers. Two types of interim\rassessments are used for growth monitoring purposes: interim comprehensive assessments (ICAs) and interim assessment blocks (IABs). ICAs mirror the\rsummative assessment in scope and format, while IABs focus on smaller sets of related concepts and provide more detailed information for instructional\rpurposes.  Utilizing these components last year, we saw an 8% growth in math performance, based on state assessments.  ... Unnamed: 11

Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) is a good example of this district supported PD.\rCGI follows a constructivist model of math instruction.  It allows students to construct meaning as they work through complex, real life word problems.\rTeachers who use this instructional strategy need to be trained in the nuances of lesson planning (to effectively build upon prior knowledge), finding the\rbalance between allowing students to struggle and providing instruction/guidance/feedback, and providing the necessary tools required for students to\rcommunicate their understanding in a variety of ways.  Along with CGI training, district PD opportunities are provided to staff via the Frontline Education\rwebsite.  Staff can view all upcoming trainings and register for any that pertain to their grade level or span.  In addition to this, the district supports our\rnewly hired teachers by providing the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program.  This program places each qualifying teacher with a\rsupport provider/mentor who regularly checks in with the teacher and provides supports necessary for the teacher's professional development.\r\rAt the site level, we have two days as administrators that we use exclusively for PD.  In the 2019-20 calendar year, Rancho Verde held PD on August 5th\rand December 19th.  On the 19th, teachers participated in a PD session on bullying.  In addition to these full days, we also have five annual Staff Meetings\rand 22 Student Early Release Days (SERD).  Our  SERDs are used by grade levels to review student work, analyze data and increase effective instruction\rthrough dialogue.  There are some days where grade levels or spans of grade levels participate in PD opportunities with administration or outside\rresources (ex. Active Shooter drill/Guided Reading/Para expectations/PBIS).  Our Staff Meetings also allow us to hold group PD sessions.  The site level\ralso offers "between the bells" PD via our instructional coach.  Our instructional coach works individually with teachers who request support.  The teacher\rand coach work together to identify areas of need, create an achievable goal, decide how the goal will be measured and then plan out observations and\rother supports the teacher may need in order to meet the goal.\r\rLast year (2018/19) and this year (2019/20), Rancho Verde's primary focus has been math instruction.  A majority of our students are not meeting grade\rlevel standards, as measured by the SBAC state assessment. Online curriculum (iReady Math) was purchased by the district.  We have held several PDs\rregarding usage of this program and continue to familiarize ourselves with the tools the program offers.  Our instructional coach has introduced Number\rCollections to our teachers and it is beginning to be used consistently.  CGI training continues to be completed by all teachers. Two types of interim\rassessments are used for growth monitoring purposes: interim comprehensive assessments (ICAs) and interim assessment blocks (IABs). ICAs mirror the\rsummative assessment in scope and format, while IABs focus on smaller sets of related concepts and provide more detailed information for instructional\rpurposes.  Utilizing these components last year, we saw an 8% growth in math performance, based on state assessments.  ... Unnamed: 6
