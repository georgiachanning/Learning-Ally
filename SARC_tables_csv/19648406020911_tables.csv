Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.  TK-2nd grade  teachers will also\rreceive training on Counting Collections, and Choral Counting within a cross-school collaborative Lab Day structure.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.  TK-2nd grade  teachers will also\rreceive training on Counting Collections, and Choral Counting within a cross-school collaborative Lab Day structure.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.  TK-2nd grade  teachers will also\rreceive training on Counting Collections, and Choral Counting within a cross-school collaborative Lab Day structure.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.  TK-2nd grade  teachers will also\rreceive training on Counting Collections, and Choral Counting within a cross-school collaborative Lab Day structure.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.  Grade level teachers will experience professional learning "Lab days" and visit a CGI school.  TK-2nd grade  teachers will also\rreceive training on Counting Collections, and Choral Counting within a cross-school collaborative Lab Day structure.

Our\rschool focused on learning our new math series called "Math Expressions" Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, and Professional Learning Communities.  In\r2018-19, Lampton began its focus on Math Problem Solving.   We held 2 days of professional development on the basic components of Cognitively Guided\rInstruction (CGI) in math.  Professional development for teachers was conducted two times per month, during after school workshops. During the school\ryear, we continued this focus by developing problem-solving rubrics and calibrating scoring of student work.\r\rThe focus for 2019-20, will expand our work in CGI with 2 additional days of summer training focusing on problem types, and linking math routines to\rproblems as a scaffold.
