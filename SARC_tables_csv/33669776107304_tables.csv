In addition, many staff members participate in additional trainings\rappropriate for individual needs or for specific programs sponsored by the district through departments.  Site professional development is held during\rearly release and grade level/subject collaboration days.  These collaborations focus on the cycle of inquiry and plan for first, best instruction after a\rreview of standards and students results on formative and summative assessments.  District professional development includes release days and after\rschool workshops.  When appropriate to meet the needs of students, staff attends conferences.  District instructional coaches and site academic coaches\rsupport certificated and paraprofessional staff by providing workshop opportunities, individual mentoring, and in-class coaching.  New teachers are\rsupported by the Teacher Induction Program that includes coaching and mentoring in addition to support from experienced grade level teacher leaders.\rClassified paraprofessionals and support staff attend job-related training provided by the site and district.\r\rDuring 2017-18,  Promenade Elementary School’s professional development focused on building teacher capacity: access and equity, claims and targets,\rand data analysis. Professional development supported our school goals, classroom goals, and individual goals. Teachers analyzed data across various\rgroups of students while developing functional understanding of ELD standards and practices.  Teachers also received professional development on the\rEnglish Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC), including its task types and identified the connectedness to Common Core Language\rArts Standards.\r\rIn the 2018-19 school year the focus of professional development continued in order to further close the achievement gap.  Part of Professional\rDevelopment focused on English learners, specifically teachers and staff looked at SBAC Interim Assessments in order to gain a deeper understanding of\rthe rigor and academic language within theses assessments.  Additionally, teachers developed a deeper understanding of the ELPAC and Smarter\rBalanced tools in order to apply the understanding to instructional planning and pacing to better meet the needs of ELs.  All SBAC tools are used to\renhance instruction and support all student groups.\r\rAlvord Unified School District provides professional development for teachers and support staff on various topics related to state mandated assessments\r(SBAC,ELPAC),specialeducationassessments,interimassessments,formativeassessments(PELI,DIBELS),studentdata,Aeries/CALPADSdata\rmanagement for specific school staff, instructional strategies for English learners, intervention strategies, behavior supports, mandated special education\rforms/plans,  crisis response, student success teams, and Aeries gradebook.\r\rThe annual number of school days dedicated to staff development and/or collaboration attended by either all staff, grade level teams, or subject level\rteachers:\r2017-18:  3\r2018-19:  2\r2019-20:  5  ...
