Our high\rquality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies.\rWe hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project.\r\rIn addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach-led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting.\rThese cohorts are both semester-long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for\rInnovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously and teachers are able to select professional development\rthat best meets their needs.\r\rWe ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project. Our summer intensive training, along with on-going\rstaff development days and release days, align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework for Excellence.\r\rthe leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content knowledge,\rstrengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every staff member\rhelps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rDistrictState Average for\rCategory\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,107$48,612\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,310$74,676\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,311$99,791\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$129,880$125,830\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$138,066$131,167\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$149,818$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$318,954$275,796\r\rDistrictState Average for\rPercent of District Budget\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rTeacher Salaries37%34%\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries & Benefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Our high\rquality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies.\rWe hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project.\r\rIn addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach-led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting.\rThese cohorts are both semester-long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for\rInnovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously and teachers are able to select professional development\rthat best meets their needs.\r\rWe ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project. Our summer intensive training, along with on-going\rstaff development days and release days, align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework for Excellence.\r\rthe leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content knowledge,\rstrengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every staff member\rhelps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rDistrictState Average for\rCategory\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,107$48,612\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,310$74,676\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,311$99,791\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$129,880$125,830\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$138,066$131,167\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$149,818$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$318,954$275,796\r\rDistrictState Average for\rPercent of District Budget\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rTeacher Salaries37%34%\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries & Benefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Our high\rquality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies.\rWe hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project.\r\rIn addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach-led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting.\rThese cohorts are both semester-long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for\rInnovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously and teachers are able to select professional development\rthat best meets their needs.\r\rWe ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project. Our summer intensive training, along with on-going\rstaff development days and release days, align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework for Excellence.\r\rthe leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content knowledge,\rstrengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every staff member\rhelps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rDistrictState Average for\rCategory\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,107$48,612\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,310$74,676\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,311$99,791\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$129,880$125,830\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$138,066$131,167\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$149,818$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$318,954$275,796\r\rDistrictState Average for\rPercent of District Budget\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rTeacher Salaries37%34%\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries & Benefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

Our high\rquality professional development program is focused on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as well as balanced literacy and instructional strategies.\rWe hold affiliation status with Columbia University Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project.\r\rIn addition, every SRVUSD teacher is provided an opportunity to participate in a coach-led cohort to study instructional strategies in a small group setting.\rThese cohorts are both semester-long and yearlong and are focused on topics that run the gamut from Interactive Lecture to Reading Workshop for\rInnovators to Problem Solving Strategies. There are dozens of cohorts running simultaneously and teachers are able to select professional development\rthat best meets their needs.\r\rWe ensure that new teachers are provided support through the SRVUSD Teacher Induction Project. Our summer intensive training, along with on-going\rstaff development days and release days, align with the needs of our individual schools and our Framework for Excellence.\r\rthe leadership and guidance of site administrators, such communities of practices afford our staff the opportunity to deepen their content knowledge,\rstrengthen their instructional repertoire, improve their assessment strategies, and foster a shared sense of responsibility. As a result, every staff member\rhelps to promote and nurture a community of learners in which the individual is enriched and the district as a whole is enhanced.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rDistrictState Average for\rCategory\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,107$48,612\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,310$74,676\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,311$99,791\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$129,880$125,830\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$138,066$131,167\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$149,818$144,822\rSuperintendent Salary$318,954$275,796\r\rDistrictState Average for\rPercent of District Budget\rAmountDistricts In Same Category\rTeacher Salaries37%34%\rAdministrative Salaries5%5%\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries & Benefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.
