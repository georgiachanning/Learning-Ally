Teachers participate in advanced training designed to promote specific skills and provide information related to school priorities and objectives.\rOur goal is to provide an academic environment of rigorous daily instruction for our students. Professional development occurs in staff meetings and\rduring site PLC's that occur twice a week.  During PLCs, staff use data to determine the best use of researched-based practices, inquiry, interactive writing,\rdifferentiated instruction, guided reading, strategies for EL students, and intensive intervention from the support of a resource teacher.\r\rThe Biola-Pershing Professional Development Plans for  2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20 include the following specific training topics:\r\rAccelerated Reader Program training\rDiscovery Education\rEnglish Learner Professional Development training\rSocial-Emotional Training\rFountas & Pinnell Training and miscue analysis\rSocial Media Training\rRun, Hide, and Fight Training\rSchool Safety Training\rTrauma-Informed Classroom Practices\r\rOur PLC and Professional Development plan coordinates with Common Core State Standards, Performance Tasks, PBIS, and technology use in class.\rTeachers are supported by two District Academic Coaches, who reinforce and assist teachers with implementing best instructional practices as well as\rsupport from the administrator.  ...
