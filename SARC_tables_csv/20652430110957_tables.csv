We take advantage of our early\rrelease staff development days to meet in Professional Learning Communities for data collection/reflection and to plan for instruction. In addition to\rthese days, there are times when the staff meets after school to do further trainings.\r\rMuch of our focus this next year will be on improving our teachers’ skills through the professional learning community to provide intervention strategies,\rdirect instruction  techniques and English learner strategies. Through the use of our Teachers on Special Assignment (TSA), we have also provided our\rown staff professional development in Kagan Structures, academic vocabulary strategies and other reading strategies for first through sixth grade\rteachers. This year, all students will receive differentiated reading instruction at their grade level through a school-wide deployment called WIN (What I\rNeed) Time. Our Primary Literacy Support Specialists provide coaching support in the primary grades to improve teachers’ instructional skills and provide\rtraining for guided reading instruction and ongoing informal assessments. Our site coach provides coaching cycles which include modeling, co-planning,\rco-teaching, observing, supporting, and reflecting for all grade levels based on needs of staff. Teacher teams are led in the development of rigorous,\rcommon core aligned units of instruction. Students are thus engaged in integrated curricular learning experiences throughout the day.\r\rThe majority of our staff has been trained in conducting Professional Learning Community meetings. These collaborative meetings are focused on current\rstudent data collected by our common formative assessments. Teachers meet in PLCs during our minimum days(Thursdays) and every other Tuesday.\rTeachers at each grade level share out best practices based on the results of their assessments.\r\rAdministration continues to participate in daily Focus Walks throughout our campus. Notes are taken based on observations made during the classroom\rvisits. Teachers are provided with immediate written and oral feedback in regards to rigorous instructional techniques.\r\rTopics for staff development include: Professional Learning Communities, Guided and Close Reading, Informal Running Records, Khan Academy, Path to\rProficiency (for ELs), Write From the Beginning, Thinking Maps,  Response to Intervention, NGSS Science Lessons, Reading, Scholastic Reading Assessment\r(NSGRA), Wonders and Benchmark Training.  ...

We take advantage of our early\rrelease staff development days to meet in Professional Learning Communities for data collection/reflection and to plan for instruction. In addition to\rthese days, there are times when the staff meets after school to do further trainings.\r\rMuch of our focus this next year will be on improving our teachers’ skills through the professional learning community to provide intervention strategies,\rdirect instruction  techniques and English learner strategies. Through the use of our Teachers on Special Assignment (TSA), we have also provided our\rown staff professional development in Kagan Structures, academic vocabulary strategies and other reading strategies for first through sixth grade\rteachers. This year, all students will receive differentiated reading instruction at their grade level through a school-wide deployment called WIN (What I\rNeed) Time. Our Primary Literacy Support Specialists provide coaching support in the primary grades to improve teachers’ instructional skills and provide\rtraining for guided reading instruction and ongoing informal assessments. Our site coach provides coaching cycles which include modeling, co-planning,\rco-teaching, observing, supporting, and reflecting for all grade levels based on needs of staff. Teacher teams are led in the development of rigorous,\rcommon core aligned units of instruction. Students are thus engaged in integrated curricular learning experiences throughout the day.\r\rThe majority of our staff has been trained in conducting Professional Learning Community meetings. These collaborative meetings are focused on current\rstudent data collected by our common formative assessments. Teachers meet in PLCs during our minimum days(Thursdays) and every other Tuesday.\rTeachers at each grade level share out best practices based on the results of their assessments.\r\rAdministration continues to participate in daily Focus Walks throughout our campus. Notes are taken based on observations made during the classroom\rvisits. Teachers are provided with immediate written and oral feedback in regards to rigorous instructional techniques.\r\rTopics for staff development include: Professional Learning Communities, Guided and Close Reading, Informal Running Records, Khan Academy, Path to\rProficiency (for ELs), Write From the Beginning, Thinking Maps,  Response to Intervention, NGSS Science Lessons, Reading, Scholastic Reading Assessment\r(NSGRA), Wonders and Benchmark Training.  ...
