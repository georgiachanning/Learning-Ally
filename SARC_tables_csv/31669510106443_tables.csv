On a weekly basis, teachers participate in grade\rlevel Professional Learning Communities (PLC) as a school site.  In addition, Western Placer Unified School District generally provides three Staff\rDevelopment Days each year to all teachers who want to take the time to collaborate with site and/or cross-site PLC teams to continue curriculum\rdevelopment.   We have an established an Leadership team comprised of the school principal, psychologist, and teacher representation from all grade-\rlevels for shared decision making on our academic direction as a site.  Two of our grade levels are receiving ongoing training with a consultant to align\rour current curriculum with the California Math Framework.  Our PBIS Team has also completed our Tier III training with county coaches and meets\rmonthly on site to look at behavior data and address areas of concern as well as ways to continue promoting an overall positive school climate.

On a weekly basis, teachers participate in grade\rlevel Professional Learning Communities (PLC) as a school site.  In addition, Western Placer Unified School District generally provides three Staff\rDevelopment Days each year to all teachers who want to take the time to collaborate with site and/or cross-site PLC teams to continue curriculum\rdevelopment.   We have an established an Leadership team comprised of the school principal, psychologist, and teacher representation from all grade-\rlevels for shared decision making on our academic direction as a site.  Two of our grade levels are receiving ongoing training with a consultant to align\rour current curriculum with the California Math Framework.  Our PBIS Team has also completed our Tier III training with county coaches and meets\rmonthly on site to look at behavior data and address areas of concern as well as ways to continue promoting an overall positive school climate.
