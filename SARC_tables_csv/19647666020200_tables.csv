Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.  Along with Lexia, we are using their Reading Plus program in grades three through six.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$7,610$1,715$5,894$87,529\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-30.72.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-24.112.0\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.

All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.  Along with Lexia, we are using their Reading Plus program in grades three through six.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$7,610$1,715$5,894$87,529\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-30.72.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-24.112.0\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.

All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.  Along with Lexia, we are using their Reading Plus program in grades three through six.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$7,610$1,715$5,894$87,529\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-30.72.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-24.112.0\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.  All teachers have been trained in Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI) through\rDataWorks and Project Based Learning (PBL).\r\rOlita is implementing the ST Math program for students in kindergarten through fifth grade.  We have also adopted a web-based reading program called\rLexia.  Along with Lexia, we are using their Reading Plus program in grades three through six.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,074$49,378School Site-$7,610$1,715$5,894$87,529\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$85,000$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8,034$85,119.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,384$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$110,612$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$122,930$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$199,500$189,346\rSchool Site/District-30.72.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-24.112.0\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries41%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

Teacher training priorities are identified each year,\rand teachers and administrators participate in District and school-level inservice programs. All elementary schools are provided one shortened day per\rweek for site-based inservices related to specific school goals. All schools participate in annual August inservices, after-school inservices, and various\rconferences throughout the year.   All teachers have been GLAD trained and Thinking Map trained and are using strategies in their classrooms throughout\rthe year. In 2017, our district adopted English Language Arts curriculum. For grades Kindergarten through fifth, we adopted Journeys from Houghton\rMifflin.  In sixth grade, we adopted Study Sync by McGraw Hill. In 2014 Houghton Mifflin Go Math! was adopted along with Big Ideas for 6th grade.\rTextbooks and supplements are being used, along with the pacing guides designed by the publisher and Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and\rInstruction.  Presently,  our teachers are being trained in Thinking Maps.
