The District has three effective\reducational practices (EIP’s) that serve as the focus for all professional learning opportunities: Depth of Knowledge; Student Engagement; Checking for\rUnderstanding. Annually, staff are surveyed to determine needs and interests, data is reviewed and feedback is obtained in order to determine areas for\rongoing professional development.  Professional development is a part of every site plan and a major component of instructional support to departments.\rThe District's professional development program provides opportunities for teachers to implement the district's adopted and supplemental curriculum\rfor all students, implement State standards, update subject area expertise, use data to plan instructional improvement strategies and acquire new\rinstructional strategies. Professional development and ongoing support is delivered in numerous ways: District sponsored days, in class coaching, after\rschool workshops, conference/workshop attendance, early release days, summer sessions, and sub release time.\r\rIn addition to optional professional development sessions, the following opportunities were provided:\r\rEarly Release Professional Development Day(s):\r2013-14:  9\r2014-15:  22\r2015-16:  27\r2016-17:  28\r2017-18   34\r2018-19:  34\r2019-20:  35\r\rDistrict Professional Development Day(s):\r2013-14:  1\r2014-15:  2\r2015-16:  0\r2016-17:  1\r2017-18:  1\r2018-19:  1\r2019-20:  1  ...
