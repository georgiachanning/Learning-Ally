In addition, all\rteachers participate in monthly professional development activities organized during regularly scheduled staff meetings.  Staff also participate in\rprofessional development workshops organized by Oceanside Unified School District and/or the San Diego County Office of Education.\r\rTeachers and staff attend these professional development workshops to improve their teaching skills and to extend their knowledge of grade appropriate\rsubject matter.   The primary focus for professional development is on understanding how to implement the Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  This\rincludes working on developing a Balanced Literacy Program, small group Guided Reading and related assessments, Benchmark Advance English\rLanguage Arts curriculum, the Lucy Caulkins Writing program and our Go-Math program.\r\rIn addition, we provide professional development on effective uses of technology, including the use of i-Pads and our 140 Chrome Books for instruction.\rAll staff are working to obtain their certification in Digital Citizenship. We currently have 1:1 Chrome Books in 5th grade and soon will have them in all\rgrade levels. Lastly, we are addressing the 4Cs of the 21st Century Skills which include Creativity, Critical Thinking, Collaboration and Communication.\r\rAll teachers are provided planning time twice a month to work with their grade level teams to discuss student results and data, curriculum and instruction\rand next steps to ensure all students are learning.  The principal supports teachers with reflections from classroom observations regarding their\rinstruction and Common Core implementation.  ... Unnamed: 6
