Participating new teachers are provided with support from the district, the Santa Barbara County Office of Education, and\rmonthly seminars. All teachers participate in two full professional development days, one on site and one held in the Santa Inez Valley for "Valley-wide\rProfessional Development." Throughout the year teachers meet and collaborate in Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) on early release Mondays.\rIn addition, teachers attend workshops on various topics related to the implementation plan for LCAP and the Common Core Standards as well as meet\rwith grade level colleagues within the valley. The district Technology Committee continues to drive the district's use of best practices in technology\rintegration in the classroom.\r\rThe implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) will be developed at each school site.\rThe district continues to join with other valley school districts to provide a comprehensive year-long professional development program with consultation\rfrom the County Office for all teachers in instructional strategies for the implementation of the Common Core Standards in English Language Arts and\rMath and technology. In Oct., 2019, all teachers in the Buellton Union School District attended a full-day professional developing on students' mental\rhealth and social & emotional development and well-being.\r\rStaff development is based on the needs of the students and the changing demands of instruction. In the 2016-2017 school year, the focus was\rmathematics training to support English Learners and facilitating the transition to the Common Core State Standards using the new adoption of College\rPreparatory Math (CPM). Teachers attended trainings to support our Gold Ribbon Award winning math intervention program. Our annual staff\rdevelopment day(s) and All-Valley Collaboration Days provided teachers with additional support in mathematics  and literacy teaching strategies and\rmethodologies with regard to the Common Core State Standards. Additionally, teachers have attended workshops on NGSS and technology in the\rclassroom.\r\rAll core subject teachers teachers meet in PLC groups  for one day in the fall and one full day in the spring to plan and make pacing plans aligned with\rCommon Core State Standards as well as to look at data to plan further instruction.  Math teachers also attend the CPM conference for 2 days to learn\rabout math RtI and various math strategies. Math teachers also used 1.5 PD days during the summer of 2016 to learn about Dreambox, Number Talks,\rand other components for the math Success intervention classes.  ELA teachers attended a Reading Plus PD in the Spring of 2016.\r\rTeachers who require help with improving skills are given as much support as needed to ensure their continued professional development.  ...

Participating new teachers are provided with support from the district, the Santa Barbara County Office of Education, and\rmonthly seminars. All teachers participate in two full professional development days, one on site and one held in the Santa Inez Valley for "Valley-wide\rProfessional Development." Throughout the year teachers meet and collaborate in Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) on early release Mondays.\rIn addition, teachers attend workshops on various topics related to the implementation plan for LCAP and the Common Core Standards as well as meet\rwith grade level colleagues within the valley. The district Technology Committee continues to drive the district's use of best practices in technology\rintegration in the classroom.\r\rThe implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) will be developed at each school site.\rThe district continues to join with other valley school districts to provide a comprehensive year-long professional development program with consultation\rfrom the County Office for all teachers in instructional strategies for the implementation of the Common Core Standards in English Language Arts and\rMath and technology. In Oct., 2019, all teachers in the Buellton Union School District attended a full-day professional developing on students' mental\rhealth and social & emotional development and well-being.\r\rStaff development is based on the needs of the students and the changing demands of instruction. In the 2016-2017 school year, the focus was\rmathematics training to support English Learners and facilitating the transition to the Common Core State Standards using the new adoption of College\rPreparatory Math (CPM). Teachers attended trainings to support our Gold Ribbon Award winning math intervention program. Our annual staff\rdevelopment day(s) and All-Valley Collaboration Days provided teachers with additional support in mathematics  and literacy teaching strategies and\rmethodologies with regard to the Common Core State Standards. Additionally, teachers have attended workshops on NGSS and technology in the\rclassroom.\r\rAll core subject teachers teachers meet in PLC groups  for one day in the fall and one full day in the spring to plan and make pacing plans aligned with\rCommon Core State Standards as well as to look at data to plan further instruction.  Math teachers also attend the CPM conference for 2 days to learn\rabout math RtI and various math strategies. Math teachers also used 1.5 PD days during the summer of 2016 to learn about Dreambox, Number Talks,\rand other components for the math Success intervention classes.  ELA teachers attended a Reading Plus PD in the Spring of 2016.\r\rTeachers who require help with improving skills are given as much support as needed to ensure their continued professional development.  ...
