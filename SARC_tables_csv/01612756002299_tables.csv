Prior to the\r2016-17 school year, the District offered three staff development days annually where teachers were provided with a range of PD offerings on topics\rsuch as Common Core Standards training, differentiation, instructional technology, new math curriculum, and vertical alignment of standards instruction.\r\rBeginning the 2016-17 school year, PUSD instituted a flexible professional development program, which allows all certificated staff to select the\rprofessional learning topic and structure that best fit their learning needs.  Some examples of professional development selected by tri-school elementary\rteachers are as follows: differentiated math instruction, teaching reading in small groups, integrated learning, and social emotional learning.\r\rIn 2018-19 we used a new model where the district, site, and teachers determined the content of each of the three days. The district selected training\ron the social justice standards, the site selected training on professional learning communities, and teachers chose a range of topics that are relevant to\rtheir teaching. Some topics include integrated learning, phonics, word study, mathematical problem solving and Professional Learning Communities. In\raddition to providing professional learning opportunities on the professional development days, teacher have ongoing professional development\ropportunities at monthly staff meeting and on an as needed/as requested basis.\r\rNew teachers participate in a full day professional development orientation are assigned a mentor as part of the Teacher Induction Program (TIP) or may\rparticipate with Teachers Engaged in Active Mentoring (TEAM).
