The district performed\rQuick Strike projects during the summer of 2014, which allowed schools to pick from one of the following improvements: 1) marquees, 2) closed-circuit\rtelevision (CCTV) surveillance, 3) exterior painting, or 4) seal coating and striping of parking lots or playgrounds.  Fire alarms at all the district schools\rwere upgraded.  Additional 10 million dollars have been allocated for safety and security upgrades, which are expected to begin in 2019.\r\rFunding from the federal government through Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) provided for technology infrastructure improvements\rto the district’s wireless connectivity.  The improvements, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2019, will increase classroom internet\raccess and digital voice communication.  ... Unnamed: 8
