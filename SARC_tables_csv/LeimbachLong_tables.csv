Our goal is to\rprovide students with an exciting learning experience that encompasses the rigor of instruction within a safe and supportive\rclimate. Students receive a standards-based curriculum with extra support for those with special needs. We have an\racademic intervention team that works with designated students who show promise of rapid improvement or need intensive\rsupport. Learning Center staff assists those who need to make gains in reaching grade level standards. We also offer an\rafter school "ROAR Academy" where over 200 students receive assistance with homework and enrichment opportunities in\rtechnology, fine arts, and physical education. Additional programs consist of AVID, CREST, Visual and Performing Arts, and\rStudent Council providing students with leadership and college and career opportunities.

We have an\racademic intervention team that works with designated students who show promise of rapid improvement or need intensive\rsupport. Learning Center staff assists those who need to make gains in reaching grade level standards. We also offer an\rafter school "ROAR Academy" where over 200 students receive assistance with homework and enrichment opportunities in\rtechnology, fine arts, and physical education. Additional programs consist of AVID, CREST, Visual and Performing Arts, and\rStudent Council providing students with leadership and college and career opportunities.

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rLast year, the district’s governing board approved deferred maintenance projects for this school that will resulted in the\rreplacement of the roof on the multipurpose room and the installation of a new fire alarm system for all classrooms, and new\rair conditioning units for designated buildings, including the multipurpose room. The work of this project concluded in\rSeptember 2019.  ... Unnamed: 2

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment.

The district utilizes the latest electronic work order system enabling site administration and custodians to\rcommunicate maintenance needs, urgent repairs, or necessary projects. Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved\rby either the school custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to\rdevelop a daily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff\rentering school grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and\rsanitary. The Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district. A summary of these standards\ris available at the school office, or at the district office.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rLast year, the district’s governing board approved deferred maintenance projects for this school that will resulted in the\rreplacement of the roof on the multipurpose room and the installation of a new fire alarm system for all classrooms, and new\rair conditioning units for designated buildings, including the multipurpose room.

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5
