Our academic RTI includes Tier 1 interventions implemented by classroom teachers, Tier 2 interventions implemented during grade level\rplatooning and Tier 3 interventions provided by our RTI specialist and RSP teacher during non core instruction.  Our behavioral RTI is also three tiered.\rTier 1 interventions are provided by classroom teachers using Second Step lessons. Tier 2 and 3 interventions are provided by staff including our\rcounselor, teachers, and support staff and include Check-In -Check-Out, behavior groups and one on one counseling.\r\rTeacher support and coaching is imperative for successful implementation.  Support structures in place include weekly built-in collaboration time.\rTeachers collaborate  within and across the grade levels to ensure that lessons are designed to teach grade level standards and meet the needs of all\rlearners. Professional Learning Communities include learning and sharing effective teaching strategies, evaluating student assessment data, reteaching\rlessons, pre-teaching lessons, and developing formative assessments to inform student achievement. Workshops and trainings have included targeted\rprofessional development on Eureka Math, ELA common core and ELD instructional strategies. Teachers also work with our RTI Specialist using a coaching\rmodel. This provides teachers the opportunity to develop effective lessons and observe best teaching practices within the grade level.\r\rAs part of our cycle of continuous improvement, we recognize that students may be experiencing an opportunity gap. Our current demographics include:\r29% English Language Learners. In addition to designated and integrated EL classroom instruction done by the classroom teacher, our EL Coach provides\rsmall group intensive interventions focused on English Language Development through an after school English Learner Academy for students. The EL\rCoach also provides teacher training and modeling of effective strategies for EL instruction.  ... Unnamed: 6

Our academic RTI includes Tier 1 interventions implemented by classroom teachers, Tier 2 interventions implemented during grade level\rplatooning and Tier 3 interventions provided by our RTI specialist and RSP teacher during non core instruction.  Our behavioral RTI is also three tiered.\rTier 1 interventions are provided by classroom teachers using Second Step lessons. Tier 2 and 3 interventions are provided by staff including our\rcounselor, teachers, and support staff and include Check-In -Check-Out, behavior groups and one on one counseling.\r\rTeacher support and coaching is imperative for successful implementation.  Support structures in place include weekly built-in collaboration time.\rTeachers collaborate  within and across the grade levels to ensure that lessons are designed to teach grade level standards and meet the needs of all\rlearners. Professional Learning Communities include learning and sharing effective teaching strategies, evaluating student assessment data, reteaching\rlessons, pre-teaching lessons, and developing formative assessments to inform student achievement. Workshops and trainings have included targeted\rprofessional development on Eureka Math, ELA common core and ELD instructional strategies. Teachers also work with our RTI Specialist using a coaching\rmodel. This provides teachers the opportunity to develop effective lessons and observe best teaching practices within the grade level.\r\rAs part of our cycle of continuous improvement, we recognize that students may be experiencing an opportunity gap. Our current demographics include:\r29% English Language Learners. In addition to designated and integrated EL classroom instruction done by the classroom teacher, our EL Coach provides\rsmall group intensive interventions focused on English Language Development through an after school English Learner Academy for students. The EL\rCoach also provides teacher training and modeling of effective strategies for EL instruction.  ... Unnamed: 11
