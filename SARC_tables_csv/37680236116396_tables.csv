Activities reflect the\rschool's goals and objectives and are part of our School Plan for Student Achievement.\r\rThis year at TMES, our learning focus is to work towards increasing academic achievement and develop social and emotional learning to inspire\rcollaborative conversations & corporative learning for students’ and staff. We are utilizing the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning\r(CASEL) model to guide our work. This is our second year as a Sanford Harmony Demonstration School. All of our teachers are using the Sanford Harmony\rcurriculum daily within the classroom and during our school-wide buddies. Also, we have partnered with I heart Chula Vista to have a Trauma Therapist\rWanda Brothers train our staff and community on Attachment, Anxiety, Mental Health, Stress, and Coping Strategies.\rWe believe that this shift will help yield positive results for our students to develop their ability to solve problems and communicate their thinking in all\rareas of life, including math. As a community, we are building all areas of the brain so we can inspire students to take ownership of their learning.\rSpecifically, we have three professional learning cycles. First quarter focused on the meetup. The second quarter was the buddy up. Third quarter we\rtapped into our students' ability to collaborated and talk with their peers ad they build their problem-solving skills. Teachers received training on the\rmath block, three reads protocol, and math data review. Within all three cycles, teachers had professional readings. Our site ILT team paved the way for\rteacher learning and creating an environment for staff to thrive.\r\rThe primary focus during the 2017/2018 was to develop the growth mindset of staff and students through goals and the success criteria. Professional\rdevelopment was held to support teachers. Students also received lessons on growth mindset. A professional development cycle was created to support\rthe implementation of success criteria in the area of problem-solving. Professional developments were held during the teacher contract hour. ILT\rmeetings attended cohort sessions to support building the capacity of the ILT members. During the cycle, teachers read professional readings, visited\rpeer classes and discuss student performance. In additional teachers received support from the principal and Resource teacher during admin designated\rcollaboration time. Furthermore, there was a site-wide interest and investment into Sanford Harmony Social Emotional curriculum. Teachers received\rprofessional development from National University Harmony training team on how to successfully implement Harmony within the classroom.  This was\ralso done with the use of visible learning strategies such as Metacognition Strategies, Learner Goals, Learning Intentions, Reflection and Evaluation.\rTraining last year included, but was not limited to: See..Think..Wonder, ELPAC, Data Review, Technology, Illuminate, NGSS, GATE, Metacognitive\rStrategies, Benchmark Education, Problem Solving in Math, Achieve 3000, Smarty Ants, Harmony, Safety training, Social and Emotional Learning, RTI,\rCash Handling, and more. In addition, TMES supports the CVESD them on impacting the human spirit through relationships.\r\rDuring the 2016-17 school-year, Thurgood Marshall’s main focus area for the is reading and writing. During the 2015-16 school-year, it was reading\rcomprehension. Professional development this year included: ELD, Imagine Learning, Team Building, Technology Programs, GATE, NGSS, Occupational\rTherapy, Speech-Language Pathology, Safety, Math, ELA, GLAD, Report Card, Close Reading, Development, Writing, Social-Emotional, Supporting the\rneeds of students. During the 2015-16 school year, professional development included Wilda Storm Close Reading and Vocabulary Development, Go\rMath, SIPPS, and Achieve3000.  In the 14-15 year, we received professional development on Lucy Calkins Units of Study, Socratic Seminar, vocabulary\rdevelopment and Achieve3000.  In the 2013-14 school year, we supported teachers with 8 Mathematical Practices training, Common Core State\rStandards and Achieve3000 professional development.  ... Unnamed: 6

Activities reflect the\rschool's goals and objectives and are part of our School Plan for Student Achievement.\r\rThis year at TMES, our learning focus is to work towards increasing academic achievement and develop social and emotional learning to inspire\rcollaborative conversations & corporative learning for students’ and staff. We are utilizing the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning\r(CASEL) model to guide our work. This is our second year as a Sanford Harmony Demonstration School. All of our teachers are using the Sanford Harmony\rcurriculum daily within the classroom and during our school-wide buddies. Also, we have partnered with I heart Chula Vista to have a Trauma Therapist\rWanda Brothers train our staff and community on Attachment, Anxiety, Mental Health, Stress, and Coping Strategies.\rWe believe that this shift will help yield positive results for our students to develop their ability to solve problems and communicate their thinking in all\rareas of life, including math. As a community, we are building all areas of the brain so we can inspire students to take ownership of their learning.\rSpecifically, we have three professional learning cycles. First quarter focused on the meetup. The second quarter was the buddy up. Third quarter we\rtapped into our students' ability to collaborated and talk with their peers ad they build their problem-solving skills. Teachers received training on the\rmath block, three reads protocol, and math data review. Within all three cycles, teachers had professional readings. Our site ILT team paved the way for\rteacher learning and creating an environment for staff to thrive.\r\rThe primary focus during the 2017/2018 was to develop the growth mindset of staff and students through goals and the success criteria. Professional\rdevelopment was held to support teachers. Students also received lessons on growth mindset. A professional development cycle was created to support\rthe implementation of success criteria in the area of problem-solving. Professional developments were held during the teacher contract hour. ILT\rmeetings attended cohort sessions to support building the capacity of the ILT members. During the cycle, teachers read professional readings, visited\rpeer classes and discuss student performance. In additional teachers received support from the principal and Resource teacher during admin designated\rcollaboration time. Furthermore, there was a site-wide interest and investment into Sanford Harmony Social Emotional curriculum. Teachers received\rprofessional development from National University Harmony training team on how to successfully implement Harmony within the classroom.  This was\ralso done with the use of visible learning strategies such as Metacognition Strategies, Learner Goals, Learning Intentions, Reflection and Evaluation.\rTraining last year included, but was not limited to: See..Think..Wonder, ELPAC, Data Review, Technology, Illuminate, NGSS, GATE, Metacognitive\rStrategies, Benchmark Education, Problem Solving in Math, Achieve 3000, Smarty Ants, Harmony, Safety training, Social and Emotional Learning, RTI,\rCash Handling, and more. In addition, TMES supports the CVESD them on impacting the human spirit through relationships.\r\rDuring the 2016-17 school-year, Thurgood Marshall’s main focus area for the is reading and writing. During the 2015-16 school-year, it was reading\rcomprehension. Professional development this year included: ELD, Imagine Learning, Team Building, Technology Programs, GATE, NGSS, Occupational\rTherapy, Speech-Language Pathology, Safety, Math, ELA, GLAD, Report Card, Close Reading, Development, Writing, Social-Emotional, Supporting the\rneeds of students. During the 2015-16 school year, professional development included Wilda Storm Close Reading and Vocabulary Development, Go\rMath, SIPPS, and Achieve3000.  In the 14-15 year, we received professional development on Lucy Calkins Units of Study, Socratic Seminar, vocabulary\rdevelopment and Achieve3000.  In the 2013-14 school year, we supported teachers with 8 Mathematical Practices training, Common Core State\rStandards and Achieve3000 professional development.  ... Unnamed: 11
