The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district wide professional development throughout the year. Areas of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for\rimplementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, curriculum training in writing, language arts (ARC and\rBenchmark) and mathematics (UCI Math Project), as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners.  The project includes hands-on,\rresearch-based professional development, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the\rimplementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math\reducation researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted\rin our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework.\rThe ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the\rneed for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have\rbeen delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and\rduring individual teacher planning days.This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade-level teams,\rand through individual mentoring by the school administrator. In addition, Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-\remotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the\rimplementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms\rin order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support\rfor year one and two teachers. Teachers who are experiencing difficultly or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.  ... Unnamed: 6

The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district wide professional development throughout the year. Areas of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for\rimplementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, curriculum training in writing, language arts (ARC and\rBenchmark) and mathematics (UCI Math Project), as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners.  The project includes hands-on,\rresearch-based professional development, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the\rimplementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math\reducation researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted\rin our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework.\rThe ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the\rneed for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have\rbeen delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and\rduring individual teacher planning days.This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade-level teams,\rand through individual mentoring by the school administrator. In addition, Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-\remotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the\rimplementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms\rin order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support\rfor year one and two teachers.
