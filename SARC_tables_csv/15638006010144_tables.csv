Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county.

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library).

Preservice days, early release Wednesdays and the NO Student Inservice Day for teachers will focus on this training.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$46,748$49,378School Site-$10,138$2,734$7,404$65,811\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$66,771$77,190D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,831$66,575.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,284$96,607-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$113,066$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$108,745$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$160,040$189,346\rSchool Site/District-5.64.8\r\rSchool Site/ State-33.2-12.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries30%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rThese programs and services are provided at the school either through categorical funds or other sources that support and assist students: We provide\rMigrant Services, Bilingual Aides, and Transitional and Kindergarten Paraprofessionals.\r\r\r\r\rDataQuest\rDataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/ that contains additional information about\rthis school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for\raccountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).\r\rInternet Access\rInternet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at\rlibraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis.
