This focus was to ensure that all\rteachers were well prepared fort he coming year as they embarked into full common core implementation. These training consisted of bi-monthly\rprofessional development sessions on minimum days in addition to full day grade level team planning days. Individual teachers received mentoring and\rcoaching by the Principal and district's common core coaches to support the implementation of new common core curriculum and strategies. These\rstrategies were also modeled by the coaches and principal to support implementation. To support teacher practice and implementation of these\rstrategies, in class coaching and grade level team planning was utilized. In addition, during professional development days, student data results from\riReady and other common formative assessment results were analyzed to determine next steps in professional development opportunities.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-12667.053608.929058.1289703.10\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District-1.31.6\r\rSchool Site/ State18.78.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

These training consisted of bi-monthly\rprofessional development sessions on minimum days in addition to full day grade level team planning days.
