Madison teachers receive training in strategies to\rsupport English Learners which provided instructional expertise in implementing the core adoption while delivering quality instruction to our English\rLearner students. Madison utilizes the biweekly minimum day for additional staff development on topics that are aligned to the district's instructional\rdepartment and facilitated by the principal.\r\rOur professional development this year is focused primarily on three areas. First is supporting teachers in effective instructional practices to implement\rthe Common Core standards. The second area of focus is on becoming more familiar with integrating technology into curriculum design. Teachers are\rsupported in the use of technology as an educational tool within the classroom.  Another area of focus is on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)\rwhich provide time for teachers to collaborate with their grade level, analyze assessment results, identify curricular areas that need re-teaching, and\rshare of effective instructional strategies to address certain standards within the content areas that need improvement. District Instructional Support\rCoaches and administration provide model lessons on the above strategies to teachers.  ... Unnamed: 6

Madison teachers receive training in strategies to\rsupport English Learners which provided instructional expertise in implementing the core adoption while delivering quality instruction to our English\rLearner students. Madison utilizes the biweekly minimum day for additional staff development on topics that are aligned to the district's instructional\rdepartment and facilitated by the principal.\r\rOur professional development this year is focused primarily on three areas. First is supporting teachers in effective instructional practices to implement\rthe Common Core standards. The second area of focus is on becoming more familiar with integrating technology into curriculum design. Teachers are\rsupported in the use of technology as an educational tool within the classroom.  Another area of focus is on Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)\rwhich provide time for teachers to collaborate with their grade level, analyze assessment results, identify curricular areas that need re-teaching, and\rshare of effective instructional strategies to address certain standards within the content areas that need improvement. District Instructional Support\rCoaches and administration provide model lessons on the above strategies to teachers.  ... Unnamed: 11
