The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district-wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years all teachers at Rancho de la Nación School\rwill receive approximately 30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This\rprofessional development will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands-on,\rresearch-based professional development, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the\rimplementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math\reducation researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted\rin our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework.\rThe ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the\rneed for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have\rbeen delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and\rduring individual teacher planning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and\rEnglish Language Development. This provides opportunity for the Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all\rteachers will receive staff development in the implementation of our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous\rreading,our district officehasadoptedtheAmericanReadingCompany100 book libraries.Allteachers willreceivestaffdevelopment on the\rimplementation and best practices used for these reading baskets for students. Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-\remotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the\rimplementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms\rin order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. The focus for teacher training includes effective instructional\rstrategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training\rin writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs\rand teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students.

The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district-wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years all teachers at Rancho de la Nación School\rwill receive approximately 30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This\rprofessional development will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands-on,\rresearch-based professional development, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the\rimplementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math\reducation researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted\rin our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework.\rThe ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the\rneed for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have\rbeen delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and\rduring individual teacher planning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and\rEnglish Language Development. This provides opportunity for the Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all\rteachers will receive staff development in the implementation of our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous\rreading,our district officehasadoptedtheAmericanReadingCompany100 book libraries.Allteachers willreceivestaffdevelopment on the\rimplementation and best practices used for these reading baskets for students. Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-\remotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the\rimplementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms\rin order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students. The focus for teacher training includes effective instructional\rstrategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training\rin writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific training to support the needs of English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs\rand teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students.
