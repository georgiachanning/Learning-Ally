Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exemplary teachers in the District as well as receive\rdistrict training and attend professional workshops and seminars.\r\rProfessional development is an on-going process at Tilley; both for administrators and teachers.  To create a culture where all students are actively\rengaged in their learning, most teachers have participated in Kagan Training. Several teachers also attended The Daily 5 training to learn specific\rclassroom management strategies to be used during small group instruction.  To continue to create and maintain a rigorous learning environment, some\rof our teachers attended a Cognitive Guided Instruction training to increase the rigor, all while reasoning in mathematics.\r\rEvery other week, teachers participate in staff development after school. Professional learning content is designed based on reflective data analysis to\rdetermine the academic, behavioral, and social-emotional needs of students. Professional learning is delivered on-site and at the District Office by site\radministration, District Instructional Support Coaches, District Office support staff, and other educational professionals. Teachers are supported in\rtraining to practice by site administrators and District Instructional Support Coaches. Site administrators conduct weekly informal drop-in observations\rand provide constructive feedback. District Instructional Support Coaches, along with site administration, provide demonstration lessons, co-planning/co-\rteaching of lessons, and targeted support based on need. Grade level teacher Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) meet at least twice weekly to\ranalyze student learning, discuss specific literacy supports for students, and adjust classroom instruction.\r\rThe professional learning focus this year includes the following: Effective instructional planning and best teaching practices to implement integrated and\rdesignated English Language Development (ELD),  providing quality guided reading and/or small group instruction in all classrooms, utilizing running\rrecords and other forms of assessment for progress monitoring, and strategies for intentional silent reading. Ongoing support and learning for how to\raddress the social-emotional needs of students will continue as well.  ... Unnamed: 6

Induction program teachers are given the opportunity to observe exemplary teachers in the District as well as receive\rdistrict training and attend professional workshops and seminars.\r\rProfessional development is an on-going process at Tilley; both for administrators and teachers.  To create a culture where all students are actively\rengaged in their learning, most teachers have participated in Kagan Training. Several teachers also attended The Daily 5 training to learn specific\rclassroom management strategies to be used during small group instruction.  To continue to create and maintain a rigorous learning environment, some\rof our teachers attended a Cognitive Guided Instruction training to increase the rigor, all while reasoning in mathematics.\r\rEvery other week, teachers participate in staff development after school. Professional learning content is designed based on reflective data analysis to\rdetermine the academic, behavioral, and social-emotional needs of students. Professional learning is delivered on-site and at the District Office by site\radministration, District Instructional Support Coaches, District Office support staff, and other educational professionals. Teachers are supported in\rtraining to practice by site administrators and District Instructional Support Coaches. Site administrators conduct weekly informal drop-in observations\rand provide constructive feedback. District Instructional Support Coaches, along with site administration, provide demonstration lessons, co-planning/co-\rteaching of lessons, and targeted support based on need. Grade level teacher Professional Learning Communities (PLC's) meet at least twice weekly to\ranalyze student learning, discuss specific literacy supports for students, and adjust classroom instruction.\r\rThe professional learning focus this year includes the following: Effective instructional planning and best teaching practices to implement integrated and\rdesignated English Language Development (ELD),  providing quality guided reading and/or small group instruction in all classrooms, utilizing running\rrecords and other forms of assessment for progress monitoring, and strategies for intentional silent reading. Ongoing support and learning for how to\raddress the social-emotional needs of students will continue as well.  ... Unnamed: 11
