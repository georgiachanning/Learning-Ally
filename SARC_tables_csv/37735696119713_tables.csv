Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In Me program website and\rthrough school created websites. Teacher also receive teacher guides and books to support their learning of the Leader In Me program.

This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In Me program website and\rthrough school created websites. Teacher also receive teacher guides and books to support their learning of the Leader In Me program. These professional\rdevelopment opportunities will all be held at Nichols Elementary.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$44,351$51,374School Site-12947.133810.089137.04$78,006\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$75,082$80,151D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,137.87$81,388.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,969$100,143-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,269$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$127,602$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$130,709$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$257,005$245,810\rSchool Site/District0.0-4.2\r\rSchool Site/ State19.6-5.0\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In Me program website and\rthrough school created websites. Teacher also receive teacher guides and books to support their learning of the Leader In Me program.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

Teacher training over the past\rthree years has focused on Reading/Writing instruction in Language Arts, continuing ongoing Math professional development, technology in the\rclassrooms, and English language development. This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities.

This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In Me program website and\rthrough school created websites.

This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In Me program website and\rthrough school created websites.

This year the district adopted a new language arts curriculum and assessment program. Teachers have\rreceived multiple days of training related to the curriculum and assessment program. Every other week teachers participate in site based professional\rdevelopment activities to further knowledge of both the new curriculum and assessment.  Teachers work with teams to collaboratively plan and better\runderstand the new curriculum and assessment program.  Teams collaborate, share materials and have access to district online materials/guidelines.\rWe are in our third year implementing the Leader in Me program. All staff will receive 1-2 days of formal training, as well as monthly on site training and\rcollaborative opportunities. Teachers are provided Leader in Me materials in a shared digital folder, through the Leader In Me program website and\rthrough school created websites. Teacher also receive teacher guides and books to support their learning of the Leader In Me program.
