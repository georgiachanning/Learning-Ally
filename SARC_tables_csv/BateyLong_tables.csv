The educational foundation in place at Edna Batey speaks\rto the hard work and dedication of the staff and community in the previous years and we are excited to be a part of this\rschool.\rThe EGUSD mission is to challenge all of our students to realize their greatest potential. That is clearly evident in all that our\rstaff supports for our students. We are committed to a region-wide effort that supports our district's mission, from our\rTransitional K classes through 12th grade. The administrators of the Pleasant Grove Region recognize that it takes all of us\rto work together.\rWe welcome parents as partners in their child's learning adventure. Parent involvement is an essential component of our\rschool. Your support is given, recognized, and appreciated. Some parents help plan the programs and policies, while others\rserve as classroom volunteers, plan family activities, or serve as art docents. We welcome parental input at any time through\rour School Site Council meetings, English Language Advisory Committee, the PTA, or any number of other committees.\rParents also support student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a\rclear message that education and regular school attendance are important to the family.\rAt Batey, our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) system continues to be successful. Together we support\rthe BOBCAT PACT and expect students and staff to honor our agreements to Be Safe, Responsible, Respectful, and\rResourceful. We enjoy a positive school environment not only for our students, but for our staff and parents as well. Thank\ryou for your continued support.\rRespectfully,\rJason Campbell                     Unnamed: 0

The educational foundation in place at Edna Batey speaks\rto the hard work and dedication of the staff and community in the previous years and we are excited to be a part of this\rschool.\rThe EGUSD mission is to challenge all of our students to realize their greatest potential. That is clearly evident in all that our\rstaff supports for our students. We are committed to a region-wide effort that supports our district's mission, from our\rTransitional K classes through 12th grade. The administrators of the Pleasant Grove Region recognize that it takes all of us\rto work together.\rWe welcome parents as partners in their child's learning adventure. Parent involvement is an essential component of our\rschool. Your support is given, recognized, and appreciated. Some parents help plan the programs and policies, while others\rserve as classroom volunteers, plan family activities, or serve as art docents. We welcome parental input at any time through\rour School Site Council meetings, English Language Advisory Committee, the PTA, or any number of other committees.\rParents also support student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a\rclear message that education and regular school attendance are important to the family.\rAt Batey, our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) system continues to be successful. Together we support\rthe BOBCAT PACT and expect students and staff to honor our agreements to Be Safe, Responsible, Respectful, and\rResourceful.

The educational foundation in place at Edna Batey speaks\rto the hard work and dedication of the staff and community in the previous years and we are excited to be a part of this\rschool.\rThe EGUSD mission is to challenge all of our students to realize their greatest potential. That is clearly evident in all that our\rstaff supports for our students. We are committed to a region-wide effort that supports our district's mission, from our\rTransitional K classes through 12th grade. The administrators of the Pleasant Grove Region recognize that it takes all of us\rto work together.\rWe welcome parents as partners in their child's learning adventure. Parent involvement is an essential component of our\rschool. Your support is given, recognized, and appreciated. Some parents help plan the programs and policies, while others\rserve as classroom volunteers, plan family activities, or serve as art docents. We welcome parental input at any time through\rour School Site Council meetings, English Language Advisory Committee, the PTA, or any number of other committees.\rParents also support student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a\rclear message that education and regular school attendance are important to the family.\rAt Batey, our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) system continues to be successful. Together we support\rthe BOBCAT PACT and expect students and staff to honor our agreements to Be Safe, Responsible, Respectful, and\rResourceful.

The educational foundation in place at Edna Batey speaks\rto the hard work and dedication of the staff and community in the previous years and we are excited to be a part of this\rschool.\rThe EGUSD mission is to challenge all of our students to realize their greatest potential. That is clearly evident in all that our\rstaff supports for our students. We are committed to a region-wide effort that supports our district's mission, from our\rTransitional K classes through 12th grade. The administrators of the Pleasant Grove Region recognize that it takes all of us\rto work together.\rWe welcome parents as partners in their child's learning adventure. Parent involvement is an essential component of our\rschool. Your support is given, recognized, and appreciated. Some parents help plan the programs and policies, while others\rserve as classroom volunteers, plan family activities, or serve as art docents. We welcome parental input at any time through\rour School Site Council meetings, English Language Advisory Committee, the PTA, or any number of other committees.\rParents also support student success by providing space, time, and encouragement for daily homework and by sending a\rclear message that education and regular school attendance are important to the family.\rAt Batey, our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support (PBIS) system continues to be successful. Together we support\rthe BOBCAT PACT and expect students and staff to honor our agreements to Be Safe, Responsible, Respectful, and\rResourceful. We enjoy a positive school environment not only for our students, but for our staff and parents as well. Thank\ryou for your continued support.\rRespectfully,\rJason Campbell              Unnamed: 0

Emergency repair needs are immediately resolved by either the\rschool custodian or district maintenance staff. The school’s custodians work as a team and with the principal to develop a\rdaily cleaning process and schedule. Each morning the custodian inspects the school prior to students and staff entering\rschool grounds. Restrooms are inspected throughout the day to ensure that they are adequately stocked, safe, and sanitary.\rThe Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards for all schools in the district.\rThe State Deferred Maintenance Program (DMP) was established in 1980 to aid districts in major maintenance projects.\rBeginning with the 2013-2014 fiscal year and the inception of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) the State has\rintended for Deferred Maintenance needs and expenses to be included in the District's LCFF allotment. The district continues\rto fund routine projects previously considered as part of the State's former DMP at levels required by the State and continues\rto use local resources.\rMaintenance continues to keep the site upgraded. Our main playground was resurfaced during the summer of 2015.  ... Unnamed: 2

The "Percent Met or Exceeded" is calculated by taking the total\rnumber of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 5

Our Learning Center team works with teachers to support\rstudents who are on an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or are not meeting grade level standards. Strong\rcollaboration between the general education staff and the Learning Center ensure that all students have an opportunity to be\rsuccessful in school. We support an Inclusion program and ASD classes for students who qualify for the programs. Our\rintervention team includes teachers that support English Learners in the classroom in small groups. We offer some\rIntersession and Extended Day classes based on student need.
