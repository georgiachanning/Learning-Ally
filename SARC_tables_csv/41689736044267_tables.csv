Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.

Teachers continued to learn how to implement the CCSS Math and ELA,\rand a variety of other curriculum support programs and best practices. Professional development has also emphasized the establishment of curriculum\rmaps and pacing guides for all core subjects as all departments investigate, collaborate around, and formalize curriculum pacing guides that assign fidelity\rto the curriculum. The Millbrae School District professional development consists of two full days during the school year. The focus is on newly adopted\rSocial Emotional Learning program and student wellness. Every Wednesday is shortened by an hour in order to allow time for teachers to collaborate on\rschool wide topics. Our professional development continues to include an emphasis on the delivery of the BARK code of conduct inside and outside of\rthe classroom and we seek professional learning experiences that as well maintain and improve our staff wellness.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$40,004$49,378School Site-$5,013$70$4,943$78,744\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$77,759$77,190-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$7,191$79,905.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$100,170$96,607S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$77,619.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$123,064$122,074\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,453$126,560Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$126,920\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$176,868$189,346\rSchool Site/District-37.1-1.1\r\rSchool Site/ State-37.60.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries39%36%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.\r\rTypes of Services Funded\rState Lottery funds are used to purchase our support curriculum, instructional materials and web based programs.
