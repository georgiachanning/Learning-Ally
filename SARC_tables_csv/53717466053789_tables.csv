These areas were selected by staff as part of the yearly program and\rplan review process and regularly reviewed and sometimes modified at Teacher Meetings.  Professional development is delivered in a variety of ways\rincluding attendance at workshops, after school program workshops and classroom mentoring.  The district received a $25,000 grant to support\rprofessional development in the 2018/2019 school year.
