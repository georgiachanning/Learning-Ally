District coaches,\ras well as our Common Core Math Leads, are providing the staff with trainings focused on math once a month.\r\rIn addition to receiving training at least once a month in math, teachers are being trained to become a Professional Learning Community as well as to\rlearn about the district's Instructional Practice Priorities. These trainings occur once a month as well. The teachers receive at least professional\rdevelopment afternoons twice a month. In addition to this training, teachers meet twice a week to collaborate and one to two days in the summer to\rplan.\r\rIndividual teachers, as well as grade level teams, call on district trainers to model lessons. Teachers also observe each other's lessons to learn from each\rother. These practices occur one to four times a year.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$52,733$51,374School Site-13282.923595.709687.2298555.11\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$81,762$80,151D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A9174.34$88,239.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$107,259$100,143S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$82,031.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$135,001$126,896\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$153,836$133,668Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$139,258$143,746\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$269,120$245,810\rSchool Site/District5.411.0\r\rSchool Site/ State25.418.3\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries35%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%5%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

In addition to this training, teachers meet twice a week to collaborate and one to two days in the summer to\rplan.\r\rIndividual teachers, as well as grade level teams, call on district trainers to model lessons.
