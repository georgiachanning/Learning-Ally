In alignment with the district's long-range curriculum plan, staff development opportunities are available for\rteachers, support personnel, administrators, and classified staff. Additionally, staff members are also encouraged to request release time to attend\rconferences, seminars, or training opportunities that will directly impact their instruction to create the most relevant and engaging learning experiences\rfor our students. All training and curriculum development at Sowers Middle School revolves around the Common Core State Standards and best practices.\rTeachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed local and state proficiency levels. Examples of professional\rdevelopment include Kelly Gallagher (ELA), ELA Textbook Adoption, NGSS training and collaboration, PLC collaboration, and relationship building learning\rexperiences with staff.\r\rHuntington Beach City School District regularly collaborates with all levels of district and school site staff when developing professional development\ractivities.Instructionalprogramimprovementisdrivenbystudentneedsandguidedbystatestandardsandframeworks.Districtandschool\radministrators use site trend analyses, state testing, district-level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to identify more\reffective methods and strategies to achieve positive results for teachers and students. The Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals\rmeet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, instructional materials, implementation timelines, and student achievement. Feedback is\rgathered at the site level through direct input and staff observation. The Sowers Middle School staff is continually involved in a process of curriculum\rdevelopment and staff training. District goals and objectives, constructed in keeping with state frameworks, are used to set achievable benchmarks. Each\rcontent area, PLC, meets monthly to assess and refine its educational goals. Individual departments, the Viking Leadership Team (shared leadership\rgroup), the principal, and the School Site Council continually monitor the school plan. A major component of the school plan is staff development and\rcollaboration. As needs are identified, training sessions are developed, in keeping with the district's direction, state frameworks, and recommended\rcurricula.\r\rTeachers new to the profession are supported by peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in-services offered by the Orange County Department of\rEducation. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject-specific seminars and major conferences and share what they learn with other staff members.\rThese programs offer additional support and opportunities to new teachers. The program is designed to expand and deepen their teaching skills, help\rthe school district retain more new teachers, and improve learning opportunities for students. Classified staff and instructional assistants are provided\rtraining and development opportunities at the school, district, and county levels. In-services for classified staff are geared to their specialty areas.  ... Unnamed: 6
