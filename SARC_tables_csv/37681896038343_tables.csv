Math and Writing are the\rtwo primary/major areas of focus for the staff due to the data we received from our site and state assessments. Teachers will attend conferences,\rtrainings and after-school workshops. In-class coaching and time for weekly collaboration is provided to assist teachers throughout the school year.\r\rAcross the District:\r\rSCIENCE –\r\rThe primary areas of focus for staff and administrator development have been related to the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)\rand moving teachers and administrators into implementation.  Focus areas include: 1) Building leadership capacity, 2) Scaling up Professional Learning\rand Support to include all district teachers, 3) Planning instruction aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, 4) Collaborative planning tools for\rinstruction, and 5) Addressing supplemental instructional materials.\r\rProfessional development needs were determined via district-wide Needs Assessment Surveys, LUSD Core Leadership Team/California Next Generation\rScience Standards Early Implementation Initiative, and feedback data collected via prior professional learning events in the district.\r\rProfessional Learning for the 2019-20 school year will address all levels/cohorts of teachers and administrators in the district through continued\rleadership, pedagogy, and content training.  This will occur primarily through science lesson study for all TK-8 teachers of science to include MS ELA\rteachers, an intensive summer institute, district Professional Development days, and a review of publisher materials.\r\rCore Leadership Team and established Teacher Leaders will continue to receive training in the areas of Leadership, Facilitation of Professional Learning\rfor their peers, and deepening understanding of NGSS innovations, planning, and pedagogy via the NGSS Early Implementation Initiative Program.\r“Expansion” (all other district teachers) teachers will be provided NGSS professional learning facilitated by their district Teacher Leader peers through\rthe established lesson study model, Summer Institute opportunities, and district PD days.\rOther opportunities for science professional learning include supplemental material/planning work supported by a CA Regional Environmental Education\rCommunity (CREEC) partnership, and instructional material evaluation.\r\rAdministrator professional learning will address NGSS innovations, strategies to identify and support high quality science instruction (observations and\rfeedback) and sustainability.
