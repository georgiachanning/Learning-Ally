Staff development in-\rservices are scheduled prior to the beginning of the school year as well as throughout the year based on input gathered from the staff. Maple Creek staff\rconstantly seeks to improve its teaching practices and strategies, as well as its use of technology through release time for a variety of trainings, grade-\rlevel meetings and in-service experiences. Early student dismissal on Wednesdays provides teachers an additional 90 minutes weekly to collaborate and\rarticulate within their grade-level professional learning teams and across grade levels.\r\rThroughout the year, we use our faculty meeting days and Wednesday early release days for professional development. Our goal with professional\rdevelopment is to improve instructional practices to help all students reach and maintain academic proficiency. Over the past few years, professional\rdevelopment has concentrated on the development of a Mastery Learning model, professional learning communities, Kagan strategies, Growth Mindset,\rCultural proficiency, innovative instruction through technology, reading comprehension and writing instruction, best instructional practices, and use of\rtechnology and data to inform instruction. Our teachers at Maple Creek are role models of lifelong learning. Many of our veteran teachers have their\rmaster’s degrees. All staff members are encouraged to attend professional-development seminars offered in and out of the district, particularly those\raligned with our goal of all students meeting and maintaining academic proficiency. Upon attendance and completion of professional development, all\rteachers are strongly encouraged to share their knowledge of new practices with all staff.\r\rIn 2018-19, we will continue to work toward deeper implementation of our professional learning teams. Our professional learning teams (grade-level\rteams) will continue to center conversations on data. Our grade-level teams regularly review both formative and summative assessment data to identify\rareas of strength and weakness. After reviewing data, they develop instructional goals and adjust their instruction. We have an identified MTSS (multi-\rtiered support system) in place to support all students to academic success. Our intervention is targeted and progress monitored every two weeks. Our\rfocus on Writing and Close reading continue this year.\r\rTeachers are supported in several ways, for example: administrative participation in professional learning teams; teacher data meetings; informal walk-\rthrough with coaching; and by conversations on data, best instructional practices and research.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

Staff development in-\rservices are scheduled prior to the beginning of the school year as well as throughout the year based on input gathered from the staff. Maple Creek staff\rconstantly seeks to improve its teaching practices and strategies, as well as its use of technology through release time for a variety of trainings, grade-\rlevel meetings and in-service experiences. Early student dismissal on Wednesdays provides teachers an additional 90 minutes weekly to collaborate and\rarticulate within their grade-level professional learning teams and across grade levels.\r\rThroughout the year, we use our faculty meeting days and Wednesday early release days for professional development. Our goal with professional\rdevelopment is to improve instructional practices to help all students reach and maintain academic proficiency. Over the past few years, professional\rdevelopment has concentrated on the development of a Mastery Learning model, professional learning communities, Kagan strategies, Growth Mindset,\rCultural proficiency, innovative instruction through technology, reading comprehension and writing instruction, best instructional practices, and use of\rtechnology and data to inform instruction. Our teachers at Maple Creek are role models of lifelong learning. Many of our veteran teachers have their\rmaster’s degrees. All staff members are encouraged to attend professional-development seminars offered in and out of the district, particularly those\raligned with our goal of all students meeting and maintaining academic proficiency. Upon attendance and completion of professional development, all\rteachers are strongly encouraged to share their knowledge of new practices with all staff.\r\rIn 2018-19, we will continue to work toward deeper implementation of our professional learning teams. Our professional learning teams (grade-level\rteams) will continue to center conversations on data. Our grade-level teams regularly review both formative and summative assessment data to identify\rareas of strength and weakness. After reviewing data, they develop instructional goals and adjust their instruction. We have an identified MTSS (multi-\rtiered support system) in place to support all students to academic success. Our intervention is targeted and progress monitored every two weeks. Our\rfocus on Writing and Close reading continue this year.\r\rTeachers are supported in several ways, for example: administrative participation in professional learning teams; teacher data meetings; informal walk-\rthrough with coaching; and by conversations on data, best instructional practices and research.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...
