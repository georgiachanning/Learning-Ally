The staff started the school year by collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior\ryear. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focused on Math with\remphasis on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to support\rimplementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop computer carts. Direct\rInstruction professional development was provided from both the district, as well as the principal for new teachers. Strategies were then refined through\rin-class coaching, modeling and observations.\r\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$53,377$49,084School Site-5,223.254,926.87296.38$80,994\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$78,483$76,091-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A1,395.75$75,089.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$99,437$95,728S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$78,059.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,146$118,990\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$133,004$125,674Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$160,171$137,589\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$212,203$230,096\rSchool Site/District-129.90.0\r\rSchool Site/ State-184.05.7\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%35%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

The staff started the school year by collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior\ryear. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focused on Math with\remphasis on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to support\rimplementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop computer carts.

The staff started the school year by collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior\ryear. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focused on Math with\remphasis on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to support\rimplementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop computer carts. Direct\rInstruction professional development was provided from both the district, as well as the principal for new teachers.

The staff started the school year by collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior\ryear. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focused on Math with\remphasis on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to support\rimplementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop computer carts. Direct\rInstruction professional development was provided from both the district, as well as the principal for new teachers.

The staff started the school year by collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior\ryear. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focused on Math with\remphasis on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to support\rimplementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop computer carts.

The staff started the school year by collecting data on both the needs of their students and on reflecting on teaching practices from the prior\ryear. School needs were then determined from conversations during this data analysis component. Professional development focused on Math with\remphasis on how to navigate through the newly adopted curriculum and EL strategies. Books were purchased about number talks to support\rimplementation. Professional development also focused on the implementation of technology in the classroom with the laptop computer carts.
