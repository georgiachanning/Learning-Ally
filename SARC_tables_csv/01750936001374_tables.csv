Since its establishment, staff,\rstudents, and families have joined together to create a community that ensures all children have the\raccess, skills, resources, knowledge, and experiences to prepare them for future college and career\rendeavors. In classrooms, on the playground, and in our global community we want our students to\rvaluediversityandtobeinclusiveleaders,problemsolvers,pursuersofknowledge,effective\rcommunicators, and creative thinkers. Therefore, we provide them with a rigorous and relevant core\racademic foundation that is centered on character development, higher order thinking skills, teamwork,\rtechnology, and 21st century learning skills. Our goal is for our diverse population of learners to become\rcompassionate, ethical, and inquisitive global citizens. Presently, we serve 910 students in preschool\rthrough the fifth grade.  We also serve three moderate-severe and one mild-moderate in Specialized\r--------Academic Instruction (SAI) classes.  Within our population, 33% of our students are white, 32% are Asian,\rDublin Unified School District17% are Hispanic or Latino, 13% are Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, 10% are Two or More Races, 7%\r7471 Larkdale Avenueare English Language Learners, and 6% have Learning Disabilities.\rDublin, CA 94568\r(925) 828-2551Toguideourinstructionalpractice,DublinElementaryhasplaceditsfocusontheLocalControl\rwww.dublinusd.orgAccountability Plan’s (LCAP) following state priorities: Priority #2 Implementation of Common Core\r\rStandards-SmarterBalancedAssessments,Priority#4PupilAchievement,andPriority#8Pupil\rDistrict Governing Board\rOutcomes.

Since its establishment, staff,\rstudents, and families have joined together to create a community that ensures all children have the\raccess, skills, resources, knowledge, and experiences to prepare them for future college and career\rendeavors. In classrooms, on the playground, and in our global community we want our students to\rvaluediversityandtobeinclusiveleaders,problemsolvers,pursuersofknowledge,effective\rcommunicators, and creative thinkers. Therefore, we provide them with a rigorous and relevant core\racademic foundation that is centered on character development, higher order thinking skills, teamwork,\rtechnology, and 21st century learning skills. Our goal is for our diverse population of learners to become\rcompassionate, ethical, and inquisitive global citizens. Presently, we serve 910 students in preschool\rthrough the fifth grade.  We also serve three moderate-severe and one mild-moderate in Specialized\r--------Academic Instruction (SAI) classes.  Within our population, 33% of our students are white, 32% are Asian,\rDublin Unified School District17% are Hispanic or Latino, 13% are Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, 10% are Two or More Races, 7%\r7471 Larkdale Avenueare English Language Learners, and 6% have Learning Disabilities.\rDublin, CA 94568\r(925) 828-2551Toguideourinstructionalpractice,DublinElementaryhasplaceditsfocusontheLocalControl\rwww.dublinusd.orgAccountability Plan’s (LCAP) following state priorities: Priority #2 Implementation of Common Core\r\rStandards-SmarterBalancedAssessments,Priority#4PupilAchievement,andPriority#8Pupil\rDistrict Governing Board\rOutcomes.

Content for two of the three days is usually determined by DUSD based on areas of focus, textbook adoption\rcycles, and DUSD's Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). In alignment with this focus, the teachers, specialists, and administrators at Dublin\rElementary School examine state, formative, and common formative assessments to refine our instructional vision and to modify our intervention and\renrichment supports strategically. This collaborative work assists us in designing our third staff development day for the school year.\r\rAdditional staff development opportunities take place during trainings where teachers are released through use of substitutes to attend observational\rrounds, demonstration lessons, workshops, and/or conferences. They also occur during after school workshops, grade level collaborations, Response to\rIntervention Consult (RTI) meetings, leadership meetings, staff meetings, and through the use of site-based instructional coaches.\r\rEducators partake in the following professional development opportunities to support our LCAP and instructional vision:\r•Safety Care training.\r•Capturing Kids' Hearts training (by the Flippin Group)\r•Tri-Valley Teacher Induction Project (TV/TIP) for new teachers\r•Technology Coaching for a variety of software and hardware\r•Illuminate (data management system) training in analyzing student data\r•Site coaching by an Instructional Coach in literacy and mathematics.\r•Site training by an English Language Development Coach.\r•Site training by a Science Coach.\rAlong with these professional development opportunities, teachers have piloted the adoption of new textbooks, served on DUSD committees to develop\rinterim assessments, and attended workshops to improve their skills. In addition, we dismiss students at 2:00 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday to allow time\rfor teachers to collaborate, both within and across grade levels. We also have 21 days district wide where students are released at 2:00 so teachers can\rcollaborate.\r\rWe also hold three district-wide professional development days each school year.  ...

Content for two of the three days is usually determined by DUSD based on areas of focus, textbook adoption\rcycles, and DUSD's Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). In alignment with this focus, the teachers, specialists, and administrators at Dublin\rElementary School examine state, formative, and common formative assessments to refine our instructional vision and to modify our intervention and\renrichment supports strategically. This collaborative work assists us in designing our third staff development day for the school year.\r\rAdditional staff development opportunities take place during trainings where teachers are released through use of substitutes to attend observational\rrounds, demonstration lessons, workshops, and/or conferences. They also occur during after school workshops, grade level collaborations, Response to\rIntervention Consult (RTI) meetings, leadership meetings, staff meetings, and through the use of site-based instructional coaches.\r\rEducators partake in the following professional development opportunities to support our LCAP and instructional vision:\r•Safety Care training.\r•Capturing Kids' Hearts training (by the Flippin Group)\r•Tri-Valley Teacher Induction Project (TV/TIP) for new teachers\r•Technology Coaching for a variety of software and hardware\r•Illuminate (data management system) training in analyzing student data\r•Site coaching by an Instructional Coach in literacy and mathematics.\r•Site training by an English Language Development Coach.\r•Site training by a Science Coach.\rAlong with these professional development opportunities, teachers have piloted the adoption of new textbooks, served on DUSD committees to develop\rinterim assessments, and attended workshops to improve their skills. In addition, we dismiss students at 2:00 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday to allow time\rfor teachers to collaborate, both within and across grade levels. We also have 21 days district wide where students are released at 2:00 so teachers can\rcollaborate.\r\rWe also hold three district-wide professional development days each school year.  ...
