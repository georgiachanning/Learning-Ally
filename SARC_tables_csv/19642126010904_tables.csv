Recognizing that all learners are unique, learning experiences must take into\raccount the abilities, interest, and learning style of individual students.  Twice a year during the six\rweek cluster, students spend one hour a week exploring a topic of interest with the assistance of\rknowledgeable community members.  Along with gaining in-depth insight into a particular topic,\rstudents begin to take responsibility and interest in their own learning.  The regular curriculum is\rsupported, expanded and enhanced by children participating in enrichment activities and bringing\rtheir enthusiasm into the classroom setting.  Student and cluster leaders communicate what they\r------\rhave accomplished at a schoolwide celebration to culminate the Enrichment Clusters Program.\r--\rThese educational opportunities, supported by an excellent teaching staff, create a first rate\rABC Unified School District\reducational opportunity that is both challenging and enjoyable for Carver Academy students.

Recognizing that all learners are unique, learning experiences must take into\raccount the abilities, interest, and learning style of individual students.  Twice a year during the six\rweek cluster, students spend one hour a week exploring a topic of interest with the assistance of\rknowledgeable community members.  Along with gaining in-depth insight into a particular topic,\rstudents begin to take responsibility and interest in their own learning.  The regular curriculum is\rsupported, expanded and enhanced by children participating in enrichment activities and bringing\rtheir enthusiasm into the classroom setting.  Student and cluster leaders communicate what they\r------\rhave accomplished at a schoolwide celebration to culminate the Enrichment Clusters Program.\r--\rThese educational opportunities, supported by an excellent teaching staff, create a first rate\rABC Unified School District\reducational opportunity that is both challenging and enjoyable for Carver Academy students.

Recognizing that all learners are unique, learning experiences must take into\raccount the abilities, interest, and learning style of individual students.  Twice a year during the six\rweek cluster, students spend one hour a week exploring a topic of interest with the assistance of\rknowledgeable community members.  Along with gaining in-depth insight into a particular topic,\rstudents begin to take responsibility and interest in their own learning.  The regular curriculum is\rsupported, expanded and enhanced by children participating in enrichment activities and bringing\rtheir enthusiasm into the classroom setting.  Student and cluster leaders communicate what they\r------\rhave accomplished at a schoolwide celebration to culminate the Enrichment Clusters Program.\r--\rThese educational opportunities, supported by an excellent teaching staff, create a first rate\rABC Unified School District\reducational opportunity that is both challenging and enjoyable for Carver Academy students.

Recognizing that all learners are unique, learning experiences must take into\raccount the abilities, interest, and learning style of individual students.  Twice a year during the six\rweek cluster, students spend one hour a week exploring a topic of interest with the assistance of\rknowledgeable community members.  Along with gaining in-depth insight into a particular topic,\rstudents begin to take responsibility and interest in their own learning.  The regular curriculum is\rsupported, expanded and enhanced by children participating in enrichment activities and bringing\rtheir enthusiasm into the classroom setting.  Student and cluster leaders communicate what they\r------\rhave accomplished at a schoolwide celebration to culminate the Enrichment Clusters Program.\r--\rThese educational opportunities, supported by an excellent teaching staff, create a first rate\rABC Unified School District\reducational opportunity that is both challenging and enjoyable for Carver Academy students.
