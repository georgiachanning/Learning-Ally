Riverview keeps abreast of new strategies and technology through release time for a variety of conferences, grade level meetings and\rin-service experiences. Early student dismissal on Wednesdays provides teachers an additional 90 minutes each week to collaborate regarding student\rlearning as an entire grade-level team as well as to articulate with other grade levels to strengthen Riverview’s journey as a Professional Learning\rCommunity.\r\rProfessional development is ongoing to ensure staff is building shared knowledge associated with essential standards, goal setting, common assessments,\ranalysis of student assessment data, research-based best practices and applied technology in the field of education. The training is consistent with the\rschool goals for curriculum, instruction and assessment for continuous improvement in student learning for all.\r\rAn effective process for professional development and curriculum improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrators. Topics\rrelevant to the needs and priorities of the school are identified early in the year, and staff-development sessions are scheduled accordingly. Professional\rdevelopment has focused on the process of Professional Learning Communities with an emphasis on the new Common Core State Standards along with\rwriting instruction, methods to improve reading and writing instruction, technology, curriculum mapping, differentiated instruction, and data-driven\rdecision making aligned with continuous improvement strategies.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school year.\rOne hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

Riverview keeps abreast of new strategies and technology through release time for a variety of conferences, grade level meetings and\rin-service experiences. Early student dismissal on Wednesdays provides teachers an additional 90 minutes each week to collaborate regarding student\rlearning as an entire grade-level team as well as to articulate with other grade levels to strengthen Riverview’s journey as a Professional Learning\rCommunity.\r\rProfessional development is ongoing to ensure staff is building shared knowledge associated with essential standards, goal setting, common assessments,\ranalysis of student assessment data, research-based best practices and applied technology in the field of education. The training is consistent with the\rschool goals for curriculum, instruction and assessment for continuous improvement in student learning for all.\r\rAn effective process for professional development and curriculum improvement is planned and implemented by teachers and administrators. Topics\rrelevant to the needs and priorities of the school are identified early in the year, and staff-development sessions are scheduled accordingly. Professional\rdevelopment has focused on the process of Professional Learning Communities with an emphasis on the new Common Core State Standards along with\rwriting instruction, methods to improve reading and writing instruction, technology, curriculum mapping, differentiated instruction, and data-driven\rdecision making aligned with continuous improvement strategies.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.
