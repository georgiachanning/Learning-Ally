It is no\rcoincidence that these ideals define the man for whom our school is named, Mr. Robert J. McGarvey. Our faculty is\rcommitted to these ideals and to collaboration with families and the broader community to ensure this is accomplished.\rDeveloping students' leadership potential, building a positive school climate, and creating opportunities for students to\rflourish in an environment of shared values and good character are hallmarks of our learning community. Our Positive\rBehavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) team will work diligently to equip our faculty to help in building a school where\reveryone is valued and respected, and where rules and character are explicitly taught and expected. The profile of all\rlearners in the RJMES journey - children and adults alike - is captured in the acronym S.O.A.R. which highlights the essential\rattributes of our Safe, Open-Minded, Accountable, and Resilient community.\rPartnerships with families and community agencies to provide opportunities for challenge and growth are central to our\rcommitment to serving the whole child. We will work tirelessly to provide a well-rounded experience for our children so that\rthey are ready for wherever their futures take them. Leadership experiences, GATE, English Language Development, music,\rPE, technology, athletics, and academic enrichment are all as important to the growth of the whole child as core academic\rprogram.\rThe concept of community, with an emphasis on unity, is a priority for our parents, faculty, and students. It is clear that our\rcommunity understands that a strong relationship between the home and school is a recipe for student success. I encourage\ryou to become part of our Parent Faculty Organization, an amazing group dedicated to making McGarvey a world class\rinstitution. It's in this spirit that I encourage you to become involved to support our school.

It is no\rcoincidence that these ideals define the man for whom our school is named, Mr. Robert J. McGarvey. Our faculty is\rcommitted to these ideals and to collaboration with families and the broader community to ensure this is accomplished.\rDeveloping students' leadership potential, building a positive school climate, and creating opportunities for students to\rflourish in an environment of shared values and good character are hallmarks of our learning community. Our Positive\rBehavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) team will work diligently to equip our faculty to help in building a school where\reveryone is valued and respected, and where rules and character are explicitly taught and expected. The profile of all\rlearners in the RJMES journey - children and adults alike - is captured in the acronym S.O.A.R. which highlights the essential\rattributes of our Safe, Open-Minded, Accountable, and Resilient community.\rPartnerships with families and community agencies to provide opportunities for challenge and growth are central to our\rcommitment to serving the whole child. We will work tirelessly to provide a well-rounded experience for our children so that\rthey are ready for wherever their futures take them. Leadership experiences, GATE, English Language Development, music,\rPE, technology, athletics, and academic enrichment are all as important to the growth of the whole child as core academic\rprogram.\rThe concept of community, with an emphasis on unity, is a priority for our parents, faculty, and students. It is clear that our\rcommunity understands that a strong relationship between the home and school is a recipe for student success. I encourage\ryou to become part of our Parent Faculty Organization, an amazing group dedicated to making McGarvey a world class\rinstitution. It's in this spirit that I encourage you to become involved to support our school.

It is no\rcoincidence that these ideals define the man for whom our school is named, Mr. Robert J. McGarvey. Our faculty is\rcommitted to these ideals and to collaboration with families and the broader community to ensure this is accomplished.\rDeveloping students' leadership potential, building a positive school climate, and creating opportunities for students to\rflourish in an environment of shared values and good character are hallmarks of our learning community. Our Positive\rBehavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) team will work diligently to equip our faculty to help in building a school where\reveryone is valued and respected, and where rules and character are explicitly taught and expected. The profile of all\rlearners in the RJMES journey - children and adults alike - is captured in the acronym S.O.A.R. which highlights the essential\rattributes of our Safe, Open-Minded, Accountable, and Resilient community.\rPartnerships with families and community agencies to provide opportunities for challenge and growth are central to our\rcommitment to serving the whole child. We will work tirelessly to provide a well-rounded experience for our children so that\rthey are ready for wherever their futures take them. Leadership experiences, GATE, English Language Development, music,\rPE, technology, athletics, and academic enrichment are all as important to the growth of the whole child as core academic\rprogram.\rThe concept of community, with an emphasis on unity, is a priority for our parents, faculty, and students. It is clear that our\rcommunity understands that a strong relationship between the home and school is a recipe for student success. I encourage\ryou to become part of our Parent Faculty Organization, an amazing group dedicated to making McGarvey a world class\rinstitution. It's in this spirit that I encourage you to become involved to support our school.

It is no\rcoincidence that these ideals define the man for whom our school is named, Mr. Robert J. McGarvey. Our faculty is\rcommitted to these ideals and to collaboration with families and the broader community to ensure this is accomplished.\rDeveloping students' leadership potential, building a positive school climate, and creating opportunities for students to\rflourish in an environment of shared values and good character are hallmarks of our learning community. Our Positive\rBehavior Intervention and Support (PBIS) team will work diligently to equip our faculty to help in building a school where\reveryone is valued and respected, and where rules and character are explicitly taught and expected. The profile of all\rlearners in the RJMES journey - children and adults alike - is captured in the acronym S.O.A.R. which highlights the essential\rattributes of our Safe, Open-Minded, Accountable, and Resilient community.\rPartnerships with families and community agencies to provide opportunities for challenge and growth are central to our\rcommitment to serving the whole child. We will work tirelessly to provide a well-rounded experience for our children so that\rthey are ready for wherever their futures take them. Leadership experiences, GATE, English Language Development, music,\rPE, technology, athletics, and academic enrichment are all as important to the growth of the whole child as core academic\rprogram.\rThe concept of community, with an emphasis on unity, is a priority for our parents, faculty, and students. It is clear that our\rcommunity understands that a strong relationship between the home and school is a recipe for student success. I encourage\ryou to become part of our Parent Faculty Organization, an amazing group dedicated to making McGarvey a world class\rinstitution. It's in this spirit that I encourage you to become involved to support our school.

The ï¿1⁄2Percent Met or Exceededï¿1⁄2 is calculated by taking the\rtotal number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the\rstandard on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.\rDouble dashes (--) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for\rstatistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.\rNote: The number of students tested includes students that did not receive a score; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to\rcalculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using students with scores.  ...                Unnamed: 4
