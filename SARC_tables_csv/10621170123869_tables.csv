In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school\ryear.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.
