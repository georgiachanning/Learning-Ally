As you read this report,\rI believe you will find that what emerges is a picture of a school with a commitment to excellence,\ra faculty that is professionally skilled and personally committed to meeting the learning needs of\rall students, and a student body that as a whole, is well disciplined and motivated. Our school\rcommunity has a great amount of pride and works as a family. The school staff welcomes parent\rand community participation and strives to create a partnership between parents, students, and\r-------the school. Parents are welcome to visit or work in the classrooms and are highly encouraged to\r-take part in their children's educational process.\rKerman Unified School District\r15218 W.

We will continue to\rMark Ruiz\roffer research based interventions during the school day as well as target instruction in the\rAssistant Superintendent\rclassrooms to meet their needs. We will continue to use the RTI (Response to Intervention ) model\rPersonnel\rto identify students at risk and fit them into an intervention program that will specifically service\r\rtheir deficiencies. We will continue to increase the use of technology in the classrooms to give\rKraig Magnussen\rstudents better access to the skills they need. We have also implemented the PBIS Process (Positive\rAssistant Superintendent\rBehavioral Interventions) and Supports with great success.
