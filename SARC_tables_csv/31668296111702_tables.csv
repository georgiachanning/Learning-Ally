These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies. Throughout the year, various\rafternoon workshops were also provided to address different topic areas: Differentiation, Universal Design for Learning, Visual Literacy, Vocabulary\rInstruction and others.  EUSD has also promoted a balance of growth opportunities in all MTSS domains - academic, social/emotional, and behavioral.\rThis year, the district focused on practices that promote diversity awareness and appreciation, equity, and inclusion.\r\rSummer institutes also provide teachers opportunities to extend knowledge and skills, plan and collaborate.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.

These goals were developed upon stakeholder input and analysis of various student\routcome measures, primarily CAASPP (California Assessment of Academic Student Performance and Progress). For the last 3 years, all certificated staff\rmembers participated in at least three district-wide professional development days per year focused on the implementation of the California Content\rStandards (ELA and Math), Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and research-proven instructional strategies.
