The district offers two full-day staff development days annually, and eight Wednesday afternoon sessions,\rwhere staff members are offered professional growth opportunities in curriculum, teaching strategies, and methodologies. Common Core Standards,\rNext Generation Science Standards, Project Based Learning, Readers Workshop, Writers Workshop, Math in Focus and technology infused instruction\rare being integrated into the curriculum. Teachers also review student data, make timely decisions based in data, and share practical tips and strategies\rwith each other, during their collaborative prep and meeting time. This year, we continued coaching and collaboration sessions for teachers during the\rschool day. In addition to opportunities through the district, site "Flex Funds"  as well as other targeted budgets are used to provide professional\rdevelopment to teachers to attend workshops, observe in other classrooms and to collaborate with colleagues.

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$11440$4832$6608$92,000\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8821$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-28.712.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-7.537.1\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$11440$4832$6608$92,000\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8821$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-28.712.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-7.537.1\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Areas of focus are determined by our\rStrategic Plan and LCAP, as well as input from staff on professional development surveys.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,894$45,252School Site-$11440$4832$6608$92,000\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$76,698$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$8821$82,156.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$98,539$84,472-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$125,596$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$129,835$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$192,367$124,686\rSchool Site/District-28.712.9\r\rSchool Site/ State-7.537.1\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries36%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries7%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...
