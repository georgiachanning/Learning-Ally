Professional development opportunities occur during a combination of the\rregular school day, after hours, and during the summer.

Multiple measures including CAASPP\rresults, ELPAC achievement data, common formative assessments, and data from site educational rounds were utilized to prioritize needs. Additionally,\rTUSD’s initiatives and staff input continue to drive the professional development offerings.\rStaff is provided with weekly embedded collaboration time in addition to opportunities for extended collaboration at site determined periods throughout\rthe school year.  The collaboration time allows teachers to apply new learning and make strategic decisions regarding the use of curriculum and\rassessments.\r\rYear one and year two teachers are enrolled in TUSD’s Induction Program which is in the second year of implementation. The Induction Program activities\rare based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession which outlines the numerous interconnected skills that comprise the professional\rpractices of teaching.
