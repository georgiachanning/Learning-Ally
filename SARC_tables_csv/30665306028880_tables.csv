To improve the quality of the\rprogram, Perry School staff engage in staff development. Teaching is an on-going combination of art and skill and requires teachers to continually update\rtheir craft with the best teaching practices based on research. All training and curriculum development at Perry School revolves around the Common\rCore State Standards. Just as we hope for Perry students, Perry teachers are lifelong learners.\r\rHuntington Beach City School District regularly collaborates with all levels of district and school site staff when developing professional development\ractivities in alignment with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Improving Teacher Quality Expectations. district and school administrators use site\rtrend analysis, state testing, district-level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to identify more effective methods and\rstrategies to achieve positive results for teachers and students.\r\rThe Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, instructional materials,\rimplementation timelines, and student achievement. Feedback is gathered at the site level through direct input and staff observation. Periodic Curriculum\rDevelopment Committees are formed to address identified areas of need and focus. District-level training activities and professional development are\rbased both on school site needs and district needs. Currently, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Direct Interactive Instruction (DII), Number Talks,\rSpatial Temporal (ST) Math, and the implementation of the Common Core State Standards, the implementation of McGraw Hill "My Math," and the\rimplementation of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys"  are focus areas for staff development.\r\rOn a weekly basis, the Perry school staff looks at the district and state assessment data, classroom portfolios, and work samples to determine the needs\rof students. Each grade level makes recommendations for new additional strategies, training, or supplemental materials that may help students in the\rlearning process. Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed the Common Core State Standards objectives.\rArticulation between grade levels helps to give consistency to the school program. Currently, the topics for staff development at Perry School include:\rScience Works, Technology, Research-based Title I Strategies, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Guided Language Acquisition Development (GLAD),\rNumber Talks, ST Math, Factswise, Strategies for Reading and Writing by Nancy Fetzer, Response to Intervention (RTI), Thinking Maps, Write From the\rBeginning, Path to Proficiency, Direct Interactive Instruction (DII), and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys."  Joseph R. Perry Elementary is also\rcontinuing to work on best practices with the implementation of the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).\r\rA portion of school funds is used to enable staff members to attend teaching seminars and other events designed to enhance their teaching techniques\rand expand their knowledge base. Teachers new to the profession are supported by peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in-services offered by\rthe West Orange County Consortium for Special Education or education consultants. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject-specific seminars and\rmajor conferences and share what they learn with other staff members. The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional\rsupport and opportunities to new teachers. The program is designed to assist those new to teaching to expand and deepen their teaching skills, help the\rschool district retain more new teachers, and improve learning opportunities for students. Classified staff and instructional assistants are provided\rtraining and development opportunities at the school, district, and county levels. In-services for classified staff are geared to their specialty areas.  ... Unnamed: 6

To improve the quality of the\rprogram, Perry School staff engage in staff development. Teaching is an on-going combination of art and skill and requires teachers to continually update\rtheir craft with the best teaching practices based on research. All training and curriculum development at Perry School revolves around the Common\rCore State Standards. Just as we hope for Perry students, Perry teachers are lifelong learners.\r\rHuntington Beach City School District regularly collaborates with all levels of district and school site staff when developing professional development\ractivities in alignment with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Improving Teacher Quality Expectations. district and school administrators use site\rtrend analysis, state testing, district-level assessments, teacher response, and administrator observations to identify more effective methods and\rstrategies to achieve positive results for teachers and students.\r\rThe Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services and principals meet monthly to analyze current instructional programs, instructional materials,\rimplementation timelines, and student achievement. Feedback is gathered at the site level through direct input and staff observation. Periodic Curriculum\rDevelopment Committees are formed to address identified areas of need and focus. District-level training activities and professional development are\rbased both on school site needs and district needs. Currently, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Direct Interactive Instruction (DII), Number Talks,\rSpatial Temporal (ST) Math, and the implementation of the Common Core State Standards, the implementation of McGraw Hill "My Math," and the\rimplementation of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys"  are focus areas for staff development.\r\rOn a weekly basis, the Perry school staff looks at the district and state assessment data, classroom portfolios, and work samples to determine the needs\rof students. Each grade level makes recommendations for new additional strategies, training, or supplemental materials that may help students in the\rlearning process. Teachers align classroom curriculum to ensure that all students either meet or exceed the Common Core State Standards objectives.\rArticulation between grade levels helps to give consistency to the school program. Currently, the topics for staff development at Perry School include:\rScience Works, Technology, Research-based Title I Strategies, Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), Guided Language Acquisition Development (GLAD),\rNumber Talks, ST Math, Factswise, Strategies for Reading and Writing by Nancy Fetzer, Response to Intervention (RTI), Thinking Maps, Write From the\rBeginning, Path to Proficiency, Direct Interactive Instruction (DII), and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt "Journeys."  Joseph R. Perry Elementary is also\rcontinuing to work on best practices with the implementation of the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).\r\rA portion of school funds is used to enable staff members to attend teaching seminars and other events designed to enhance their teaching techniques\rand expand their knowledge base. Teachers new to the profession are supported by peer coaching and are encouraged to attend in-services offered by\rthe West Orange County Consortium for Special Education or education consultants. Teachers are encouraged to attend subject-specific seminars and\rmajor conferences and share what they learn with other staff members. The Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program offers additional\rsupport and opportunities to new teachers. The program is designed to assist those new to teaching to expand and deepen their teaching skills, help the\rschool district retain more new teachers, and improve learning opportunities for students. Classified staff and instructional assistants are provided\rtraining and development opportunities at the school, district, and county levels. In-services for classified staff are geared to their specialty areas.  ... Unnamed: 11
