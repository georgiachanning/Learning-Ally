Advanced training\rin reading instruction, writing instruction, math instruction and classroom management strategies are conducted for all teachers. Sierra Vista teachers\rwork closely together to share ideas, strategies and plans for ensuring an exemplary education for our students. Staff-development opportunities focus\raround reading comprehension, accelerated language acquisition, math and Response to Intervention. We provide these professional development\ropportunities for all certificated staff members. Additionally, Sierra Vista utilizes categorical funding to provide ongoing staff development workshops\rfor all teachers, concentrating on instructional practices, the learning, and the alignment of the California Common Core State Standards.\r\rDuring the 2018-19 school year, inservices focused on Common Core State Standards, English Language Development, and Language Arts. These\rprofessional development in-services were designed to support certificated teachers with instructional strategies and assessing students’ mastery of the\rgrade-level standards. The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery\rlearning, multi-tiered system of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\rIn the 2018-19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year. One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional\rdevelopment and classroom coaching through the CUSD Induction program.

The district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery\rlearning, multi-tiered system of supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding.\rIn the 2018-19 school year, the district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional\rdevelopment opportunities on staff development days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also\roffered throughout the school year.
