The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\randdistrict-wideprofessionaldevelopmentthroughouttheyear.Duringthe2019-20schoolyearallteachersatElToyonSchoolwillreceive\rapproximately 30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This professional\rdevelopment will empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands-on, research-\rbasedprofessional development,standards-basedcurriculumguidesandunit plansalignedtotheCommonCore toassist our teachersinthe\rimplementation of our GoMath adoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math\reducation researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted\rin our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework.\rThe ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the\rneed for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have\rbeen delivered through teacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and\rduring individual teacher planning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and\rEnglishLanguageDevelopment.Wealso have credentialedteachersthatprovideEngineeringisElementarylessonsfor students.Thisprovides\ropportunity for the Language Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all teachers will receive staff development in the\rimplementation of our newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous reading, our district office has adopted the American\rReading Company 100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff development on the implementation and best practices used for these reading baskets\rfor students. Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom.\rCounselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have\rreceived professional development on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and\rsupports to all students. of focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best\rpractices for Data Teams collaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific\rtraining to support the needs of English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized\rtraining to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff\rgroup, grade-level teams, and through individual mentoring by the school administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction\rSupport for year one and two teachers.

The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math\reducation researchers. A focus on professional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted\rin our CAASPP data. In the area of language arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework.\rThe ELA/ELD framework professional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the\rneed for teachers to be excellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons.

Our counselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom.\rCounselors will deliver this curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery.

Teachers of students with special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized\rtraining to assist them in meeting the unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff\rgroup, grade-level teams, and through individual mentoring by the school administrator.
