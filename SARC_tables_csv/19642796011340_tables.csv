Professional learning opportunities include grade level and/or\rcontent-specific programming on full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data continues to be the\rdetermining factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last three years have been\rin the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history-social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as\rwell as the use of student data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district staff, Teachers on Special\rAssignment, as well as consultants and coaches who specialize in content-area pedagogy. Professional learning is structured in job-embedded workshops\rand professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and coaching support, and\rstudent work/data analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes strategies and pedagogy to support all learners access rigorous, grade-level\rstandards. All professional learning includes a special emphasis on supporting the development of English learners’ development of academic language\rand literacy.\r\rBeginning in 2017 through 2020, all teachers participated in six days of systematic, district-wide professional learning with a focus on instructional\rstrategies in support of our three student success drivers: academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive rigor. In addition, several opt-in days\rof various ongoing professional learning offerings were held to differentiate among grade and content levels and included standards-aligned instructional\rpractices in support of all learners, including English learners and students with disabilities; college and career readiness; and social-emotional support.\r\rIn addition to the aforementioned, district and site learning has focused on developing Professional Learning Communities (PLC) focused on a cycle of\rcontinuous improvement. In accordance with this initiative, teachers work in grade levels and study data and student work along with curriculum\rframeworks, standards, district and state assessments, and state-approved adoptions to establish learning goals, plan lessons and develop common\rformative assessments. Teachers meet regularly each week and also for extended learning opportunities each trimester. The district initiative to develop\rPositive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) provides multiple training opportunities throughout the year for the PBIS team. At Hodge, staff\rengage in extended learning related to PBIS and the Multi-tiered Systems for Support  (MTSS) provided for our students to support both their academic\rand social, emotional, and behavioral development.

Professional learning opportunities include grade level and/or\rcontent-specific programming on full and partial days as well as early student release day opportunities. Student achievement data continues to be the\rdetermining factor in the selection of professional learning topics. The primary areas of focus for professional learning in the last three years have been\rin the area of supporting teachers as it relates to math, and ELA/ELD, history-social science, and science curricula, content standards, frameworks, as\rwell as the use of student data to improve instructional practice. Professional learning is developed and facilitated by district staff, Teachers on Special\rAssignment, as well as consultants and coaches who specialize in content-area pedagogy. Professional learning is structured in job-embedded workshops\rand professional learning communities which include collaborative lesson planning, lesson study, classroom observations and coaching support, and\rstudent work/data analysis. Professional learning for all teachers includes strategies and pedagogy to support all learners access rigorous, grade-level\rstandards. All professional learning includes a special emphasis on supporting the development of English learners’ development of academic language\rand literacy.\r\rBeginning in 2017 through 2020, all teachers participated in six days of systematic, district-wide professional learning with a focus on instructional\rstrategies in support of our three student success drivers: academic discourse, collaborative practices, and cognitive rigor. In addition, several opt-in days\rof various ongoing professional learning offerings were held to differentiate among grade and content levels and included standards-aligned instructional\rpractices in support of all learners, including English learners and students with disabilities; college and career readiness; and social-emotional support.\r\rIn addition to the aforementioned, district and site learning has focused on developing Professional Learning Communities (PLC) focused on a cycle of\rcontinuous improvement. In accordance with this initiative, teachers work in grade levels and study data and student work along with curriculum\rframeworks, standards, district and state assessments, and state-approved adoptions to establish learning goals, plan lessons and develop common\rformative assessments. Teachers meet regularly each week and also for extended learning opportunities each trimester. The district initiative to develop\rPositive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) provides multiple training opportunities throughout the year for the PBIS team. At Hodge, staff\rengage in extended learning related to PBIS and the Multi-tiered Systems for Support  (MTSS) provided for our students to support both their academic\rand social, emotional, and behavioral development.
