For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.

For support, teachers received professional development from Educational Services, instructional\rcoaches, principals, and workshops at the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers participate in weekly grade level collaborative meetings and\rinstructional learning walks where they observe their colleagues' instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers\rhave been Google trained so they may use it as an instructional tool and facilitate students' presentations. In 2016, all teachers participated in GLAD\r(Guided Language Acquisition Design) to assist in effective teaching strategies for English Learners. They were participants in demonstration lessons and\rreceived feedback from GLAD trainers, instructional coaches, and principals.
