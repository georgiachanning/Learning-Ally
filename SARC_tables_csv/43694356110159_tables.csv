Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.

Also, teachers utilize the\rdistrict-sponsored middle school staff development days, which allows them to collaborate with middle school teachers in the district, within their single\rsubject area and grade level. We will alternate staff meetings to focus on PBIS, Safety, Culture, Language Acquisition, and POL. Staff meetings will be\rutilized to provide all teachers professional development related to evaluating and implementing intentional practices related to Evergreen School\rDistrict's Profile of a Learner (POL). Using the cycle of inquiry to ensure our staff understands the site's PBIS system, as well as ensure it meets the needs\rof our students.  In the realm of safety, San Jose Police Department does a refresher Run-Hide-Defend training session. Teachers in the Language Arts\rDepartment continue to participate in training sessions related to Evergreen's recently adopted ELA materials from Springboard, as well as engage in\rGoogle classroom and digital tools. Science will continue to use professional development opportunities to transition to NGSS. The Leadership teacher\rtakes advantage of annual CADA conferences to stay current.  As a site all staff members, regardless of subject ares will participate in ongoing training to\rsupport our second language learners.
