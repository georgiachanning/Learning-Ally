The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year.

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning.

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.

In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year. Minimum qualifications include: possession of a Bachelor’s Degree, possession of an appropriate\rCalifornia teaching credential, and demonstrated competence in core academic subjects.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$43,350$46,208School Site-$5,433$638$9224$67862\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$73,313$72,218D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9862$65,579.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$91,397$92,742-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$72,949.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$105,239$134,864\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$119,427$118,220Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$132,840$127,356\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$198,156$186,823\rSchool Site/District-6.51.8\r\rSchool Site/ State40.3-2.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%33%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.

In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year. Minimum qualifications include: possession of a Bachelor’s Degree, possession of an appropriate\rCalifornia teaching credential, and demonstrated competence in core academic subjects.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$43,350$46,208School Site-$5,433$638$9224$67862\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$73,313$72,218D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9862$65,579.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$91,397$92,742-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$72,949.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$105,239$134,864\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$119,427$118,220Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$132,840$127,356\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$198,156$186,823\rSchool Site/District-6.51.8\r\rSchool Site/ State40.3-2.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%33%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.

The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year.

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning.

SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year.

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.

In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year. Minimum qualifications include: possession of a Bachelor’s Degree, possession of an appropriate\rCalifornia teaching credential, and demonstrated competence in core academic subjects.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$43,350$46,208School Site-$5,433$638$9224$67862\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$73,313$72,218D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9862$65,579.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$91,397$92,742-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$72,949.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$105,239$134,864\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$119,427$118,220Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$132,840$127,356\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$198,156$186,823\rSchool Site/District-6.51.8\r\rSchool Site/ State40.3-2.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%33%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.

The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics. Staff members are also encouraged to\rparticipate in workshops and/or conferences that provide them with the latest information and trends in their particular teaching areas. Teachers are\rsupported by teacher mentors, teacher-principal coaching, and Induction support providers.\r\rHighly Qualified Teachers\rThe Every Child Will Succeed Act requires that all teachers in core subject areas meet certain requirements in order to be considered “Highly Qualified,”\rno later than the end of the 2018-19 school year. Minimum qualifications include: possession of a Bachelor’s Degree, possession of an appropriate\rCalifornia teaching credential, and demonstrated competence in core academic subjects.\r\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$43,350$46,208School Site-$5,433$638$9224$67862\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$73,313$72,218D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9862$65,579.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$91,397$92,742-S tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$72,949.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$105,239$134,864\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$119,427$118,220Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$132,840$127,356\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$198,156$186,823\rSchool Site/District-6.51.8\r\rSchool Site/ State40.3-2.6\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%33%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries5%6%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

The focus of staff development has been developed at the school site, based on the school’s annual plan for Student\rAchievement. SKUSD has employed a quarterly Benchmark Assessment window for every class. The teachers meet in their professional learning\rcommunities to review the data to steer the direction of instruction for student learning. In addition, there are regular meetings by the grade levels to\rwork collaboratively on such topics as benchmark assessments, curriculum unit assessments, and writing rubrics.
