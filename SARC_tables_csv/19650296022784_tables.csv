These professional development days are\raligned with the Board of Education’s annual goals and Strategic Plan, goals which ensure academic achievement for all while closing the achievement\rgap for statistically significant sub-groups. Staff development is selected to address district strategic goals.\r\rDuring the 2017-18 school year, the focus was on the ELA/ELD standards and the curriculum which was selected to deliver instruction: Benchmark\rAdvance/Adelante curriculum.   The MHS staff, along with the other two elementary school staffs, participated in examining the curriculum and learning\rdifferentiated grouping techniques.\r\rDuringthe 2018-19schoolyear,our three dayswillbeusedintwo ways.Our first dayincludedadditional timetoexaminethe Benchmark\rAvance/Adelante ELD and intervention curriculum and develop a curriculum map reflective of Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.\rThe second two days will be devoted to Covey Training on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  This training addresses communication and\rcollaboration; independence and interdependence; and the impact individuals have on an organization.  The training will provide a foundation and\rcommon language for our staff as we continue to work on creating a school climate of mindfulness.\r\rDuring the 2019-20 school year, the focus has been on social-emotional learning, technology integration, writing instructional strategies, and NGSS.\r\rAdditional staff development has been/is delivered at monthly faculty meetings, monthly professional development meetings; during grade level release\rtime and through attendance at various conferences. All teachers at every grade level participated in Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) training\rprovided by the UCLA Math Institute. Recent topics that have been addressed include the evaluation of student writing, the examination of multiple\rmeasures, differentiated learning strategies, Thinking Maps, Project Lead the Way, Project-Based Learning (PBL),  and Common Core State Standards.\r\rTeachers are supported through their Path I (feedback after formal observations) and Path II plans (these plans plan address teaching standards agreed\rupon by teacher and principal).  Additionally, grade-level meetings, data analysis meetings, and peer planning meetings allow teachers to learn from\rtheir peers.  ... Unnamed: 6
