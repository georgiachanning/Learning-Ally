Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.  Based on the analysis of our data, our\rInstructional Leadership Team determined that our focus for professional development would be on Visible Learning including teacher clarty in Math,\rand Collaborative Conversations.

At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.  Based on the analysis of our data, our\rInstructional Leadership Team determined that our focus for professional development would be on Visible Learning including teacher clarty in Math,\rand Collaborative Conversations.  We are also continuing our learning this year around Social Emotional Learning.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.

At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.  Based on the analysis of our data, our\rInstructional Leadership Team determined that our focus for professional development would be on Visible Learning including teacher clarty in Math,\rand Collaborative Conversations.  We are also continuing our learning this year around Social Emotional Learning.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.  Based on the analysis of our data, our\rInstructional Leadership Team determined that our focus for professional development would be on Visible Learning including teacher clarty in Math,\rand Collaborative Conversations.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.

Grade level collaboration meetings and professional development assist\rteachers in coordinating instructional strategies to maximize effectiveness.  Professional Development is also obtained through Professional Learning\rCycles where teachers go through a cycle of training, safe practice, peer observation, and revision.  At Rogers, we are implementing, Wilda Storm writing\rstrategies across all grade levels.  This is a solid research-based program providing many common core instructional strategies.  Wilda in conjunction with\rdistrict-adopted curriculum provides balanced literacy and increases overall school performance for all students.
