For support, teachers received professional developments from Educational Services, instructional coaches,\rprincipals, and workshops at Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers are apart of instructional learning walks where they observe their\rcolleagues instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers are being Google trained so they may use it as an\rinstructional tool and facilitate students presentations. In 2017-2020, teachers participated in GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) and CGI\r(Cognitive Guided Instruction) to assist in effective teaching strategies for all students, especially English Learners.

For support, teachers received professional developments from Educational Services, instructional coaches,\rprincipals, and workshops at Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers are apart of instructional learning walks where they observe their\rcolleagues instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers are being Google trained so they may use it as an\rinstructional tool and facilitate students presentations. In 2017-2020, teachers participated in GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) and CGI\r(Cognitive Guided Instruction) to assist in effective teaching strategies for all students, especially English Learners.

For support, teachers received professional developments from Educational Services, instructional coaches,\rprincipals, and workshops at Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers are apart of instructional learning walks where they observe their\rcolleagues instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers are being Google trained so they may use it as an\rinstructional tool and facilitate students presentations. In 2017-2020, teachers participated in GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) and CGI\r(Cognitive Guided Instruction) to assist in effective teaching strategies for all students, especially English Learners.

For support, teachers received professional developments from Educational Services, instructional coaches,\rprincipals, and workshops at Los Angeles County Office of Education. Teachers are apart of instructional learning walks where they observe their\rcolleagues instruction and share best practices. Technology has been a focus area and all teachers are being Google trained so they may use it as an\rinstructional tool and facilitate students presentations. In 2017-2020, teachers participated in GLAD (Guided Language Acquisition Design) and CGI\r(Cognitive Guided Instruction) to assist in effective teaching strategies for all students, especially English Learners.
