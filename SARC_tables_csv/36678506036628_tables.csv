Casey Elementary School has been thoroughly modernized over the past\rseveral decades. The most recent upgrades to the campus occurred in 2002 and included parking lot expansion and construction of a new before- and\rafter-school pick-up area for students. The chart displays the results of the most recent school facilities inspection as of August 2018. Any deficiencies\rlisted in the chart are added to the work order process when time and funding is available\r\rSchool Safety\r\rThe safety of students and staff is a primary concern of Casey Elementary School. All visitors to the campus must sign in at the office and wear a visitor’s\rpass at all times. Supervision is provided to ensure the safety of each student before school, during breaks, at lunch, and after school. Supervision is a\rresponsibility shared among parent/guardian volunteers, teachers, and administrators. To further safeguard the well-being of students and staff, a\rcomprehensive School Site Safety Plan has been developed by the School Site Council. The Safety Plan was most recently updated in March 2018; any\rrevisions and updates are reviewed immediately with the staff. Key elements of the Safety Plan focus on the following:\r•School rules & procedures\r•Disaster procedures/routine & emergency drills\r•Current status of school crime\r•Notification to teachers\r•Child abuse reporting procedures\r•School-wide dress code\r•Policies related to suspension/expulsion\r•Sexual harassment policy\r•Safe ingress & egress of pupils, parents/guardians, & school employees\rThe school is always in compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to hazardous materials and state earthquake standards. Safety drills,\rincluding fire, earthquake, and code yellow are held monthly.\r\rCleaning Process\r\rThe school provides a safe and clean environment for students, staff, and volunteers. The District’s Board of Education has adopted cleaning standards\rfor all schools in the district. Basic cleaning operations are performed on a daily basis throughout the school year with emphasis on classrooms and\rrestrooms. A joint effort between students and staff helps keep the campus clean and litter-free. The principal works daily with the school’s custodial\rstaff to develop sanitation schedules that ensure a clean, safe, and functional learning environment.\r\rMaintenance & Repair\r\rA scheduled maintenance program is administered by the school’s custodial staff on a regular basis, with heavy maintenance functions occurring during\rvacation periods. Additionally, a scheduled maintenance program is administered by Rialto Unified School District to ensure that school grounds and\rfacilities remain in excellent repair. Emergency repairs are given the highest priority; repair requests are completed efficiently and in the order in which\rthey are received.\r\rFacility Improvements / Deferred Maintenance\r\rThe district has a five year, Deferred Maintenance Plan designed to address expenditures for major repair or replacement of existing school building\rcomponents and any needed Facility Improvements. Typically this includes roofing, plumbing, heating electrical systems, interior or exterior painting,\rand floor systems.  ...  Unnamed: 8
