Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.\rCAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common\rCore State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering\rCalifornia’s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to\rgrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/\rLiteracy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test\ritems are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core\rState Standards (CCSS).\rThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and\rstate scores as well as the school’s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown\ronly for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank\rin the tables, no students met subgroup criteria.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.\rCAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common\rCore State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering\rCalifornia’s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to\rgrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/\rLiteracy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test\ritems are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core\rState Standards (CCSS).\rThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and\rstate scores as well as the school’s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown\ronly for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank\rin the tables, no students met subgroup criteria.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.\rCAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common\rCore State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering\rCalifornia’s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to\rgrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/\rLiteracy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test\ritems are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core\rState Standards (CCSS).\rThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and\rstate scores as well as the school’s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown\ronly for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank\rin the tables, no students met subgroup criteria.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.\rCAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common\rCore State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering\rCalifornia’s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to\rgrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/\rLiteracy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test\ritems are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core\rState Standards (CCSS).\rThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and\rstate scores as well as the school’s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown\ronly for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank\rin the tables, no students met subgroup criteria.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.\rCAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common\rCore State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering\rCalifornia’s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to\rgrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/\rLiteracy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test\ritems are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core\rState Standards (CCSS).\rThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and\rstate scores as well as the school’s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown\ronly for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank\rin the tables, no students met subgroup criteria.

Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs.\rCAAs items are aligned with alternative achievement standards, which are linked with the Common\rCore State Standards (CCSS).  CAASPP results are a measure of how well students are mastering\rCalifornia’s standards in English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, and are given to\rgrades three through eight and grade eleven. SBAC tests assess student performance in ELA/\rLiteracy and mathematics utilizing computer-adaptive tests and performance tasks, and CAAs test\ritems are aligned with alternative achievement standards which are linked with the Common Core\rState Standards (CCSS).\rThe CAASPP results shown in this report include overall results comparing the school, district and\rstate scores as well as the school’s overall score in each applicable subgroup. Results are shown\ronly for subgroups with ten students or more taking the exam. For those categories that are blank\rin the tables, no students met subgroup criteria.
