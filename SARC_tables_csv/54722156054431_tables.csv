Teachers are supported through follow up meetings with administration to discuss student work analysis,\rdistrict and classroom assessment data protocol, and grade level meetings to determine intervention and next level work for students who are struggling\rand excelling.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,043$45,252School Site-$10,927$1,819$9,107$76,590\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$69,279$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,107\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,035$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$108,746$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$0$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$126,825$124,686\rSchool Site/District0.08.3\r\rSchool Site/ State0.219.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Teachers are supported through follow up meetings with administration to discuss student work analysis,\rdistrict and classroom assessment data protocol, and grade level meetings to determine intervention and next level work for students who are struggling\rand excelling.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,043$45,252School Site-$10,927$1,819$9,107$76,590\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$69,279$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,107\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,035$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$108,746$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$0$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$126,825$124,686\rSchool Site/District0.08.3\r\rSchool Site/ State0.219.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.

Teachers are supported through follow up meetings with administration to discuss student work analysis,\rdistrict and classroom assessment data protocol, and grade level meetings to determine intervention and next level work for students who are struggling\rand excelling.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,043$45,252School Site-$10,927$1,819$9,107$76,590\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$69,279$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,107\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,035$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$108,746$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$0$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$126,825$124,686\rSchool Site/District0.08.3\r\rSchool Site/ State0.219.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Teachers are supported through follow up meetings with administration to discuss student work analysis,\rdistrict and classroom assessment data protocol, and grade level meetings to determine intervention and next level work for students who are struggling\rand excelling.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative SalariesFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average forAverage\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rAmount\rCategory\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$51,043$45,252School Site-$10,927$1,819$9,107$76,590\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$69,279$65,210D---is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,107\rHighest Teacher Salary$89,035$84,472S- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$64,941.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$108,746$107,614\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$0$112,242Average\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$0$\rSalary\rSuperintendent Salary$126,825$124,686\rSchool Site/District0.08.3\r\rSchool Site/ State0.219.9\rState Average for\rDistrictNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmount\rCategory\rThe California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\rTeacher Salaries32%31%2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\rAdministrative Salaries4%7%\r\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...
