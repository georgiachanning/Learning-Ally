Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors. The District provides mentors or coaches for new teachers. We\rplan to institute a powerful system of professional development with follow-up that will significantly impact the effectiveness of new instructional\rstrategies.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors. The District provides mentors or coaches for new teachers.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.

Nishimoto teachers have\ra significant role in school decision-making. This is fostered by the Professional Learning Community model, which has a strong staff training component\rbased on school goals. Grade-level teams meet periodically with teachers from the grade level above and below for vertical articulation. At the bi-weekly\rmeetings, we discuss student work samples and make adjustments to instruction as needed. Illuminate is data management software that collects and\ranalyzes data to help us assess student progress.We train all teachers on the Illuminate system so that we can make effective use of its capabilities.\rGrade-level team leaders meet monthly. They communicate the business of these meetings to their team members. In addition, they act as mentors for\rthe new teachers on their teams. The new teachers have been assigned on site mentors.
