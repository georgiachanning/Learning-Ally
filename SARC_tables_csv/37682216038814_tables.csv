The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district-wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2019-20 school year all teachers at Palmer Way will receive approximately\r30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This professional development\rwill empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands-on, research-based professional\rdevelopment, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath\radoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education researchers. A focus on\rprofessional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAASPP data. In the area of\rlanguage arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework. The ELA/ELD framework\rprofessional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the need for teachers to be\rexcellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have been delivered through\rteacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and during individual teacher\rplanning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and English Language\rDevelopment. We also have credentialed teachers that provide Engineering is Elementary lessons for students. This provides opportunity for the\rLanguage Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all teachers will receive staff development in the implementation of\rour newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous reading, our district office has adopted the American Reading Company\r100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff development on the implementation and best practices used for these reading baskets for students. Our\rcounselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver\rthis curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional\rdevelopment on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students.\rof focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams\rcollaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific training to support the needs\rof English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting\rthe unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade-level teams, and\rthrough individual mentoring by the school administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one and two\rteachers. Teachers who are experiencing difficulty or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.\r\rIn addition to district level professional development focused around English language arts and math, Palmer Way also has a strong focus on Writing.\rMany hours of professional development are spent on identifying, studying and implementing Writing Strategies  At Palmer Way we believe that the\rskills most important to develop in young children, is a love of reading and writing. A child with a book or pencil in her hands is a child with a bright future\rin front of her.  Reading and writing may be looked at as fundamental skills within the classroom, but their use remains essential long after one’s formal\reducation comes to an end. Living in the digital age has made literacy even more important, as communicating professionally via writing is an important\rskill in most workplaces.  At a time when professionals spend one third of their time reading and writing emails, written communication is more important\rthan ever before for success in academics and beyond. The earlier in life writing skills are developed, the stronger these skills will be in the long run,\rhighlighting the importance of writing in elementary school.  ... Unnamed: 6

The district calendar earmarks\rfull days and early release time for providing site-based professional development for all teachers. Teachers also have opportunities to attend conferences\rand district-wide professional development throughout the year. During the 2019-20 school year all teachers at Palmer Way will receive approximately\r30 hours of professional development in mathematics through the University of California Irvine subject matter project. This professional development\rwill empower our teachers to deliver a cohesive, common core curriculum based on the CCSS. The project includes hands-on, research-based professional\rdevelopment, standards-based curriculum guides and unit plans aligned to the Common Core to assist our teachers in the implementation of our GoMath\radoption. The Irvine Math Project team is comprised of classroom practitioners, math content experts, and math education researchers. A focus on\rprofessional development around the area of mathematics and ELA was selected in response to the needs highlighted in our CAASPP data. In the area of\rlanguage arts, all of our teachers will receive in-depth professional development in the California ELA/ELD framework. The ELA/ELD framework\rprofessional development has been selected as an area of focus due to our high numbers of English language learners and the need for teachers to be\rexcellent discerners of curriculum and materials needed to deliver robust and rigorous lessons. Both these areas of focus have been delivered through\rteacher release days, bi-weekly data team meetings, collaboration days and weekly staff meetings, off the clock offerings and during individual teacher\rplanning days. We have four Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) that provide workshops in the area of Language Arts and English Language\rDevelopment. We also have credentialed teachers that provide Engineering is Elementary lessons for students. This provides opportunity for the\rLanguage Arts and ELD workshops. With our new English Language Arts adoption, all teachers will receive staff development in the implementation of\rour newly adopted BENCHMARK materials. To support daily, robust and rigorous reading, our district office has adopted the American Reading Company\r100 book libraries. All teachers will receive staff development on the implementation and best practices used for these reading baskets for students. Our\rcounselors have received training on the Sanford Harmony social-emotional curriculum which they will deliver in each classroom. Counselors will deliver\rthis curriculum in all classrooms while teachers support the implementation and lesson delivery. In addition, all teachers have received professional\rdevelopment on how to run restorative circles in their classrooms in order to deliver Tier I positive behavior interventions and supports to all students.\rof focus for teacher training include effective instructional strategies for implementation of Common Core Standards, best practices for Data Teams\rcollaboration, ELA Benchmark curriculum, curriculum training in writing, language arts and mathematics, as well as specific training to support the needs\rof English Learners. Teachers of students with special needs and teachers of newcomer students also receive specialized training to assist them in meeting\rthe unique needs of their students. This professional development is provided in various formats, including whole staff group, grade-level teams, and\rthrough individual mentoring by the school administrator. The District also assists in the coordination of BTSA Induction Support for year one and two\rteachers. Teachers who are experiencing difficulty or need improvement have access to the PAR (Peer Assistance Review) Program.\r\rIn addition to district level professional development focused around English language arts and math, Palmer Way also has a strong focus on Writing.\rMany hours of professional development are spent on identifying, studying and implementing Writing Strategies  At Palmer Way we believe that the\rskills most important to develop in young children, is a love of reading and writing. A child with a book or pencil in her hands is a child with a bright future\rin front of her.  Reading and writing may be looked at as fundamental skills within the classroom, but their use remains essential long after one’s formal\reducation comes to an end. Living in the digital age has made literacy even more important, as communicating professionally via writing is an important\rskill in most workplaces.  At a time when professionals spend one third of their time reading and writing emails, written communication is more important\rthan ever before for success in academics and beyond. The earlier in life writing skills are developed, the stronger these skills will be in the long run,\rhighlighting the importance of writing in elementary school.  ... Unnamed: 11
