It\rdoes not matter how long you have been working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are still new skills to be learned.\rThis is the concept behind professional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School District.\r\rEach year, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is scheduled on the day before the first\rday of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The third day is scheduled at the end of the second\rtrimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days in order to allow all staff to participate in learning activities.\r\rFor classified staff, the focus of these learning days is based upon the learning needs of each department in the school district.  Learning for custodians\rmay focus on the correct use of new equipment that has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Learning for kitchen staff may\rfocus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their learning on new office\rsoftware or on social-emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each department lead will consider the needs of the\rstaff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  For example, all staff members at all levels are being trained\rin appropriate response techniques in an active shooter situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a consulting firm.  The training\rteam then conducts training for different department staff members on different days during the school year, until all staff members have been trained.\r\rFor certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2017-2018 on specific high impact\rinstructional practices.  The Robla School District, in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in Education (REEd)  Center at the University of California\rat Davis, has defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These research-based practices focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific\rstudentbehaviorswhichincreaseactivelearning,languageproductionandhigher-levelthinkingintheclassroom.Anotherareaoffocusis\rSocial/Emotional Learning which provides specific strategies for ensuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically and emotionally.\r\rProfessional Learning Support Teachers (PLSTs)then provide on-going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for\rimplementation.  The PLSTs are classroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and one at sixth grade, offer\rsupport in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as a substitute in a classroom to\rallow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has shown exemplary skill with a certain teaching technique.  They\rmight team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real-time as the lesson is taking place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels\rand all levels of experience.  A teacher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our professional learning.\r\rPLSTs and Principals receive on-going training in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporting teachers.\rSpecial coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are then encouraged to put\rthem into practice.  Follow-up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and refine their skills.\r\rProfessional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  PLC training was provided to all teachers\rand administrators during the 2017-2018 school year.  Our system has been designed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.\rClassroom teachers meet in grade-level teams at their school on a weekly basis when their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.  ...

It\rdoes not matter how long you have been working as a teacher, an administrator, as a bus driver or as a custodian, there are still new skills to be learned.\rThis is the concept behind professional learning days that take place throughout each school year in the Robla School District.\r\rEach year, the school schedule includes professional learning days for all staff.  The first professional learning day is scheduled on the day before the first\rday of school.  The second day is scheduled at the end of the first trimester of the school year.  The third day is scheduled at the end of the second\rtrimester of the school year.  Students in the district do not attend school on these days in order to allow all staff to participate in learning activities.\r\rFor classified staff, the focus of these learning days is based upon the learning needs of each department in the school district.  Learning for custodians\rmay focus on the correct use of new equipment that has been purchased for use by the custodian in their cleaning duties.  Learning for kitchen staff may\rfocus on the use of new equipment or on healthy meal planning or scratch cooking techniques.  Secretaries may focus their learning on new office\rsoftware or on social-emotional learning practices for use with students who come to the office.  Each department lead will consider the needs of the\rstaff, seek input from staff members or may be directed to focus on a specific learning need.  For example, all staff members at all levels are being trained\rin appropriate response techniques in an active shooter situation.  A district team was trained in specific techniques by a consulting firm.  The training\rteam then conducts training for different department staff members on different days during the school year, until all staff members have been trained.\r\rFor certificated staff, teachers, administrators, and specialists, professional learning has focused since the start of the 2017-2018 on specific high impact\rinstructional practices.  The Robla School District, in partnership with the Resourcing Excellence in Education (REEd)  Center at the University of California\rat Davis, has defined specific guidelines around effective teaching.  These research-based practices focus on specific teacher behaviors and specific\rstudentbehaviorswhichincreaseactivelearning,languageproductionandhigher-levelthinkingintheclassroom.Anotherareaoffocusis\rSocial/Emotional Learning which provides specific strategies for ensuring schools are calm and students feel safe physically and emotionally.\r\rProfessional Learning Support Teachers (PLSTs)then provide on-going support for staff as they take these practices back to their classrooms for\rimplementation.  The PLSTs are classroom teachers who work in pairs.  Each pair, one at first grade, one at fourth grade and one at sixth grade, offer\rsupport in a variety of ways.  They might come to a classroom and model a specific teaching practice.  They might serve as a substitute in a classroom to\rallow the teacher to leave and observe another teacher at his/her grade level who has shown exemplary skill with a certain teaching technique.  They\rmight team teach a lesson with a teacher and offer coaching in real-time as the lesson is taking place.  PLSTs are available to teachers at all grade levels\rand all levels of experience.  A teacher may contact them directly for support with all practices that are the focus of our professional learning.\r\rPLSTs and Principals receive on-going training in coaching techniques to ensure that they are gaining skill in effective practices for supporting teachers.\rSpecial coaching training sessions take place throughout the school year.  Specific techniques are discussed and coaches are then encouraged to put\rthem into practice.  Follow-up training sessions allow coaches to share their experiences and refine their skills.\r\rProfessional Learning Communities (PLCs) are also at the core of professional learning for all certificated staff.  PLC training was provided to all teachers\rand administrators during the 2017-2018 school year.  Our system has been designed to allow teachers to meet in PLC teams throughout the school year.\rClassroom teachers meet in grade-level teams at their school on a weekly basis when their students are in enrichment activities with enrichment teachers.  ...
