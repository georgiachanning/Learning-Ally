[9 rows x 6 columns],    District maintenance and site custodial staff ensures that the repairs necessary to keep the school in good\rcondition are completed in a timely manner. School employees communicate non-routine maintenance\rrequests by submitting work orders, which are addressed in a timely manner.  Morning inspections by the\rmaintenance staff ensures that the facilities are cleared of any safety hazards before the students and teaching\rstaff arrive.\rThe school counts with three shared maintenance workers to ensure the premises are kept safe for everyone.\rThese three workers are responsible for cleaning the classrooms, offices and restrooms, general maintenance\raround the school, grounds keeping, lunch area setup and cleanup, and trash removal. Restrooms are\rchecked regularly throughout the day for cleanliness and subsequently cleaned as needed. The principal and\rCBO meet with custodial staff daily concerning maintenance and school safety issues.\rA few years ago, the district invested in a new gym floor to help increase school spirit. Maintenance of the gym\rfloor has been performed as needed to ensure students and staff enjoy the facility. LED lighting has more\rrecently been installed throughout the campus, and the student restrooms have been remodeled. To improve\rcampus security, cameras have been installed in various strategic locations around campus, and these\rcameras are monitored constantly for suspicious or other inappropriate activity. Also, a buzzer lock system has\rnow has been installed at the main entrance to the school. Currently, there is work being done on roofs to\rupdate them to ensure rainwater does not sip through into the classrooms.\rSchool Facility Good Repair Status\rThe maintenance personnel use the Facility Inspection Tool (FIT) to conduct an annual inspection of the\rfacilities. The purpose of the FIT is to determine the adequacy of the school facilities to provide a safe and\rnurturing learning environment and to identify any areas that require repairs. The most recent inspection was\rconducted on January 7, 2020 and the results from the inspection were satisfactory in all areas assessed. The\rareas included in the inspection are all in good condition. In previous years, the restrooms ranked “fair,” but\rthe remodeling done this year has greatly improve the facilities. The overall rating from the evaluation for the\rentire school facility was good. The following table shows the rating for each of the areas inspected in the\rreport.\rThe most recent FIT inspection was conducted on January 7, 2020 and the Overall Facility Rate was good.\rThe table below shows the rating for each critical area covered by the FIT inspection.\rRepair Needed and\rSystem InspectedAction Taken or Planned Action\rGoodFairPoor\rSystems: Gas Leaks,\r✓---\rMechanical/HVAC, Sewer\rInterior: Interior Surfaces✓---\rCleanliness: Overall Cleanliness, Pest/\r✓---\rVermin Infestation\rElectrical: Electrical✓---\rRestrooms/Fountains: Restrooms,Student restrooms were\r✓--\rSinks/ Fountainsrecently remodeled.\rSafety: Fire Safety, Hazardous\r✓---\rMaterials\rStructural: Structural Damage, Roofs✓---\rExternal: Playground/School Grounds,\r✓--\r-\rWindows/ Doors/Gates/Fences  ...

[1 rows x 5 columns],    Suspensions and Expulsions\rDuring the school year 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19, none of the students in Baker Elementary School were\rsuspended or expelled. These data very closely resemble the district averages and are significantly below the\rstate suspension and expulsion averages.\rSchoolDistrictState\rRate (Percents)\r2016-172017–18 2018–192016–17 2017–18 2018–192016-172017–18 2018–19\rSuspensions------0.80----3.603.503.50\rExpulsions------------0.100.100.10\rSchool Safety Plan (School Year 2019–20)\rBaker Elementary School’s Safety Plan is a document with information pertaining to the proper way of\rresponding in the event of an emergency or an unforeseen situation. The plan is revised and updated as\rneeded by the School Site Council once per year. The date it was last reviewed and discussed by the School\rSite Council was in October 2019.\rThe key elements included in the School Safety Plan include:\r●Organizational Roles and Responsibilities. This section details what is expected from each of the\rindividuals who respond to an emergency, including staff, administration, and first responders. It also\rcontains details about what information is released to the public and who is responsible for releasing\rthat information.\r●Functional Content. This section includes details on what the appropriate response should be of a\rvariety of specific emergencies, including fires, earthquakes (drop, cover and hold), evacuations,\rlockdowns, shelter-in-place, medical and mental health and security in general.\r●Other Hazard and Threat Specific Situations. This section details the procedures in case of a hazard\ranalysis, an active shooter situation, a hostage situation, a bomb threat, an incident of terrorism, other\rnatural disasters (flood, severe weather, etc.), a chemical accident, an explosion, a bus accident, and a\rbiological hazard or blood borne pathogen.\r●Recovery and Mitigation. This section includes information on how to reduce the stress caused by an\remergency situation as well as the proper way of record keeping and cost analyses.\rThe Civil Grand Jury visited our district campus on December 5, 2018.  The purpose of the visit was to\revaluate our district’s safety preparedness in the event of a natural disaster, or traumatic event.  We were one\rof the districts randomly chosen throughout the county to be visited and during their visit, we participated in a\rQ&A regarding safety, and they toured the campus to inspect.  They were pleased to find several updated\rsafety features that have been implemented in order to better protect our students, visitors, and staff.  Some of\rthe new updated safety features include Raptor, an online registration system for all visitors entering the\rcampus.  We also have installed extensive cameras throughout the school grounds to monitor activity 24 hours\ra day.  Another addition in progress is additional fencing surrounding the perimeter of the campus, to name a\rfew.\rAll in all, the findings from the visit were positive and there were no recommendations at this time.\rWe conduct regular fire drills, and we participate annually in the Great American Shakeout for earthquake\rpreparedness.  We are also updating our bell system to feature multiple rings categorized for specific drills.\rOur job is to create a safe environment for our children so that they can receive the best education possible.\rSafety is a key district priority and we take it very seriously.  ...
