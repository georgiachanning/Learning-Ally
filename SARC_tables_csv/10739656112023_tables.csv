Professional development (PD) consists of weekly early\rdismissal days for TK-6 students. This time is used for site-level meetings, district-wide grade-level meetings, professional development, and outside\rpresenters.All grade-level teams participate in district-wide training with their grade level colleagues as needed for increasing proficiency and\runderstanding of curriculum and best practices. Site staff training is focused around further development of Professional Learning Communities (PLCs),\rthat focuses on the analysis of student learning results and how to the use of student learning results to guide instruction, as well as increasing the use\rof strategies and resources specific to increasing vocabulary development and analysis of data by students. Site professional development is also focused\ron reading and writing with the goal of improving each student's ability to read by at least one reading level each year. Training to practice is insured\rthrough frequent classroom observations and feedback.\r\rTeachers in grades TK - 3 are being provided specific training on guided reading and small group instruction.
