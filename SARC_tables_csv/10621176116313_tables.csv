Weekly planning opportunities are provided for teachers on Wednesday early release days to coordinate\rand plan lessons or units as an entire grade level. In addition, site funding is provided for teachers to take additional planning days to spend time looking\rover new ELA curriculum and other resources to better meet the needs of our students. Teachers will continue to receive training in the areas of math,\rClose Reading, diversity training and working with problematic students. The Second Step Curriculum was purchased through a grant that was written in\rJune. A presentation on the curriculum was held in October for parents. The staff is very excited about the implementation of this curriculum.\r\rTeachers also share research-based teaching strategies that will assist all students in making academic growth during Professional Learning Community\r(PLC) meetings. These weekly planning meetings assist with closely monitoring student growth. Instructional adjustments can be made to ensure teachers\rare provid-ing a challenging curriculum for those students excelling and provide support to those students struggling academically. Additionally,\rassessment data is reviewed, and Action Plans are developed to assist students. These Action Plans are then implemented and revisited every quarter.\rFor the 2018-19 school year, teachers will focus on one Essential Standard in math and ELA. Teachers will write assessments and have PLC meet-ings to\rlook over data and adjust their instruction where necessary. Mastery of the Essential Standard in ELA and math will assist all our students on the SBAC\rand district assessments. Building strategies and stamina at every grade level in the areas of math word problems and reading with justification will also\rsupport our students on the end of year assessments.\r\rTeachers acquire new knowledge through district workshops, curriculum rollouts, on-site training provided by administration, district personnel and\rconferences. Teachers are supported through principal observations and feedback. Clovis Elementary students continue to show academic progress due\rto our staff training. For-mal Progress Monitoring meetings are held twice a year with teachers and administration to review student assessment data.\rInformal meetings are held throughout the year. These meetings help to keep us focused on the academic progress of all students and target areas of\rconcern.\r\rParents are welcome to observe classroom instruction anytime, as long as they make arrangements with teachers prior to their visit and have been\rcleared through Megan’s Law and have taken a TB assessment.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.

A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school\ryear.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...

Weekly planning opportunities are provided for teachers on Wednesday early release days to coordinate\rand plan lessons or units as an entire grade level. In addition, site funding is provided for teachers to take additional planning days to spend time looking\rover new ELA curriculum and other resources to better meet the needs of our students. Teachers will continue to receive training in the areas of math,\rClose Reading, diversity training and working with problematic students. The Second Step Curriculum was purchased through a grant that was written in\rJune. A presentation on the curriculum was held in October for parents. The staff is very excited about the implementation of this curriculum.\r\rTeachers also share research-based teaching strategies that will assist all students in making academic growth during Professional Learning Community\r(PLC) meetings. These weekly planning meetings assist with closely monitoring student growth. Instructional adjustments can be made to ensure teachers\rare provid-ing a challenging curriculum for those students excelling and provide support to those students struggling academically. Additionally,\rassessment data is reviewed, and Action Plans are developed to assist students. These Action Plans are then implemented and revisited every quarter.\rFor the 2018-19 school year, teachers will focus on one Essential Standard in math and ELA. Teachers will write assessments and have PLC meet-ings to\rlook over data and adjust their instruction where necessary. Mastery of the Essential Standard in ELA and math will assist all our students on the SBAC\rand district assessments. Building strategies and stamina at every grade level in the areas of math word problems and reading with justification will also\rsupport our students on the end of year assessments.\r\rTeachers acquire new knowledge through district workshops, curriculum rollouts, on-site training provided by administration, district personnel and\rconferences. Teachers are supported through principal observations and feedback. Clovis Elementary students continue to show academic progress due\rto our staff training. For-mal Progress Monitoring meetings are held twice a year with teachers and administration to review student assessment data.\rInformal meetings are held throughout the year. These meetings help to keep us focused on the academic progress of all students and target areas of\rconcern.\r\rParents are welcome to observe classroom instruction anytime, as long as they make arrangements with teachers prior to their visit and have been\rcleared through Megan’s Law and have taken a TB assessment.\r\rThe district focused all professional development activities around five identified needs:  first time best instruction, mastery learning, multi-tiered system\rof supports, implementation of the California Content Standards and NGSS Standards, and cultural relevant understanding. In the 2018-19 school year,\rthe district dedicated five professional development days for certificated staff.  Teachers were offered professional development opportunities on staff\rdevelopment days, substitute release days, and on early release days. A variety of after-school workshops were also offered throughout the school\ryear.One hundred mentors and one hundred and thirty-five participating teachers received ongoing professional development and classroom coaching\rthrough the CUSD Induction program.  In addition, all certificated teachers participated in site-based training and district sponsored training that included:\rcurriculum training, utilization of AVID strategies, Visible Learning, multi-tiered systems of support, and culturally relevant instructional practices.  ...
