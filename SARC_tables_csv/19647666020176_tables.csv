Outside of their regularly\rscheduled staff and grade level meetings, the district administration, (principals and superintendent), meet as needed to review, discuss, and be trained\rin different areas of focus that are deemed appropriate: Thinking Maps, Common Core Standards (CCS), Explicit Direct Instruction (EDI), Visible Learning\r(VL), K-3 Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD) training, Standards-Based Reporting, Illuminate, ST Math, Lexia Reading, Disaster and Safety\rAcademy Training, differentiated instruction, assessment and testing, the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP), Professional Learning Collaboratives\r(PLC), textbook adoption, and English Language Learner instruction.\r\rThe teachers meet each week in regularly scheduled Grade Level Meetings, Professional Learning Collaboratives (PLC), and staff meetings, to plan and\rshare new ideas or target areas of focus for curriculum, instruction, and management.  When new textbook adoptions are being considered for the core\rareas, teachers take part in the publisher in-services on the appropriate implementation of the materials.  Teachers are expected to have a say in the\radoption process and are included, at the onset, in all reviews of instructional materials.\r\rGuest presenters come to the District to in-service teachers in areas that include: the California State Standards,  Thinking Maps, Explicit Direct Instruction,\rMind Math (JiJi), Lexia Reading, textbook alignments, differentiated instruction, classroom management, English Language Learner instruction, and\rspecial education strategies as well as Special Education Information System (SEIS) compliance.  The valued resources of our own internal and professional\rteaching staff are further utilized when necessary.  Teachers may attend trainings hosted by their ‘expert peers’ and colleagues in the areas of miscue\ranalysis; reading and math strategies; California Teachers of English Learners (CTEL) Training; the Writing Process; Science Technology Engineering and\rMathematics (STEM) conference, etc.  Once a focus area is identified, district and site-level in-services are provided to address the needs.\r\rThe Targeted Improvement Plan also helps school teams address their most challenging curricular areas (by grade level) so that the principal, and if\rnecessary, the district curriculum department, can write an action plan for improvement.  ...
