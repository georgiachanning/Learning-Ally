Specific goals include standards\rbased instruction and interventions for all students to ensure academic success in Language Arts and Mathematics. Our top academic goal is that all\rstudents read at or above grade level standard. Additional focus is on English Language Learners and providing instruction in English based on fluency\rlevels aimed at producing gains of at least 1 level per school year.

Interventions are based on RTI2 and behavior is taught and mionitored through a\rcomprehensive PBIS structure.\r\rProfessional development is directly related to the goals and includes weekly PLC collaboration, common planning time for grade levels, district provided\rmath and ELA common core training, student engagement strategies, and a full time academic coach available to support all staff with instructional\rpractices and planning. Kennedy employs two certificated teachers who provide academic support in small group settings.

Interventions are based on RTI2 and behavior is taught and mionitored through a\rcomprehensive PBIS structure.\r\rProfessional development is directly related to the goals and includes weekly PLC collaboration, common planning time for grade levels, district provided\rmath and ELA common core training, student engagement strategies, and a full time academic coach available to support all staff with instructional\rpractices and planning. Kennedy employs two certificated teachers who provide academic support in small group settings. These two teachers lead a\rstaff of six Instructional Assistants who also provide academic support in small groups.Professional development for our academic support team is\rprovided by site, District, and County level coaches on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on reading instruction and interventions.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average for\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameAverage\rAmount\rCategoryLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,417$49,084\rSchool Site-$5,709$543$5,166$69,692\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$71,897$76,091\r-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,266$77,881.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,141$95,728\rS- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$78,059.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$115,466$118,990\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$121,240$125,674\rAverage\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$140,350$137,589\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rSuperintendent Salary$179,747$230,096\rSalary\r\rSchool Site/District-56.8-10.6\rState Average for\rDistrictSchool Site/ State-82.1-12.5\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmountNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rCategory\r\rTeacher Salaries36%35%The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\r2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Interventions are based on RTI2 and behavior is taught and mionitored through a\rcomprehensive PBIS structure.\r\rProfessional development is directly related to the goals and includes weekly PLC collaboration, common planning time for grade levels, district provided\rmath and ELA common core training, student engagement strategies, and a full time academic coach available to support all staff with instructional\rpractices and planning. Kennedy employs two certificated teachers who provide academic support in small group settings. These two teachers lead a\rstaff of six Instructional Assistants who also provide academic support in small groups.Professional development for our academic support team is\rprovided by site, District, and County level coaches on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on reading instruction and interventions.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average for\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameAverage\rAmount\rCategoryLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,417$49,084\rSchool Site-$5,709$543$5,166$69,692\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$71,897$76,091\r-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,266$77,881.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,141$95,728\rS- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$78,059.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$115,466$118,990\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$121,240$125,674\rAverage\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$140,350$137,589\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rSuperintendent Salary$179,747$230,096\rSalary\r\rSchool Site/District-56.8-10.6\rState Average for\rDistrictSchool Site/ State-82.1-12.5\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmountNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rCategory\r\rTeacher Salaries36%35%The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\r2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Additional focus is on English Language Learners and providing instruction in English based on fluency\rlevels aimed at producing gains of at least 1 level per school year. Interventions are based on RTI2 and behavior is taught and mionitored through a\rcomprehensive PBIS structure.\r\rProfessional development is directly related to the goals and includes weekly PLC collaboration, common planning time for grade levels, district provided\rmath and ELA common core training, student engagement strategies, and a full time academic coach available to support all staff with instructional\rpractices and planning. Kennedy employs two certificated teachers who provide academic support in small group settings.

Interventions are based on RTI2 and behavior is taught and mionitored through a\rcomprehensive PBIS structure.\r\rProfessional development is directly related to the goals and includes weekly PLC collaboration, common planning time for grade levels, district provided\rmath and ELA common core training, student engagement strategies, and a full time academic coach available to support all staff with instructional\rpractices and planning. Kennedy employs two certificated teachers who provide academic support in small group settings. These two teachers lead a\rstaff of six Instructional Assistants who also provide academic support in small groups.Professional development for our academic support team is\rprovided by site, District, and County level coaches on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on reading instruction and interventions.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average for\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameAverage\rAmount\rCategoryLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,417$49,084\rSchool Site-$5,709$543$5,166$69,692\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$71,897$76,091\r-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,266$77,881.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,141$95,728\rS- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$78,059.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$115,466$118,990\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$121,240$125,674\rAverage\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$140,350$137,589\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rSuperintendent Salary$179,747$230,096\rSalary\r\rSchool Site/District-56.8-10.6\rState Average for\rDistrictSchool Site/ State-82.1-12.5\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmountNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rCategory\r\rTeacher Salaries36%35%The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\r2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.  ...

Additional focus is on English Language Learners and providing instruction in English based on fluency\rlevels aimed at producing gains of at least 1 level per school year. Interventions are based on RTI2 and behavior is taught and mionitored through a\rcomprehensive PBIS structure.\r\rProfessional development is directly related to the goals and includes weekly PLC collaboration, common planning time for grade levels, district provided\rmath and ELA common core training, student engagement strategies, and a full time academic coach available to support all staff with instructional\rpractices and planning. Kennedy employs two certificated teachers who provide academic support in small group settings. These two teachers lead a\rstaff of six Instructional Assistants who also provide academic support in small groups.Professional development for our academic support team is\rprovided by site, District, and County level coaches on an ongoing basis, with emphasis on reading instruction and interventions.\r\rFY 2017-18 Teacher and Administrative Salaries\rFY 2017-18 Expenditures Per Pupil and School Site Teacher Salaries\rState Average for\rDistrict\rCategory\rDistricts In SameAverage\rAmount\rCategoryLevelTotalRestrictedUnrestrictedTeacher\rSalary\rBeginning Teacher Salary$49,417$49,084\rSchool Site-$5,709$543$5,166$69,692\rMid-Range Teacher Salary$71,897$76,091\r-D--is--t-r ict------\rN/AN/A$9,266$77,881.00\rHighest Teacher Salary$96,141$95,728\rS- tate-------\rN/AN/A$7,506.64$78,059.00\rAverage Principal Salary (ES)$115,466$118,990\r\rAverage Principal Salary (MS)$121,240$125,674\rAverage\rAverage Principal Salary (HS)$140,350$137,589\rPercent DifferencesUnrestrictedTeacher\rSuperintendent Salary$179,747$230,096\rSalary\r\rSchool Site/District-56.8-10.6\rState Average for\rDistrictSchool Site/ State-82.1-12.5\rPercent of District BudgetDistricts In Same\rAmountNote: Cells with N/A values do not require data.\rCategory\r\rTeacher Salaries36%35%The California Department of Education issued guidance to LEAs on August 1,\r2018, regarding how to calculate school-level per-pupil expenditures that will be\rAdministrative Salaries6%6%\rreported on 2018-19 report cards.\r*For detailed information on salaries, see the CDE Certificated Salaries &\r\rBenefits webpage at www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/cs/.
